8-Dec-23,"Joe's is a must if you visit NYC. Ambience, service, and of course the food are all phenomenal. Don't waste your time getting the $1 pizza elsewhere. The line is well worth the wait for an iconic and TRUE New York style pizza! All slices and pies are incredibly fresh and this location has a nice outdoor eating area. Prepare to wait in line but again, you won't regret it."
8-Dec-23,"Excellent choice for a late night slice, the line is long but moves quickly and efficiently."
4-Dec-23,"We came to the city for a couple of days after two weeklong vacation in Morocco. We lived in New York City for about a decade about 20 years ago so we are pretty familiar with the layout, the train system, etc. My husband googled a list of things to do in the city and eating a slice at Joe's Pizza came up. Apparently many more people stumbled upon this list because the line was absolutely crazy like two blocks long.Luckily, things moved quickly, and we got our slices and Snapple's. The pizza is actually very good. It doesn't fold over and ooze cheese like you see in the movies it is actually very crispy. The reason why it doesn't ooze cheese all over the place is because it is actually not greasy at all and I didn't have to fold it or even hold it with a napkin to eat it. I remember back in the day I had to mop up the grease with my napkin before eating my pizza. I think it's because he used good quality ingredients. Do I recommend this place? Yes, the pizza is fantastic. Would you be comfortable while eating it? No, it is meant to be eaten standing around in a corner or walking, which is a little hard to do in the city because there's a lot of people, but it is an experience. You can also order a pie and take it to go. .."
3-Dec-23,"the pepperoni pizza was so yummy & worth the wait. we waited for like an hour, if you're ordering a whole pizza you don't have to wait in line!!! just go to the register. the inside was also sooo pretty"
2-Dec-23,"DoorDashed from here.Got a cheese pizza at 11 PM. The pizza was HUGE, FRESH. The crust was thin and chewy yet crunchy. The cheese was super oozy and pull-y (if that's a term).I'm a fan."
1-Dec-23,The cashier kid was very friendly and nice love that he spoke Spanish as soon he notice that o was Guatemalan and he introduced me to his coworkers from Guatemala as well
29-Nov-23,"Pizza is good-- with pizza, it needs to have a good crispy to soft ratio and needs to be thin and have the right amount of salt (can't be sweet). This pizza checked all those boxes. It's really packed and the line was out the door on a Tuesday night although it did move pretty quickly. The inside is packed and you have to hunt for the first seat you see or you stand and eat-- that was expected though since it's a popular pizzeria in Times Square. Over all, if you're looking for good pizza, this will satisfy that."
27-Nov-23,Best NY pizza yet. I have tried others but Joe's on top of the list. Do not be afraid of the long line. It goes quick. There is no sitting area like other pizza places in the city though. So take note when needing a place to sit down and eat.
27-Nov-23,"Good pizza, and fast service! It's a popular spot near Times Square, so I imagine it gets a lot of traction from tourists. I love a good thin crust, which they nailed. I think it could've been even better if they had even more sauce + cheese on each slice. The white pizza was really good, while the fresh mozzarella felt a little flat flavor-wise. An in-and-out pace, so even though the place was busy, we didn't spent much time on line, and we didn't need to hang around too long to get seats / table space to quickly eat our food. Conversely, don't expect to come here for a sit-down meal!"
25-Nov-23,"I recently tried Joe's Pizza in NYC, which is a famous pizza spot. Although I was excited to check it out, I ended up waiting in line for about 30 minutes, which wasn't the best experience. The pizza itself was okay, but I have to admit that it wasn't worth the wait and the price per slice. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with my experience."
25-Nov-23,Amazing tomato sauce very. Employees always accurate with order and quick paced. Ambience very lively.
23-Nov-23,"Our first stop in New York was Joe's Pizza, and it did not disappoint.  We went there on a Friday around 1pm. I was expecting a longer line but thankful it wasn't too long. It took about 15 mins to get to the front of her line, but they were doing their best to make the line move as fast as possible.  I ordered a slice of the Supreme and a slice of the mozzarella with burrata. I loved how even though they're warming up the pizza for you, it still tasted very fresh. The dough was thin and crispy, and it wasn't oily or floppy at all.I'm so glad that I got to try Joe's Pizza and definitely will be coming back in the future."
21-Nov-23,Go for the experience and the quality pizza. Something about the sauce. The ingredients were ok. Lots of celebrities on the wall. Avoid rush hour. If the line is 20 people long that's short and should only take 10 minutes to get up front. If you order a full pie you have to wait for it. Best to order full pies ahead of time.
21-Nov-23,"I made the mistake of standing in line even though it wrapped around the corner. Someone said it was moving fast. ""Sure"" I told myself. 15 minutes I can do. It took 37 which is most definitely not worth two quite decent slices of pizza. If the line was fast I'd give them 5 stars."
18-Nov-23,Pizza by the slice is ready for quick pick up. They heat it up in the oven for you. You can also order whole pizza pies.  They are super quick. The line outside the restaurant is long but moves fast. Don't be discouraged. It's worth the wait. Staff are nice and efficient. It's keep it moving!!!  Love this place. Pepper flakes. Parmesan cheese. Oregano shakers are on the tables and bars for you to use.
17-Nov-23,The food is reallly good! I love it! The lines are really large but all the kind of pizzas are good!
17-Nov-23,"Any time I come to NYC I order my Joe's pizza to my hotel room. I don't bother going to their locations because they have crazy lines and ordering on yelp is so much easier and hassle free. I typically get the supreme pizza and the pie is huge with thin crispy crust and flavorful toppings. I especially like the granulated garlic powder and seasoning they give you. Sprinkle that on any slice and it provides that extra umph, love Joe's. Order it through yelp!"
16-Nov-23,"Always my favorite pizza place to go to in Manhattan. This is the first time I went to the one in Time Square. I want to say this was the best one I've been to. It wasn't crowded when I went so that was great. But once I sat down, the crowd popped up. Definitely a must have if you're in time square. Also a very reasonable price!"
16-Nov-23,"Good New York slice? Yes. Worth 30+ minute wait? Not really. I feel like this type of pizza is all over the city, not exactly worth the hype. The pizza was good, don't get me wrong, only if you're willing to wait a while and not have anywhere to really eat it. There is some seating inside but extremely packed and full. They have a small standing space outside but you're eating near the garbage can and piles of pizza boxes."
14-Nov-23,"Line was long but moved fast. There is very limited seating inside, just wish it was a bit more clean. Pizza was good but a bit greasy."
13-Nov-23,"I couldn't leave New York without indulging in the famed New York style pizza, and Joe's Pizza made the experience unforgettable.Arriving on a Monday night, the line at Joe's Pizza was quite long, The wait was undoubtedly worth it, as every bite of their pizza is a testament to the art of New York-style perfection.Opting for 5 slices between two people might sound excessive, but when faced with the enticing options at Joe's, it was a necessity. Each slice was a masterpiece, and what stood out was the delightful crunch in every bite. The perfect balance of a crispy crust and flavorful toppings made each moment a pizza lover's dream.Leaving Joe's Pizza, I couldn't help but marvel at the unforgettable taste lingering on my taste buds. It's no wonder this spot is a must-visit for pizza aficionados and newcomers alike."
10-Nov-23,Yum! Delicious and quick pizzaCame by on a Friday night and the line was wrapped around the corner. It went by very quickly and the workers were all very polite.We took our pizza across the street and ate it on some benches!
8-Nov-23,Long lines but it goes very fast. Best folding pepperoni and cheese slice NY pizza at its finest.
8-Nov-23,No lie to say this place serve one of the best pizza in NY. My friends and I I waited more than half an hour to get our hands on their pizzas. Service was quick and check out was such a pleasant experience since the guy up front was chill and fast at the same time. Definitely gonna come back here for more pizza.
7-Nov-23,"Came to this location near Time's Square for my first time trying New York style pizza (thin crust), and it did not disappoint. There was a long line, but the wait was well worth it. We ordered two slices each, and that was enough for us to be full :p We ordered Supreme 8/10 - This was the mostly meat option at Joe's with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, and onions. The Supreme had really nice flavor, but could lean slightly salty for some. The crust was nice and thin, and the toppings were generous. Caprese 10/10 - This was absolutely amazing and what made the meal for me. Looks very unassuming, but it might possibly be the pizza I've ever had. The Caprese features burrata and basil leaves, and was so fragrant I didn't know pizza could get any better than it already is. This is a must try if you visit Joe's."
7-Nov-23,"What is a first visit to NY without seeking out and tasting an authentic NY style pizza, eh? So, Joe's was one of the first hole-in-the-wall pizza shops that was highly.....HIGHLY....recommended to us, and fortunately, it was located in the very busy Times Square, just a couple of blocks from our hotel, so was very convenient to walk to.And yes, as expected the lines are constantly long here......when we were there in the middle of the afternoon, the line was only halfway down the block. On other days we walked by, we noticed the line extended down the block, all the way wrapped around the corner of the building and down half that block. Of course we were going to get this full NY pizza experience and wait in the line to get a taste of what so many people seem to be raving about.So, we finally got to the counter and noticed about a half dozen different pizzas to choose from.....hmmmm, how to choose, what to choose?! So, we kept it simple and went for one slice of Spinach and Garlic pizza and one slice of the Caprese pizza.Daaaang, the person who recommended this place was right.....these are super deliciously good pizza! My wife thought the spinach and garlic pizza was a bit salty, but I was ok with it. I enjoyed both of the pizzas we ordered. The pizzas were fresh hot out of the oven, ingredients all fresh and had excellent blend of flavors, but what really struck me were the pizza crusts. They were thin yet firm, crisp at the bottoms, and held all the ingredients on top.....unlike other pizzas I've tried where the crust is thin, floppy, and all the cheese slides right off when you pick it up.Great experience that I'd been waiting years for! Just wished there was a Joe's closer by, but I think it tasted that good with that amazing crust because of the NY water used :) Perhaps I'll pay my friend to carry a Joe's pizza back to California the next time she visits :D"
6-Nov-23,"Our visit to Joe's Pizza near Times Square was met with the usual long line, but as always, the wait was well worth it. We patiently waited for close to an hour, and our order was simple yet satisfying - three slices of pizza: the Caprese, Pepperoni, and Supreme.Each slice was a delightful experience. The Caprese slice showcased the freshness of the ingredients, the Pepperoni slice offered a classic, satisfying kick, and the Supreme slice was packed with flavor. What made it even more authentic was the thin and crispy crust, just like a true New York-style pizza should be.The ambiance at Joe's Pizza is bustling, but the lines move quickly. It's a testament to the efficiency of the place. The cashier was friendly and mentioned they make over 3,000 pizzas daily, which is a testament to their popularity and expertise.Our only regret? Not ordering more slices! Joe's Pizza has rightfully earned a spot on my list of must-eats for my next trip back to New York. If you're a pizza lover, the delicious slices at Joe's are a must-try, even if it means a bit of a wait. The quality, flavors, that thin, crispy crust, and the overall experience make it a true New York pizza gem."
5-Nov-23,"We ordered delivery from here on our first night in New York. It was a great example of NY pizza. Delivered fast, very fresh and tasty. We couldn't finish it by ourself, luckily the doorman was more than happy to help us out."
5-Nov-23,Don't believe the hype!!! But authenticity is there with a good variety. Line very long but moves quickly.
5-Nov-23,"Joe's Pizza was recommended by our hotel. It was featured in the movie Spider-Man so they have  gotten a bit of attention hence the long line, but it moved pretty quickly. I ordered a cheese pizza and spinach pizza. The cheese pizza was really thin but surprisingly perfectly balanced. There was a perfect amount of sauce and perfect amount of cheese, so you didn't feel a lacking on any of the main ingredients. The surprise factor that elevated the experience and the quality of the pizza is the CRUNCH. The dough is perfectly crunchy. The spinach slice was okay. The spinach itself was somewhat bitter. You could take a hints of garlic and butter that I think could and should have been more present. The price point was great. The restaurant was somewhat small on the inside so seating is limited but they have a stand up area outside for customers. Overall it was a really good pizza."
4-Nov-23,You might be surprised by the line around the block but believe me- it's totally worth the wait!We enjoyed our slice(s) outside in the outdoor seating!
3-Nov-23,Have lived in New York City for two years and finally tried joes. It's so good. Def on my top 10.
31-Oct-23,"Came here on a late Thursday night. Line was out the door but went by pretty quickly. The cashier was very charismatic. There is limited seating indoor and it gets pretty busy so I suggest taking your pizza to go. We ordered a slice of the white pizza, a slice of New York style pizza, and a pie of pepperoni. Everything was delicious!"
29-Oct-23,Pizzas are the best and I recommend calling ahead instead of waiting in line although it's not a terribly long wait.
28-Oct-23,"Overall not bad. Our intention was to go to the original location but this was on the way to where we were going. There was a slight hiccup with the order,.so we ended up with a white slice, cheese, and pepperoni. Pizza was nice and this with a slight crisp. However the white pizza was a little charred on the bottom. But for 3 slices and two drinks close to Times Square only $19 I won't complain"
27-Oct-23,"Joe's is well-rated, and for good reason. The small, efficient, and exceedingly busy pizza shop serves pizza straight out from the oven, should you order a whole pie, and the slices were so fresh I basically burned myself eating them. We got the Supreme on our first visit, and it was, aside from being utterly covered with meats, completely amazing. The burns were worth it, and I cannot recommend buying a whole pie enough."
27-Oct-23,"Definitely a worthwhile experience when in New York! Pizzas were delicious, my favorite was definitely the Supreme and Caprese. The Caprese had delicious fresh tomatoes, and the Supreme was packed with toppings. Can't go wrong with either!Personally, the white wasn't it for me. It felt pretty plain and lacked flavor. Expect a bit of a wait, since they do heat up the pizza before serving it to you. Probably took us about a 30 minute wait on a Sunday night at this particular location. There are some seats inside and some standing area outside to eat the pizza. Inside of the restaurant, it felt a little packed in my opinion, but it's probably because it's a popular destination. I would definitely come here again for the Supreme... but probably at a non-peak hour."
27-Oct-23,Obviously something you have to get when in NYC. Lines are long but service was quick. The base is thin but wasn't soggy. The crust was a bit crunchy for my liking. I think there needs to be a touch more sauce and cheese. Not bad though.
24-Oct-23,"Handsdown authentic New York pizza. Recently visited New York and this was a highly recommended place. I exceeded the expectations I had with their flavors. The Caprese with the fresh tomatoes and little burnt basil with that cheese; mind blowing and must try pizza. It was smelled good, tasted amazing. Fresh Mozzarella pie with that mozzarella on top, yummy!!!The pizza dough itself was so flavorful and right crisp to it. Overall amazing experience. Service:There was a big line in front of their restaurant and did all make sense once I took that first bite and they were quickly serving and clearing the line. Loved that they had option to add chili flakes, oregano and cheese to add on top according to you flavor. Must try place!! Can't skip. Just a recommendation if you are looking for a place to sit and enjoy, maybe pickup is the best option as the restaurant is usually fully packed."
23-Oct-23,"Joes pizza was all its hype said it was. Great my style pizza, with the lines to validate that. Must have waited 30 minutes but was worth every bite. Thin crusted pizza that does not sag in center slice point. Pretty amazing gravity defying pizza. Perfect balance of sauce, cheese to crust, makes joes the gold standsRd in NY style pizza."
22-Oct-23,"--Location/Parking--It's New York, what parking?--Ambience--New York pizza joint with a line out the door and crowds of people trying to eat in a small area. It is typical to see people eating a slide out on the sidewalks.--Service/Staff--The staff is fast and direct, getting you in and out as quickly as possible.--Food/Products--New York style pizza was piping hot. I think I burned my mouth, but the new York style is my favorite, and I can't complain.--Capacity--Very small, you see people lounging around eating on the sidewalk or outside or taking it to go.--Overall--One of the popular tourist spots in New York. If you ask a local about their favorite pizza spots, you will get various answers."
21-Oct-23,Really good pizza. They also had really quick delivery service which was nice! We will definitely eat here again
21-Oct-23,"You delivery was fine. However, the pizza was awful. Got a white pizza with pepperoni and pepper Cheney peppers. It also included something very crunchy and zero flavor."
21-Oct-23,"All these years I kept hearing about the legendary pizziarias of NYC.  This happens most of the time for me when my expectations don't meet my experience.  We stood in line, the place was packed, ordered a whole pizza, and ate it outside standing up.  Pizza was good but it wasn't the like hearing angels singing after the first bite. I love pizza but I'm not particular to any style.  This could be from all the regional styles to basic Midwest stuff as long as the taste, atmosphere, and quality is to your liking.  The best pizza is always the one you enjoy at that time with family and friends.If you're in NYC, you should definitely try one of these iconic pizzarias and make your own judgment.  What could be better than a pizza while traveling?  Enjoy life."
16-Oct-23,I am addicted and I do not care who knows it. I go here far too often and it's always delicious! Love the staff and love walking down the street eating my slice... making everyone jealous! Yum
15-Oct-23,It was good but to be honest I HAVE HAD BETTER! It was very disorganized and the workers were more about flirting with the girls versus making pizza and waiting on customers.
15-Oct-23,"The pizza is exactly what you expect during a visit to NYC! Yum! The line was long, but it moved quickly. Everyone was working really hard."
14-Oct-23,We visited from East Los Angeles and we wanted to see what New York Pizza fuss is about. I am a huge fan of New York style pizza and now I understand what makes this place so good. It looks simple but very tasty. Definitely worth it.
13-Oct-23,"There's a reason why there's always a long line for Joe's Pizza. They serve great NY style pizza! My wife and I waited about 45 minutes to place our order. The slices of pizza are about $5-6 each depending on which ones you get. We got the supreme, white, spinach and garlic, and pepperoni. All of them were excellent. Nice thin crust. Flavors were on point. There's not much seating and like I mentioned, it's busy and crowded. But it's worth coming here if you've never been here before. Enjoy yourself a nice authentic slice of NY pizza at Joe's! You won't regret it."
12-Oct-23,"Grabbed a slice for a quick bite. $5 for the slice size and proportions is a great price. Toppings tasted very fresh but crust is very crispy. Sauce has a zesty taste. Slice temperature was a little cold but overall very yummy and convenient for the location, price and hours of operation. Service was friendly!"
11-Oct-23,Tried this pizza place after hearing a lot about it. We ordered a whole cheese pizza and it was pretty good! The pizza was crispy and the sauce was good. I would definitely recommend checking it out since tos an iconic spot and the vibe inside is nice.
10-Oct-23,"We waited in line for this pizza, it was very good, fast service, they know how to handle a crowd. We actually found a couple of seats. We had a supreme slice and a spinach and garlic. I'm normally a meat lover's pizza kind of person, but I really enjoyed the spinach & garlic, so much flavor. And crust was thin but strong."
10-Oct-23,Great NYC pizza ... very busy but the service is fast ... The place isn't fancy but remember you are going in for good pizza and you won't be disappointed .
9-Oct-23,"The long lines, the wait, it's a flop y'all - I have better pizza in New York. They have limited sections and no beer."
9-Oct-23,"Lots of hype about this place.  We waited in line for a couple slices of pizza.  Bottom line, the pizza at Costco is better.  If this is NY pizza at its finest, I am not impressed."
7-Oct-23,"Totally over rated, not worth standing in line!!  There is very little difference between a regular $4 cheese slice from Joe's versus other $1 places which is just around the corner.   Joe's cheese is bit more elastic so it's more chewy and eating slice last longs as compared to $1 slice.  I say if should be $1.50 or max $2."
7-Oct-23,"of the 3 pizza shops we tried on our New York visit, joes was the best. that being said being from chicago has confirmed my hunch we do have the best pizza!"
6-Oct-23,"About a 30 minute line at 7 pm on Sunday nightThe only negative is EVERY  order gets a huge pizza box even if you tell them  you're eating it there    The pile of boxes in trash was disgusting and wasteful We had the slice with spinach, the caprese and the supreme   We liked the caprese the best   But it was all good We flew in from San Francisco and this was our first spot to eat   And then to Carlos bakery for a cannoli"
5-Oct-23,Solid pizza. Don't understand the crazy hype though to be honest. Didn't taste very different from other pizza.
4-Oct-23,A must if your in this area. Highly recommended to us by our close family friends from this area & it was Amazing. Nice & crispy pepperoni pizza & the perfect amount of sauce & cheese.
3-Oct-23,I'm from Phoenix Arizona and I'm always looking for fantastic food. The one place people told me to go is  New York. They have fantastic food so I gave Joe's Pizza try never again will I settle for standard pizza this pizzas a at 10 out of 10 I will definitely come back to New York to taste of cuisine in this beautiful city. God bless New York.
1-Oct-23,"Definitely a tourist trap, but if you're visiting NYC why not try Joe's Pizza at least once?  Is it a life changing slice of pizza? No. Was it worth standing over 45 mins in line for? Not for the pizza, but it was a nice memory seeing people from all walks of life coming together to try this pizza.Joe's Pizza is good in the sense it's everything a normal slice should be. However, the seasoning was a bit lackluster. Besides the crispiness of dough, the cheese and toppings were a bit tasteless. Pepperoni was probably the best just because it's naturally salty. Not really worth the wait, but something everyone should experience at least once in their life."
30-Sep-23,"Pizza was definitely legit but not really ""special"" compared to other authentic NY pizza places. Line was long as always but moved pretty fast. Will eat here every time I visit."
28-Sep-23,"In true NY fashion, the slices were HUGE and when there is a line out the door, you know this is the real deal. I ordered the margherita pizza and the tomatoes were SO fresh- like just picked out of the garden, cut up, and slapped on a pizza before heading straight into the oven. The crust was crispy, thin, and a lot easier to eat. For only $6, this was definitely a meal on the cheap. The line moves fairly quickly and there is an outdoor standing area where you can scarf down your slice(s)."
28-Sep-23,"The delivery was late, the pizza was burnt and soggy.I would not recommend this place to anyone."
27-Sep-23,"Wow! The pizza was stale, like it has been frozen or made the day before.As I'm in line waiting to get serviced I was observing others as they struggled to bite into a not fresh and cheesy slice. I ordered anyways ignoring this and thinking everyone was eating a cold slice.No cheese pull and taste like a lunch-able pizza.Horrible! Will not be back. Past experiences weredecent and fresh!  Not  good...."
25-Sep-23,"If you're looking for a classic representation of a NYC slice, this is it!  Joe's delivered on all cylinders.  Crispy & thin on the bottom, not overly greasy, perfect portion of bread, cheese, & sauce.  This slapped & brought back the days when I was a kid eating pizza in NYC that I will always cherish. ‚Å£Service is quick & precise.The ambiance is giving NYC grab & go energy.  If you do get a seat it's a nice vibe to just chat it up & enjoy that good ole crispy delicious pizza."
24-Sep-23,"Definitely have had better pizza. The line for this business was out the door, & down the street. Crust was very thin. Sauce was not saucy. Over crowded for what we got. Ambiance is lacking. Come in to look for a table and you won't find one. They were stacked with people."
24-Sep-23,"Amazing amazing pizza! This pie is from after 15min of walking in the rain, totally worth every step and every penny! Crispy, thin, delicious pizza. 10/10"
23-Sep-23,Stopped by this place for a quick meal. The line was not too long and it did move quite quickly. The pizza looked good and each slice was about $4-6! I was honestly a little disappointed since it was a alright slice of pizza but especially not for that price. I expected a little better considering the notoriety but I guess it can be considered overrated. Heard it was a must visit in NYC but I think you can pass on it.
23-Sep-23,We had to stop for Spider-Man sake & dang Joes Pizza did not disappoint it was so good! Always a long line but it went pretty fast. The white pizza is my fave !
21-Sep-23,Excellent joint but long lines. Its worth it. Exactly as seen in spider-man's Movie ........
19-Sep-23,"Ordered For delivery for pizza, this place was still open late at night. Couldn't choose if we wanted pepperoni or cheese, so was able to get both. The pizza arrived via bike from our door dash server, who was able to keep the pizza warm until we got it. The thin crust pizza drooped over like it was supposed to and had to fold the pizza to eat. Like both the pepperoni and the cheese. Thank you for the experience and not disappointing first time tourists to New York"
17-Sep-23,"(From a non native New Yorker) - I honestly can't help but love this place! I've tried all their flavors, and the best are regular cheese pizza and pepperoni! - affordable, $5 each slice - consistent quality every time - simple yet so good. Their tomato sauce is just perfect - I LOVE that the crust stays crunchy even until your last bite - fast service Joe's is a staple to NYC, and it's a must for your first time trip to the city."
17-Sep-23,Extremely overrated. The pizza was bang average probably because it wasn't fresh; They just make huge batches and warm it up when order which understandable because of huge queue.
16-Sep-23,"Yummy pizza, fast service, decent price point!!!Just the lines outside tell you how good the pizza is!!! And it is TASTY!!! Just like how new york pizza should be- perfect relatively thin and crispy (not even a tiny corner is soggy) crust and rt amt of sauce and cheeseWe got spinach with goat cheese!!! and plain slices. Do try this place and dont skip it looking at the line, it moves fast!"
15-Sep-23,Apparently one the beat pizza places in Manhattan. Long lines out the door any time of the day. Limited sitting area. Efficient staff!
15-Sep-23,"A decent slice of NY Pizza for $5 to $6 bucks which isn't bad for Times Square. Pizza is good, but I don't know that it was ""amazing"" like many said.No regrets going to Joe's, but I'll try some other places going forward. Also, it was a LONG line, but didn't take too long, maybe 20 minutes, to get through it."
14-Sep-23,"I would say Joe's Pizza lives up to the hype. We waited about 45 mins in line on a Monday night at 11pm. The slices were $4-5 which is a bit pricey but they were all great. The slices were thin and crisp and not very oily. Since some of the slices get reheated, my crust was a bit burnt of the end. It's definitely something worth trying! It was also cool to see all the pics of celebrities that have visited the restaurant."
14-Sep-23,"I am Italian and a picky eater. I went to try their pizza but I was skeptic. I was surprised it was good and different from the Italian style. It's a shame I didn't find any Italian pizza chef nor Italian American ones.  I've noticed that the majority of people in the hospitality industry are latinos/Spanish speakers. Don't mind I speak Spanish too and they're nice to talk to. I cannot tell about the ambience, the shelter in front of the establishment was a bit unpleasant, too hot and not so welcoming but it was for the food mostly for me."
14-Sep-23,"There was a 30 min wait for this place on a Friday at 9:30pm!!! But the pizza were well worth the wait. My favorite was the cheese with ricotta and then the Sicilian. The spinach was definitely over powering and the caprese was a bit interesting with the unmelted mozzarella. But the first two blew the waters for me. The crust was crunchy but Hume having a nice chew and the Sicilian was not soggy at all. The downside is that the pizza are already made so you choose from what they have by the counter and then they will heat it up for you. Also, since it's a thin crust, you have to eat it fairly quickly without the crust from being too hard. There was no seating inside so I recommend going to the seats across to get some outside seating. For a NYC pizza experience, this is a must besides the long wait line!!!"
12-Sep-23,"Spidey sense was tingling. Literally, spider man used to work here in the movie which I assume a fair portion of their fame is from that publicity. Came here first since it's a safe pick. A start off to get an idea of what New York style pizza is supposed to be like, it's about $5 a slice here. There's plenty of $1 slice places around that looks the same and I thought all of New York would be good, boy was I wrong, the quality is noticeable between the $1 and $5 ones. You can't miss this place, you'll spot the long ass line from far away. Surprisingly it moves fast, maybe because it's always fully staffed to the max and they have a system in place knowing that it will always be busy at all times of the day every day. Simple system; get in line, look at the menu in the meantime so you're ready to order by the time you're up front, once you pick your slice, you wait for your slice to heat up just a few moments in the oven. There's not really much space to sit and eat, you might just have to stand on the side of the street and murder your cheesy slice. Tell me about your experience if you've been here or is going to after reading this review:)"
12-Sep-23,"Really good pizza slices for such a great deal and the slices are pretty big and fulling. They are given to you hot, crispy at the bottom, and soft & cheesy on top. We didn't wait in any line so we were in and out fast. We stood outside and ate our slices by the window. The employees were friendly and took care of us right away."
11-Sep-23,Great pizza very quick service. Definitely avoid lunch rush hour or you will be waiting a long long time.
10-Sep-23,It's Joe's Spider-Man's pizza shop. What more is there to say. Have to try a slice to let others know you been to Joe's.
9-Sep-23,"Good pizza, it isn't the BEST pizza but it's certainly up there. Expect a long line but you have a lot to look at while waiting !"
8-Sep-23,"Went to Times Square store, got pretty crowded; 30min waiting line o order. Mobile order and pick-up worked great. Large pizza, very good taste!"
6-Sep-23,"We came to get the proper ""New York experience."" The pizza was good, nothing extra special about it. It's pretty small inside, but we were able to get seating. Be prepared to wait, although the line does move fast. It was very quick paced once we got to the front. The ambiance was nice tho, seeing pics of celebrities on the wall who have visited before. We would get it again!"
6-Sep-23,We stood in line for about 40 mins on Sunday night 9ish. We got lucky and was able to grab a couple of chairs. All the pizza were indeed very good and it made the waiting worthwhile.
5-Sep-23,"Joe's pizza is actually really great. Don't let the location fool you. Someone I know from New York told me last week that they would never go there because it's a tourist trap. I'll just say this. The line was super long but went pretty fast. And it was actually really good pizza. And I've had a ton of pizza. Highly recommend the white pie with spinach. We also got the pepperoni, combo and margherita slices too and they were all great.It's also fun looking around the wall at all the celebs that have eaten there."
4-Sep-23,"Wait was worth it.  It was pretty great.  My husband and I waited 35 min in line which went to the to the end of the block.  We shared 3 slices: supreme, fresh mozz, and pepperoni.  Our favorite was the supreme."
3-Sep-23,"It was ok, it was my first time to NYC and I had tried another pizza joint closer to my hotel and the pizza was a dollar a slice, that pizza I thought was better. Joe's kind of burnt my slice, the wait was too long for an ok kind of pizza. Staff is friendly but to me not worth the wait."
2-Sep-23,Line was so so long. Went around 11:30pm. Good news is that the line did go by quick. Waited about 20 minutes. Cheap $ and taste good
2-Sep-23,"Substantial slices that are tasty for a good price! We came on a Saturday early evening and there was barely a wait. There'll be a few pies to choose from, and my favorite by far was caprese. The cheese is a little plain, but nothing to complain about! One slice will fill you up, which is amazing for the price. There's a little patio outside with some seating where you can sit or stand and eat. Super solid stop for a filling snack/meal."
2-Sep-23,Og new york style pizza. No comments. Or just one. Its more than good Also if you want to skip the line just order a pie online
31-Aug-23,Definitely have to try Joe's Pizza if your in New York! Amazing pizza and amazing service! Be ready to wait in line a little bit but overall great service!
31-Aug-23,"You can always expect a solid slice of pizza at Joe's Pizza. My go-to is the fresh mozzarella with a thin crispy crust, tomato sauce, and creamy mozzarella cheese. Perhaps not the ""Best of New York"", but Joe's Pizza is a classic. This is a great place for a quick snack with multiple locations or ideal for catering too."
30-Aug-23,"Everyone around the area was telling us if we wanted pizza, this was the place to go. The line was always looking so it took us until the last night to brave the line. We stopped by after our show and the line went a little faster than we thought it would. Still waited about 30 mins, but service was pretty quick once you placed your order for slices. I got 4 slices and they were all cooked really well. Slices had good flavor, toppings were delicious, but I would've preferred a little more sauce. Just my preference. Next time I'll ask for a side of sauce. I think 30 min would be the absolute longest I would wait, but I did like it."
27-Aug-23,"Line out the door. The man at the counter was very nice and despite it being very busy, he did his best to make eye contact and answer your questions and smile. They made us a large mushroom pizza and it was delicious! Inside was a bit dirty, but expected in NYC. Pretty good. Been to other pizza places in NYC and not sure if I would necessarily wait in a long line for this place again. Definitely not bad, there are just many pizza options in NYC."
26-Aug-23,So thin and crispy. Love the extra garlic flavor. I recommend you come here when in NY
25-Aug-23,"Tasty pizza!  We were in NYC for a mere 24 hours, so of course I had to try an authentic slice.  We had broadway tickets at 7pm so we stopped at Joe's prior to the show.  The line was down the block at 5:15, but it moved fast and we were inside in about 15 minutes.  Got a few different varieties and it was great.  I would not say it was significantly different from some other pizzas I've had, but it was really good nonetheless."
24-Aug-23,"Small, bustling, overflowing place with tourists and locals alike means they're cranking out pies like Willy Wonka's steroid induced brother Joey Wonka bailed on his brother and opened up a pizza place and called it ""Joe's""!! Yes, the real Joe would contest this comparison but go there when a hundred people are lined up and all move out within minutes! A fun atmosphere, especially at midnight when the tourists are starving!  Go here or the village of you want a good slice and don't feel like going to Brooklyn!! Enjoy!"
20-Aug-23,"The line was very long (which was to be expected) but it went relatively quickly. It wasn't my favorite slice I had in New York but it was good. I wouldn't suggest going out of your way to get here, but it was in a good location and we were hungry! It's a pretty small space so be ready to be very close to others while eating!"
20-Aug-23,"Pizza muito boa mesmo, fazem delivery muito bom, vale muito a pena! Pre√ßo justo, a pizza chegou quentinha, del√≠cia!!"
17-Aug-23,"When a restaurant in a touristy area has a long line outside of it, it either has really good food or is a hype. I walked by Joe's Pizza a few different times and saw a long line every time. Dinnertime came around, and pizza came to mind, so I went over to Joe's and got in line. The line was a rather enjoyable experience. There were curious tourists who would come up and ask what people were in line for or if the wait is worth it, and there were those who would voice their discouragement as they walked past. As I was there later in the evening towards the tail end of dinnertime, the line was not too bad. After over half an hour, it was finally my turn. I wanted to try everything, but I had some degree of self-restraint and went with 3 slices instead. My 3 slices were pepperoni, supreme, and white with fresh spinach and garlic. New York pizza slices are huge, so 3 was well more than enough for me. The pizza was not mind-blowing or life-changing, but it was good pizza. The pepperoni and supreme were as expected. I like spinach so I really liked the white pizza, but it is not for those who do not like spinach or too much veggies. Joe's Pizza was worth the price, the wait, and the experience. I would not wait in line for more than an hour, but anything less than that is worth getting in line for. New York is pricey, but New York pizza is an affordable, tasty, and filling meal option."
17-Aug-23,"Go good! Just as advised!!! Go get some Spider-Man pizza!!! Service is fast! Place is small, but those are usually the best places! Enjoy some NYC pizza!"
17-Aug-23,What a treat! Amazing pizzas and very friendly staff! You can't be in NyC and not try one of their slice... or take a whole pie while you're at it!
16-Aug-23,"I'm a big fan of the thin, crispy crust. Every pizza is warmed upon ordering. I normally love my pizza loaded with toppings but my favorite here is actually the fresh mozzarella with basil!The line moves fast. There are some first-come first-served high tables to enjoy your pizza at."
13-Aug-23,"Pizza was just alright, nothing special or mind blowing. We had heard that we needed to try Joes pizza while in NYC, so we stopped by and ordered a slice of pepperoni. Service was good, there was a longish line of people but it moved quickly!Would not come again as there are definitely better spots for pizza in NYC."
12-Aug-23,"BEST pizza I've ever had!! In my opinion, classic cheese is the way to go with it being New York style pizza you can never go wrong with plain cheese!! Especially with it being THIS good here at Joe's. Also, love the whole atmosphere here! They've got all kinds of cool pics of celebrities that have been here, and it's just a really cute place. Cannot wait to come back!"
12-Aug-23,"Waited a long time for some great pizza! I would say the spinach and garlic + caprese pizza were a bit cold when we received them, but the hot pieces (cheese and Italian) were so worth the wait!"
10-Aug-23,"While walking toward Times Square at around 11 AM, we saw a line already forming. Taking our spot on the sidewalk, we quickly made our way to the counter for 4 slices of pizza. Everything was hot and fresh. Essential thin crispy giant slices of NY style pizza. The restaurant only got busier as we sat eating and the clock neared noon. Really enjoyed our lunch!"
10-Aug-23,"Ordered pizza for a party at a rehearsal studio in Chelsea for my band. Pizza's were fresh, hot and good. Fast delivery too.  Highly recommend!"
10-Aug-23,"Rating:  (5/5)Are you ready to indulge in the best pizza experience New York City has to offer? Look no further than Joe's Pizza! Despite the daunting 1-hour wait, I assure you, it's worth it!From the moment I stepped into Joe's Pizza, the ambiance instantly grabbed my attention. The place oozes a cool and unique vibe, making it an ideal spot to enjoy a delicious slice of pizza. The energetic atmosphere and authentic New York City feel only added to my overall experience"
8-Aug-23,"I'm sure everything that's worth saying about Joe's Pizza has been said by the thousands of reviews left before mine, but I think it's worth commenting on the service. Joe's Pizza is famous for having long lines stretching down the block no matter which location you go to, but even though it was crazy busy, the employees I interacted with at the counter all took time to greet us, and the cashier had a friendly conversation with me while waiting for my pizza to get boxed up. Maybe I had low expectations for friendliness in NYC, but everyone in the shop was nice to us, which made a difference in our experience.The pizza itself is.. perfectly fine. We got a slice of cheese, pepperoni, and white. I didn't get to eat a slice hot, but even so, I can usually enjoy pizza at any temperature. The only thing memorable about my eating experience was that the crust was dry to the point of inedible - and this is coming from a person who enjoys pizza crusts. I don't think I would return, but I'm glad I was able to visit an NYC pizza joint rich with so much history."
6-Aug-23,I have been here several times with friends. We usually get pepperoni pizza. To say it was delicious is an understatement. I would recommend this place to anyone at least once.
6-Aug-23,"Their nyc style is good, but the Sicilian is even better. I definitely recommend this place for their Sicilian (square) pizza. It's thick but the balance is yummy! Not sure what I can say that hasn't already been said. It's Joe's that's all you need to know"
6-Aug-23,Can't wait to return when I visit NYC again! It was the perfect amount of dough to toppings ratio. It's a must have!
5-Aug-23,Quintessential New York pizza that I had growing up here. Not artsy fartsy which is a good thing.
5-Aug-23,"Best Pizza in US, Period. Haven't had a chance to try at the original Koe's Pizzeria in NYC, but don't see how it can be anymore better than the Ann Arbor location..Crust and tomato sauce, divine!!!"
2-Aug-23,"Wow! So glad it has a midtown location now!When I used to live in NYC, I thought Joe's pizza was just okay. Now that I've lived in Boston (and have sampled the pizza scene), oh goodness Joe's Pizza is just far superior!It gets busy because it is a touristy destination. Get your slice here!"
1-Aug-23,A long time customer of Joes's Pizza no more.Pizza was very disappointing and does not live up to the legendary taste or $4 per slice price.Crust was extremely dry and slice was light on cheese.  They don't make fresh pies anymore.  Everything is precooked and recooked upon order. Sadly never coming back.
1-Aug-23,"Was it worth the hype and the 25 minute wait?  Maybe not but the pizza wasn't a total disappointment.  Of the 3 slices we got (cheese, pepperoni, caprese), we liked pepperoni the best and maybe caprese 2nd.  The slices look big but they're thin.  The crust was chewy.  We wished the Coke was colder on the hot day we were there.  The shop was cozy with celebrity photos on the wall, their claim to fame (appearing in Spider-Man) and the staff ran a tight ship, getting customers through quickly."
31-Jul-23,Great food Great service New York Ambience Will come back every time I am in NY. Cheese Pizza
30-Jul-23,"It feels silly to add a review, but on our first trip to New York, we came here, and it lived up to the expectations and the height. The pizza was great; and the very busy staff behind the counter were even better. Joe Pizza is an absolute ""must visit"" in Times Square.The salads were actually very very good as well especially with mozzarella on them. The staff said people rarely ordered them. I recommend it."
29-Jul-23,Super long lines at night to order by slice. I ordered pick up whole pie and walked right in. Pizza was Delicious!!!
29-Jul-23,"Knock, knock, it's me, ummm how do I say this? Was I eating different pizza than everyone else? I am just going to say it, this pizza was mediocre at best. Whew, I did it, I said it, please don't @ me LOL. The hubby and I were excited to try this iconic pizza spot which boasts rave reviews. We arrived in New York around 10pm on Friday, we checked into our hotel, dropped off our bags and walked to Joe's. As expected we were hit with a long line, we were fine with it as we knew there would be one. The line moved along swiftly, we waiting in line for about 20 to 30 minutes. I ordered one cheese and one pepperoni slice and the hubby got one slice of cheese and one supreme slice. The pizza was not bad, it just had nothing going on, it lacked flavor and personality, nothing stood out in the slices, it was just blah and a touch overcooked. The hubby did say his supreme was a little better than the others as it was better cooked. I LOVE pizza, so I was pretty disappointed that these slices weren't better. The hubby and I are looking forward to finding what we think is the best pizza in New York!"
28-Jul-23,"Love Joe's. If you're getting a whole pie, order online and just walk up to the left of the counter at the time they give you."
28-Jul-23,First stop in NYC!   Did not disappoint.  Best pizza ever.  And amazing personable staff!Keep it up guys!
28-Jul-23,"Unpopular opinion!! This establishment has a great history....but the pizza is just mid.  I waited in line for about 15 - 20 minutes.  No complaints, I know what I signed up for.  It was nice seeing all the pics on the wall with the celebrity visitors..  There is minimal seating inside and small area outside where you can stand and eat.  Luckily I found a little stool to sit on.  They had a variety of pizza, but I went with the basic cheese. My thinking is you can't mess up standard cheese and you know when it's good.  It wasn't ""messed up"" per se.  It was just unimpressive.  Next time I'm in NY, I'm going to try another restaurant's and see how it compares.Go for the history, but you're not missing out if you don't stay for the pizza."
26-Jul-23,Someone get me joes number cuz that pizza was scrumptious! Definitely a top 3 pizza place in New York. Here's the thing tho: the line was about a gazillion miles long. A snail could run a marathon before I can order my pizza. If you have ample time and like to chat with New Yorkers on line then this is your place.
25-Jul-23,"This venue is a staple for NY style pizza, it's a small hole in the wall joint with a line that extends far outside the front door during peak eating hours. Just south of Times Square, it was an easy walk from our hotel and made sure to come during off peak hours to avoid any long lines. It was about a five minute wait, but certainly worth it! Went with two slices of classic pepperoni, they have an assembly line working in the back that efficiently gets each order out quickly, even heating up all slices in the oven before handing them out to each customer. Foldable, dripping with oil, and delicious, thank you Joe's for fulfilling my pizza fix!Best,Charlie"
22-Jul-23,"Delivery is fast, efficient. Pizza still fresh out of the oven. Best NY pizza we have ever had. Pepperoni is descent sized and spiced just right. Cheese was stringy gooey. Loved it!"
21-Jul-23,OMG!! I see why this place had a line out the door! The pizza(pie) was so good and hot!! They have limited inside seating and there is a box booth thing where you can sit outside. You can order a specialty pizza but be prepared to wait but it's worth the wait.  I didn't get a chance to snap any pics because I was so hungry and it was so crowded.
21-Jul-23,"The pizza is fye, but you have to get there early. Don't be discouraged by a long line though because they move people fast. However, if you go during busy hours don't bank on being able to sit there or even use a table. Very limited seating."
21-Jul-23,"New York Pizza, thin crust pepperoni topping . Best pizza in midtown New York . Please expect long lines though very popular"
21-Jul-23,"Heard about this place and decided after a comedy show, to try it.  Line out the door but quick and friendly service.  The cashier was adorable and giving Italian lessons.  We ordered a cheese pie, delicious and well worth the wait and the $$$.  Had enough to bring home and have for breakfast this morning!"
20-Jul-23,"Super tasty sauce. Crispy crust!  White pizza and Margarita both excellent slices, fresh toppings"
20-Jul-23,"Line was out the door but moved quickly.  Pizza was fantastic.  We've tried three others in the area and this has been our favorite.  Extra seating outside.  It's nice because they don't price gouge you on drinks.  Pepperoni slice is fantastic, same with Margherita slice.  Everything taste and experience wise you'd expect from a New York pizza place.  A must try when looking for great pizza in NY."
19-Jul-23,"This place is legendary. Obviously popular and very busy constantly- it was seen in Spiderman so you're gonna have a lot of people in line. But- the line goes by extremely fast. These workers are QUICK. The pizza is the very best. My partner has never been to NYC and he became obsessed so quick that we went more than twice for Joe's pizza. There is like 3(?) tables inside, minimal space (its ny..) but theres an outside ledge you can eat at which is under cover and really nice with a view of times square so it's pretty cool. Delicious food and an amazing atmosphere.MUST DO if it's your first time in NYC!"
18-Jul-23,"While in the city with my accelerated academic achievement camp students, we stopped at this popular pizzeria.  There was a short line that moved quickly, and there were limited seating we lucked out and was able to find seating together; thanks to some very kind New Yorkers giving up their seats.  Anywho on to the pizza. The cheese slices were $4 each with others with toppling starting at $5. For Manhattan that would fall under the cheap eats category.  I didn't find the pizza to be that great.  The crust wa stiff and a bit over cooked. The sauce was average and in my opinion could've used more cheese. This place does not hold a candle to Margherita's in Jamaica Queens!"
18-Jul-23,"The pizza was super good, and the staff was super helpful and kind. I would definitely recommend to any tourists or people in the area."
17-Jul-23,"Great food! I definitely see why it's one of the number one pizza spots in NYC. I love think crunch and so this was amazing. The crunch in the freshly warmed crust is truly delightful. I love that this was featured in Spider-Man and the cool photos they have on the walls of all the celebrities that have stopped by! The service was amazing and efficient, and all the workers seemed to be so happy!"
14-Jul-23,"Tldr: solid price for speed and qualityDecided to stop by for a quick slice. They are cash only. Quick service, tasty pizza."
14-Jul-23,"I have been waiting my chance to get some Joe's pizza and finally!!! We flew in late into the city and when we landed I was absolutely starving and really needed some pizza. Our hotel was only a 10 minute walk so we trekked to Joe'sNow, the line was long. We probably waited 10-15 minutes but it was well worth it. We ordered a supreme, white and a veggie slice and wow.... The white was good but the supreme was WAYYYYYYY better. This pizza hit and for $4 a slice this absolutely hits. A New York staple that you can't beat and honestly even better because they are open so late!! 10/10 recommend so definitely if you get the chance go! Plus the whole staff is so nice and happy to help but don't play around when you get up to the counter and be ready to order!"
11-Jul-23,"Joes is a must when in NYC, and with a reason. The pizza, I thought, was perfect. Just 4 simple ingredients but the were to great together. I loved the fresh basil and the flavorful cheese just in the right amount . The dough is perfect and with the right thickness.This is true mastery- it seems so simple yet it is hard to perfect. I know I've never had anything close to this, and will definitely come back for more."
10-Jul-23,"Ordered:Cheese Slice (~$4)White Slice (~$5)Caprese Slice (~$6)Aya's take:Can you believe I was born & raised in NYC and have never had Joe's Pizza!? Until now. I had to prioritize this because whenever I walk by any location, there's a line and I never feel like waiting. Surprisingly, the line moves quick so don't let that deter you. All 3 slices we tried were well-made and if the line out the door wasn't telling enough, you can see all the celebrity photos hung throughout. Out of the 3 slices, the Cheese Slice was the best. It had a good, clean undercarriage and a spot-on ratio of cheese to tomato sauce. The White Slice & Caprese Slice were both good but honestly not super memorable. Definitely get the Cheese Slice when you come to Joe's!"
6-Jul-23,"Ok, we recently made a trip to Manhattan and we wanted to get some pizza, since my wife had not been home in a while she told me to find a good pizza joint, I asked the hotel staff where is the good pizza around here, ""Joe's pizza"" without hesitation. so we looked at the reviews all was great we head off to Joe's to get a slice. the wait was 30 minutes, and I can tell you the pizza was just ok. Everyone instantly starts eating there slices right there on the street and if you know food especially pizza if you eat it hot right out of the oven of course it's good, and most of us is hungry anyway. The moral of the story don't wait in line 30 minutes for pizza that taste like most other pizza joints when you can go somewhere else and get a hot slice and you will think it's the best thing since slice bread."
6-Jul-23,Solid pizza! There was a line but it went pretty quick. Close to Times Square so it will be on the busier side. IG you are looking for New York pizza you found it!
6-Jul-23,Me being from Los Angeles I have tried to find the best pizza and this place is the poster child for New York Pizza. If you have never had New York Pizza this place is good to start and it's a great slice.
4-Jul-23,Walked by this place several times during visit to Times Square.  Noticed their long lines and had to stop and try their pizza.  Was NOT impressed.  Had better at other spots in the city. The wait was not worth it.
4-Jul-23,Place was packed so we ordered Grubhub.  The pies showed up in half the time and was excellent.  Prices are average but great taste and service
3-Jul-23,"Quick, amazing, legendary.  Joe's all day.  Classic NYC pizza joint.  No bullshit, great food. Run don't walk."
2-Jul-23,Solid pizza to eat at 2am in Times Square. Thin and crispy slices offered and quick service despite the long lines. Flavor wasn't anything crazy but it did cure the hunger.
30-Jun-23,"You can't go wrong with Joe's! Even if the line seems daunting, (which it will, especially during touristy seasons,) these guys are pros and will move along quickly. Just be sure to have your order ready once you get to the front! I've always gotten the white pizza because the ricotta is so great, but a i've recently been enjoying the supreme as well."
30-Jun-23,"Consistent, affordable, and good tasting. The definition of a New York slice. Hits the spot late at night."
29-Jun-23,Classic new york Pizza estaishment. The slice never fails. Always consistent. Whether it's a night out after drinking or walking to the train for a quick bite. They are always my go to pizzeria when I'm passing by.
29-Jun-23,There are few Italian pizza places that deserve five stars. This famous pizza place serves $5 slice of pizza in the traditional Naples-Napoli original thin slices with the minimum toppings and served hot and fresh! The customers are fast and furious in eating the cheese pizza smothered in marinara sauce and slightly burnt chewy and hot crust that are too good not to eat the whole thing in a mighty hurry. The multiple places in Manhattan's choicest neighborhoods are so popular that they are expanding to other boroughs and cities. Mukbang Friends find your pizza and enjoy!
26-Jun-23,"A bit of a wait, but worth it if you've got the time! The sauce is very good, and the crust crisp and tasty. I wish there were more options for purchase by the slice and I'd love to see more cheese on the cheese pizza."
26-Jun-23,"This is hands down the best pizza I've ever had. This place is definitely a grab and go type of place. Not a lot of seating inside and some counters outside to stand and enjoy your pizza. Service was super quick. You order your pizza, it goes in the oven for about a min, then when you're done paying it's hot and ready to go. I tried the veggie and caprese which was so flavorful, delicious, and a reasonable and affordable price. Will definitely come back again during my next visit to NY!"
25-Jun-23,Great pizza. Worth the wait plus the line moves quick. These guys know what they are doing and it's shows. Joes is a well oiled pizza machine and their pizza taste great. Open late which is nice
25-Jun-23,Sunday @4pmThis place was PACKED. Line was out the door so I figured pizza must be good. I was absolutely correct!Service was quick even with the amount of customers coming in. Pizza was very thin and very crunchy. I tried their margherita slice and a pepperoni slice. Honestly the margherita was my favorite. You can taste just how FRESH the tomato and the mozzarella is.Place was a little small so there was no place to sit inside but they do have an outdoor area where you can stand and enjoy your pizza.Definitely coming back!!
24-Jun-23,The food was very good very cheesy and sweat. The service was good but the only problem was that it was down the block.If they expand business it would be great put very good.The ambiance was not so great the only reason it's four stars still is the pizza was amazing but it was noisy people were yelling you couldn't sit down so that's my review.
24-Jun-23,"The food is great, but one worker made several rude comments to me about how since I'm Hispanic and from Guatemala. I should know Spanish and mocked me for not knowing how to speak Spanish.I was adopted at 3 and struggled with learning both languages at the same time. This honestly ruined my experience because I've never seen such racial discrimination against a person of the same color and ethnical background."
23-Jun-23,"- extremely friendly service! The cashier was so nice both times that we visited - excellent pizza. Thin sliced, perfectly cooked. Highly recommend the mozzarella- the lines moved very quickly - we were almost out to the streetlight curb and it took about 30 minutes to move through the line"
23-Jun-23,4 ate pizza for $27. Huge slices - fresh - can see it all happen and being made. Line way out the door so we knew. Great pizza! See the pictures!!
22-Jun-23,"BEST PIZZA EVERif you're ever in New York City, you must go here! Before Joe's pizza, the best pizza I've ever had was from Sicily. Joe's completely beats any pizza I've ever had. Joe's was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is from New York. During my getaway with my sweetheart, we went to all of the upscale, $$$$, trendy restaurants. On the last day, I realized we still haven't had pizza. Looking at my recommendation list, I came by Joe's and was happy to know it was super close to our hotel. Hubby and I came here around 11:30 and there was barely any line. I had a slice of their Caprese and my husband had cheese without tomato sauce. What did we think? Well... we came right back for our final meal of the trip before heading to the airport. I kid you not, it was that amazing. Super crispy and thin, yet not soggy. How?! Fresh tomatoes all over the pizza and not soggy. Service was great and quick. Second time around, we had to wait in a line that looked pretty long but they work fast. Quick ten minutes - it's worth it. It was packed inside so we ate outside in their parklet. Nothing fancy, but a view of time square and New York City's craziness = a great time!"
22-Jun-23,We were visiting NYC and this was one stop my husband wanted to go to because of the Spider-Man movie so we made sure to stop by. Man we love and hate this place because now any pizza tastes horrible. Joe's pizza is so amazingly good we cannot get enough of it. The produce is so fresh and the crust is just thin enough to pack a real good crunch. This is our #1 stop now whenever we make a trip to the big apple. Our favorite is the mozzarella pizza and the caprese pizza. Thank you Joefor making the best pizza on the planet!
20-Jun-23,"Pizza is elite, one of the best pizzas I've had in new york and my life. if you go to NEW YORK, you have to to stop by for at least 1 SLICE!!"
19-Jun-23,"On my first ""Foodie vacation"" to NYC I made a list of places that I had to try. Joes was on the list. The restaurant was super busy but they are efficient in keeping the line moving. I had high expectations for NY pizza and Joe's didn't disappoint but they also didn't exceed my expectations. The pizza is quintessential NY style; large thin slices. The pizza was good, nothing more. I came, I saw, I ate. Meh"
19-Jun-23,99 cents pizza has a better crust than Joe's. And way cheaper. It's popular so it's still worth a try though
18-Jun-23,"Joe's is not your ""gourmet"" or ""artisan"" pizzas. They're your good old pizzas with a thin crust and sauce that is light, tomatoey, and sweet. If you are lucky to get a slice or two right out of the oven it's even better. This is hands down my favorite place to get a New York Slice."
17-Jun-23,This is very very good by-the-slice pizza. The space is small but the line moves quickly. The crust is excellent. Yes it's touristy but for a good reason. Service is efficient. You might have to fight your way to a ledge to get pepper flake and oregano.
15-Jun-23,Great NY style pizza! For some reason I liked the plain cheese one the best. Of course their pizza is already famous and there is a line outside the store but it moves fast!
15-Jun-23,"I was walking around the area. I was staying at the Westin and got turned around and a bit lost. Then I see a long line of people here. Well I was hungry and joined the crowd to get a slice. The long was super long, but it does move quite quickly. There is limited seating, standing area inside, but there are some places to stand outside. When my turn came, they had run out of pepperoni pizza, so I got the mushroom, pepperoni, and onion pizza. The to go boxes ran out when I got to the front and I was given a slice of pizza on a plate in a paperbag. I was fine with that. I found a tiny area outside to eat my pizza. The corner I was had some mosquitos, so I was swatting them and eating my pizza as quickly as possible. The pizza was OK. The toppings were good, but it really need red pepper flakes. The crust was a bit too charred and crunchier than I like."
12-Jun-23,"great for a late night slice!! not too expensive as far as times square prices go, and the staff was very nice."
12-Jun-23,"Amazing! I loved even more when I found out they were from Spider-Man. Although I don't like thin crust pizza I absolutely loved the crust, taste, it was the almost perfect crunch I didn't know I needed!"
12-Jun-23,"Had to visit the famous Joe's pizza to grab a slice while visiting the city. Did not disappoint! Even with a small line, it went very quick. Pizza was delicious!"
12-Jun-23,"When you ask for pizza recommendations in NY, 9 times out of 10, Joe's will be on the list of recs. I missed my train and had an hour to kill, so I decided to grab a quick bite before heading out. The line was quite long, but moved surprisingly quickly. The menu is pretty basic, and there aren't TOO many options but just enough to make sure everyone is satisfied.There was a family in front of us that took a little bit of time to order, and even though it was crazy busy, the staff were all kind and patient with them. I opted for a slice of caprese because the tomatoes and mozzarella just looked so fresh. The slice looks gigantic, but because it's thin it wasn't as heavy as I thought it was going to be (or maybe I'm just looking for an excuse to get another slice next time...). I loved all the tomatoes and it was a perfect balance of mozzarella and basil. I was also eying the Supreme, but that will have to wait until next time. They accept credit card so it's convenient to pay. I'm not sure that this was necessarily life-changing pizza, but I think it's worth braving the long lines which move quickly anyway. If you're lucky you might be able to snag a stool to sit on to eat, but standing in the outdoor area did the trick for a quick bite!"
11-Jun-23,"Best pizza we had in NY. Tried a bunch of the street spots and they couldn't hold up to Joe's. Wish the line was shorter, but it's worth the wait!"
10-Jun-23,Long line that moves fast. Firm thin crust that doesn't get soggy. Honestly what more can you ask for? This place lives up to the hype
10-Jun-23,3.5/5! There was a long line but it moved decently quickly. I got the spinach pizza and I'm not sure if it was just that slice but the spinach pieces were more dry than I expected. I liked the thickness of the slice though and the overall taste was pretty solid!
8-Jun-23,"I was in NYC for my sister's med school graduation and we went out HARD after. I think I was acting as though I was the one that just graduated and became a doctor. I couldn't believe how hard these new Docs were partying. In fact, it was concerning. Shots, drunk. I became a goblin that night. My wife yelled at me. Anyways, I woke up soaking wet and crying. Worst hangover in my LIFE. Luckily my sister had ordered Joe's pizza the night before. My wife told me have a few bites and it might help you throw up. Had a couple bites and threw the crust across the hotel room. I vomited, 3 good chucks. Went back to bed. 5 stars"
8-Jun-23,Went to nyc for the first time and wanted a good pizza place so I went for this one bcuz it was close and it was really good I recommend it for quick and fast food but still fire food!
8-Jun-23,"GO to say you've been :) Service was good! We ordered two large ""pies"" Glad we went but the pizza was just OK...pepperoni pizza was a bit too salty but the kids loved the sausage and onion one. But again I'm glad we went!"
7-Jun-23,"NY pizza has officially become my favorite type of pizza after visiting Joe's! We visited their location by Times Square, lines were long and moved fairly slowly. Service here was great! The cashier especially was nice and friendly, we thought it was funny that he was trying to guess where customers were from. He got our home state mostly right and the conversation gave us a little laugh which lightened the mood after how hungry we became when waiting. The place seems very popular by tourists, locals, and celebrities as seen on the various photos showcased on their walls.In summary: the supreme/meat combination pizzas were amazing! Cheese is such a classic. The spinach one was a hard pass from me because I kept getting blobs of spinach each time I bit into the pizza. The crust is fantastic - thin and crispy on the bottom!It's definitely a must visit if you're in NYC :)"
6-Jun-23,"Joe's pizza was recommended by some friends for our NYC trip. I also did some research and I found this specific location to be highly suggested by reviews. I was a big skeptical before going to NYC for my first time on just what exactly the difference was between the NYC style pizza I had in VA and in actual NYC. On my first day in NYC I stopped by here for dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. The line was lonnng, but it went by fairly quick. You can either buy by the pie or slice. The cheese slice was around $4 and depending on toppings or specialty it can go put to $6. I opted for the pepperoni slice. After you order they heat the pizza in their oven. There was ample seating. Although it's busy, the clientele moves in and out at a fast pace. The pizza had a distinguishable smoked and crispy crust. I think overall the crust was the true difference between 'pizza' and NYC pizza. It was delicious. We stopped by again to another Joe's pizza establishment later that nice and it was just as good. Joe's pizza is a good, affordable, and tasty experience!"
3-Jun-23,"This is definitely the most touristy Joe's location I've been to (which is hardly surprising considering it's in Times Square). That said, we waited about 15 minutes in line for our slices. The supreme slice was really flavorful, although the cheese slice left a little to be desired. The cashier was super friendly! Overall, there's a reason why Joe's is so popular -- it's a classic that's reliably good."
2-Jun-23,It was just okay. Not what I expected. Don't let the line intimidate you. It moves fast! There's seating around outside if you can't get any inside!
1-Jun-23,The pizza is delicious. There is usually a line but they are efficient. The pizza is fresh and impressive ! I love the photos on the wall and character this place has.
1-Jun-23,"Classic NYC pizza, yummy, consistent, never disappoints. They have a good system, line is fast.We like it simple, pepperoni or cheese. From L.A., California we never leave NYC without visiting Joe's!"
31-May-23,"One of the best pizzas I've had. It's light and crispy, not oily and heavy. Feels like a thin crust pizza, but just better. My favorite was the margarita, but I honestly want to try a bite of all of them. It can get pretty busy at times, and seating could be hard. But it's worth the wait!"
30-May-23,"This place is all hype, pizza was bleh. Not worth the wait on the line. Tried 3 different toppings and style and none of them were it."
30-May-23,"This was our first time visiting the city. This place did not disappoint. I was on the hunt for a good slice of NYC pizza and all the research I did they all recommended joes pizza. We were on our way to Times Square so this was the closest one. This place gave an old fashioned NYC vibe and the line was out the door, so you know it was good pizza. All the employees were so nice and happy to serve you. The vibe from the customers were amazing. Everyone was happy to be waiting in line for a slice of pizza. It was a smaller restaurant compared to the line of people but it was worth it. The pizza had a perfect crust and the taste was great! I'd definitely come back when I visit the city again."
28-May-23,"Solid NY slice. Go out of your way to get to Joe's. Great crust, perfect char. Totally  authentic."
28-May-23,"We flew in to New York City rather late on a Friday night. Joe's Pizza just happened to be about a 10-minute walk from our hotel (and from Times Square). Despite it being past midnight, we decided to head on over and check it on out. (+) Large and tasty slices! Decided to enjoy some cheese, pepperoni, and supreme slices. All were large in size and deee-licious!(+) There was a monster line when we got there, but it moved quickly. After a roughly 10-15-minute wait, we were able to get our pizza! Not too bad considering the line. Plus, the guys working the counter were very friendly and engaging. I was chatting with one of the guys at the counter and he gave me a free slice just for the heck of it! (+) Considering you are a stone's throw from Times Square, prices were very reasonable. A great snack at 1 am when you're in or around Times Square!(-) No real places to sit down and eat for most. We grabbed a chunk of real estate (painted wooden countertop) in the area on the sidewalk and got our grub on. I did feel like I was getting an authentic NY pizza eating experience though! lol It would have been nice to be able to sit down and enjoy this delicious pizza. If you're in the area, especially late at night, I can't recommend Joe's Pizza enough! Large, tasty slices at reasonable prices! You can't go wrong here at Joe's!4 solid stars."
28-May-23,"Joe's Pizza New York is one of the most recognized pizzerias in the city and has a reputation for serving some of the best pizza around. However, my recent visit left me feeling a bit underwhelmed.Don't get me wrong, the pizza was good. The crust was thin, crispy, and nicely charred, and the sauce was flavorful and tangy. But, for all the hype surrounding Joe's, I was expecting something extraordinary, something that would knock my socks off.Perhaps my expectations were too high or maybe I caught them on an off day, but overall, I have to say the experience was just okay. The pizza was good, but it didn't quite live up to the hype.That being said, I have to give kudos to the staff. They were friendly, efficient, and accommodating. The ambiance and vibe of the place were spot on, and clearly, Joe's has a loyal following of fans who swear by their pies.If you're in the mood for pizza and in the neighborhood, it's definitely worth stopping by Joe's Pizza, but don't expect to be blown away. It's good pizza, but not necessarily the best."
26-May-23,Have no idea how this place has the rating they do.  I've had a lot of Pizza in NYC and this one is not that great imo.
26-May-23,"Line looked long but the service was really quick and efficient. Please know your order and be ready, they move fast. Pizza is very solid, not the best pizza ever but for street and fast pizza it hits the spot. White pizza is amazing."
25-May-23,"Best New York pizza that I've had! The cheese was so fresh and delicious on the spinach pizza slice I had. We went on the first day we were in NYC and we kept wanting to go back, but had too many other things on the agenda. We will definitely go back to Joe's next time!"
23-May-23,"Fantastic pizza that was crispy underneath and on the crust. The pepperoni was my favorite, the cheese was stringy and the sauce was perfectly balanced.The line does get a little long, we also placed an order online and they said they didn't start making it until we arrived. Had to wait an extra 20 min for it to be ready"
21-May-23,"OMG, OMG, OMG!!!  We found it!  We found the best pizza, ever!!  Plan to spend some time in line to get the best slice on the planet. Locals said get a plain cheese. I did and that was where it was atttttt!  We also tried the spinach with white sauce. That was not my jam. Go, wait in line, and enjoy your slice!  It's so good, some random guy walked by and pulled a half eaten slice out of the garbage and casually ate it as he strolled away."
21-May-23,The Sicilian pizza was dry and the dough was not as dense as I am used to. I felt like the line was and wait were not worth it. I have had much better pizza in many other NY locations.
21-May-23,"When I visited New York, I knew I wanted ahthentic New York style pizza, and this place certainly delivers! Even if the line is long, do not worry, it goes quick. All pizza is quickly placed back into the oven when ordered to warm up, which assures the pizza tastes even fresher. All three pizza slices we got were delicious! (Caprese, Supreme, Pepperoni). You can really tell the ingredients are fresh and taste unique. I recommend this place to everyone who wants a nice, big authentic slice of pizza (plus, this place appeared on the best movie ever, Spider-man)."
20-May-23,"After watching Book of Mormon, we were looking for a place to grab a quick bite without a reservation. Pizza is a must in NYC and I've been told that Joe's is the quintessential NY style pizza that I must try. Good thing is there's a lot of Joe's pizza location throughout NY. Bad thing is this one seems to always have a very long line out the door and around the block. We sucked it up and waited in line, and it turned out to only be about 20 mins, so it's not bad!!  Cheese slice is $4, one-topping slices are $5. The guy behind the counter is very efficient in taking your order, sticking it in the oven, and getting the line moving. Know what you want once you get there! There are also some seats inside and on the patio where people can stand. We got a pepperoni slice, and I really enjoyed it. The cheese is salty, dough is chewy. Did it blow me away? Not really, but I did really enjoy it. I don't know if I would wait in a long line to get it again unless I'm here with someone else who also wants it. If you're folding the pizza to eat, Be careful about the oil that drips from the crust side of the slice! I made a mess, clearly I'm not a New Yorker."
19-May-23,"The line is for sure long, but you will be rewarded when you get those giant slices for whats probably the cheapest lunch in NYC. I had a cheese slice and a bite of the white pizza. I definitely preferred the cheese, I think the white could have been perfect if I had some fresh rosemary and/or caramelized onion to put on top - it needed something as it was slightly too bland. The crust though - perfection!Small place, huge line, but no worries it goes super fast and if you are lucky enough to grab a section of counter to eat at you can be in and out in like 40 minutes. It's worth the wait!"
19-May-23,"Good, thin, crispy pizza! Would definitely be a regular customer if I lived in NYC. People are very nice too"
15-May-23,"Visiting from Austin, TX... yes it was good, I've had better and or similar. Line wasn't too bad when arriving on a Friday around 4 PM. It took 15 minutes to get through. A decent amount of options if ordering by the slice. Ordered the supreme to try something different. Everything had flavor but the crust was board-line brunt and hard to chew. Plenty of room to stand inside or outside in a covered area. Inside had a couple of tables and chairs but it's hard to grab being how busy it is. The prices are pretty reasonable for the size of pizza you get. Recommend two slices a person if you like pizza and is hungry, 1 will not be enough."
15-May-23,"Came here tonight for dinner after flying in from CA. First off, don't be deterred by the long line. It moves fairly quickly. Despite the workers' speed, take your time ordering. Don't feel rushed. A lot of foreigners are here so they have a harder time ordering in the first place. The workers will wait despite what it seems. That said, first time for me having proper New York style pizza and it didn't disappoint. I love the thin crust way more so than California's thick crust pizza. I got a slice of the supreme and a slice of pepperoni while my boyfriend got one slice of supreme and a slice of fresh mozzarella. While the pizza is already made beforehand, when you order, they will toss it into the oven to heat it up fresh. It's really nice. Just be careful because it comes out hot so you can burn yourself if eating too fast. The pizza crust is however a bit crispy so you can't really do the proper ""New York"" fold for the pizza. Still doable but it's hard to have it folded all the way to the tip. The restaurant space however, doesn't have much seating inside or outside. But there's a lot of standing table space. If you care for it, there are also tables outside towards the street meant for Time Square's outdoor seating. For authentic New York style pizza, this is a good start. Don't know whether I would come back necessarily since I would also like to try other places. But it's pretty good."
14-May-23,"Very long line but moved fast. Pizza was decent but limited choices. There are like 7 slices to choose from? Not sure if would consider this the best pizza in NY. I like more spice and flavor on my pizza. The slices were plain but good. Overall, good but I wouldn't come back."
14-May-23,First stop was to get a slice....or 2 of NY style pizza! Joes was the fix. Nice crispy bottom and soft top! Will be back.
14-May-23,"The place closes at 3am I believe which is cool if you are on the go at the wee hours. Pizza was so good. The thin crust, cheese and sauce combined for an awesome slice of pizza"
13-May-23,"I'm from Spokane, WA. I was visiting a friend who lives in New York. I've always heard that when you visit NY that you have to get. NY slice of pizza. Me and my buddy walked past Joe's Pizza and saw a line out the door. I figured that was a good sign. The line went through really fast and I got a slice of their pepperoni pizza. It was absolutely amazing. The entire slice was perfection. It was exactly everything I wanted and was expecting from a New York slice. It was perfectly crispy all the way through. Super simple but absolutely delicious. Thank you Joe's Pizza for giving me that experience. Anyone of my friends who goes to New York, I will definitely recommend Joe's Pizza. And when I come back to visit I will make sure that Joe's is one of the first places I stop."
11-May-23,best pizza of mah lyfeeee!!!! joe slays every slice. i felt like toby maguire sitting in a pizza shop
9-May-23,It's the best pizza in new York had it really enjoyed that slice can't wait too go back and try something new
8-May-23,"The pizza hits every-time, especially after a night out! $5 a slice. Pepperoni is the best. There's 5 locations in town so your bound to run into a couple!"
6-May-23,Service was great and pizza was yummy! Line can be long and it moves slow so if you're not willing to wait you can probably find pizza just as good elsewhere. Would get it again!
6-May-23,"This is the quintessential NY slice of pizza. Thin crust, lots of the pepperoni and the cheesiest cheese! Despite how busy this place was, the service was quick and friendly"
3-May-23,Staff was amazing and the pizza was crispy and flavorful. It is definitely worth waiting in line for.
2-May-23,"I was born in NY, but left when I was 8 and only have made rare returns, last time 30 years ago. When I was visiting for a few days, I wanted to get some good 'ol NY pizza! The first place I tried was not that great. Apparently, the idea of traditional ""NY Pizza"" has changed in my absence. My idea of ""NY pizza"", is gooey, cheesy, pizza that flops over when you pick it up, requiring you to fold the pizza up to eat it. When on a paper plate, that plate should be translucent by the time you're done. These days, from what I learned, everyone now likes crispy pizza crust. Not the pizza I remember. Well, the first place I tried lived up to the crispy crust, so I guess it's what everyone in NY wants these days, but not me! After doing some more research, I found Joe's online, and it appeared to be everything I was looking for. On my last day before leaving, I had just enough time to stop by. As other reviews state, there's a line, but it moves quick. Besides, a line means it's good! Fortunately, at 1130am on a Thursday, it took only about 15 minutes to get my slices, and I was lucky enough to snag a seat inside, as I noticed many eating out on the sidewalk. Perfect NY pizza IMO! Just what I was looking for! Greasy, but not queasy, perfect cheese and crust. So glad I found this place before I left NY!"
1-May-23,"Huge with an abundance of toppings, the Caprese and Supreme slices were super filling. I liked how clean and light the tomato sauce was, and appreciated how quick and accurate the service was. The crust was a little tough to chew, but other than that, the slices were delicious.Also, seeing the picture of J.Cole stopping by this establishment was another highlight of stopping by this place."
1-May-23,"Best pizza I've ever had! I highly recommend stopping by this amazing place if you're in town. Hell, even if you aren't in town, make a trip to this place and go out of your way."
30-Apr-23,Always good!  We were thrilled that our hotel is 5 mins from Joe's Pizza. Staff were as always friendly and there was no queue when we got there early!
30-Apr-23,"Unfortunately, the restaurant that everyone claims has the tastiest pizza was greatly exaggerated. It's advisable to order online and pick up if you want a complete pie because the wait time is almost usually very long. I had to season the pizza with a variety of their available seasonings because it was flavorless; nonetheless, I personally like pizza with sauce that has flavor. Although the crust was tasty, it was very floppy and did not hold together. In comparison to other locations in the area, this is also pricier."
30-Apr-23,"All I wanted this visit was NY pizza by the slice. Joe's was so good, we ate there 3 times in four days. Tried some other place but it couldn't compare. This is real NY pizza! When there's a line at 1:30am on a Wednesday, you know it's the place to be."
29-Apr-23,"I didn't quite get what was so special about this pizza. It's a regular oily pizza you can get anywhere , plus, even during Covid when I visited it in 2021 it didn't have any clean environment. It was pretty dirty and overcrowded . Sorry everyone, but I can't really recommend this place  ‚Äç Service was ok I guess but there was a wait."
27-Apr-23,Solid pizza but nothing crazy. It was good but I definitely feel like there are cheaper and better options in NY.
26-Apr-23,"FOOD 4/5This place serves classic new york pie beautifully! Out of our three super large slices, we enjoyed the pepperoni and supreme, but wouldn't really order the caprese again (mozz was good but it was basically just a fresh salad on a pizza slice ) SERVICE 4/5Although the long line went out the door, we felt like it went by pretty quick, and once you get inside you can tell that the folks behind the counter were moving as fast as they could to serve all the hungry customers! AMBIANCE 4/5Loved the small but vintage pizza shop vibes here and all the wall decor (signs/pics) really makes you feel like you're eating at the best place in town! There wasn't a lot of seating though, so most people ate while standing outside or just took it to go."
26-Apr-23,"Always a stop when visiting Savanna, Ga. Located at Market Square, they only take cash but have a ATM on the premises. Tiny place with lots of pizza goodness!"
25-Apr-23,"Disgusting people work in this pizzeria, they are rude, they insult you, they don't care about their customers We waited for our pizza for an hour when the place was empty. Do not waste your time and do not spoil your mood communicating with the staff."
25-Apr-23,"Noticed this famous small pizza place while walking in west village. The line was out the door! Once we realized it was cash only, we had to continue on our journey.Later that night, we ordered a whole cheese pizza to our hotel. It made it still warm and ready to eat! Perfect thin crust, just the right amount of sauce that taste like it was made from scratch, and cheesy goodness! The slices were huge too. Overall, bomb pizza! If you are near and have time, please try and don't forget CASH ONLY!"
24-Apr-23,Pizza doesn't have much flavor to it. Service wasn't the best as they rapidly try to get to the next person in-line. Restaurant is a bit crowded and trash is all over the place.
24-Apr-23,"Blah. Close to Times Square so sucks in the tourists. Long, slow moving line. Pizza is just so-so. Way too many great pizzas in town to waste time on this line. Crust is flimsy and a tad rubbery and the sauce is completely devoid of flavor. No idea how it gets so many good reviews. Guessnifnit is the only NY pizza you ever had you might think it is great. I don't."
23-Apr-23,In my opinion this pizza joint is overrated. I think there are better pizza spots in New York. Flavors were lacking and nothing special about the pizza in my opinion. I think this place is overhyped. There was a long line when we came on a Monday night. The place is very chaotic too as there's so many tourists.
23-Apr-23,"Best pizza I've had? In the states - yes. There was a line out the door and down the street but it moved really quick. The service was great. The pizza-absolutely delicious. The white was my favorite as it had delicious flavor and quality of cheese! The caprese had a ton of tomatoes and was delicious with the mozzarella, basil, and seasonings. The pepperoni was delicious. The pepperonis were crispy! I loved this pizza!! We will definitely be back! This is so worth it!"
20-Apr-23,"This was my first foodie stop on my NYC trip, with high expectations, as I heard so many things about having to try a new york slice. The place was quite small, with a short line that extended out the front door. They had a few seating options inside and a little outdoor sitting area. Both were full. They had lots of different pizza on display with no names for any of them. The prices ranged from 4.50 to 5.50 a slice so I decided to go with the Scilian, not really knowing what it has on it. My boyfriend got the classic pepperoni. Once we got our pizza, we managed to catch a seat outside. The crust was super thin and had a nice crunch to it. The Scilian had tomato slices, mozerella, and basil. I thought mine was delicious, a bit muted in flavour but I appreciate the simplicity. Overall, the best thing was that it didn't feel heavy. Most pizza slices would leave my feeling bloated and oily afterwards, but not Joe's pizza. I was sad we didn't have time to stop by a second time but I highly recommend."
19-Apr-23,"Wait time wasn't bad and pizza did have good flavor. Just not used to a place with small sitting area, but that's my preference.  Pizza was hot and bread was crispy. They have the pizza pre-made and reheat it."
17-Apr-23,"MOLDY MOZZARELLA CHEESE! I have been here 7 times and loved it UNTIL today, I got a slice of caprese and there was clearly mold on the mozzarella cheese. I was so disappointed. I was nervous to eat my other slice which was the fresh mozzarella pizza. Please be sure to check your pizza for mold before you eat it!! Other than that, I still like this place for their oven-baked pizza. I've had the supreme, fresh mozzarella, caprese, and cheese pizza and they are usually all really good, except for when there is mold."
16-Apr-23,Really great tasting pizza ! And quick turnaroundBut it's always crowded and we went on a Saturday night !
14-Apr-23,The children said the pizza was the best they have ever had! We ordered 3 pepperoni slices and one spinach slice and they were all wonderful. Be prepared to have a wait and eat standing. The service was pretty quick.
14-Apr-23,Classic New York pizza. Thin crust with a nice crunch. There was a line at the door but it wasn't a long wait at all.
14-Apr-23,Fast and efficient service for a slice just off of time square.  Do NOT travel to go here. No different than most other places.  Our experience probably was influenced by the efficiency.  Tried other places which had a a poorer experience in food ordering we rated fewer stars.  Summary prices very economical (3 slices $12 ). Waited in line about 8 mi minutes.  Slices placed in oven and removed warm.Was here around 5pm on a Wednesday.
11-Apr-23,"Very good pizza, with good variety (spinach with garlic, or sausage with red onions and mushrooms, anyone?) at a great prize! The only problem is the line is always long. We actually came here twice, but left the first time because we couldn't wait. When we came the second time, we were prepared and it was worth the wait. We inhaled the slices so quickly that we completely forgot to take a pic of them! But suffice to say, it was one of the best pizzas we've had in NYC and lives up to its name. I thought the spinach one was a little overpowering and garlicky but definitely fresh and unique!"
11-Apr-23,"Awesome place to grab a slice of pizza with great thin crust pizza friendly fast service and open til 3am! We came by here at 150am and there were plenty of other customers already ahead of us! My personal favorite is their ""White"" slice but all of their offerings are crunchy but not overly so  and chewy just enough too! Toppings and everything are just what ya need. Yes they take credit cards no problem as well. This is our midnight default whenever we are in the area!$5/slice for the regular ""white"" Get some!"
11-Apr-23,"Don't listen to the ""Meh"" reviews! I'm Italian from NY and I had the plain cheese pizza twice in one week and it was some of the best pizza I've ever had!! The crust was soft on the inside and the perfect amount of crunchy on the outside. The cheese and the sauce melted together perfectly to make that semi orange color that all good NY pizza should do! (If your cheese and sauce are completely separated, trust me, it's not real NY style pizza!) I can't wait to go back next time I'm in the city! The line is always out the door, but it moves super quick, never more than five minutes! Go get a slice, you wont be disappointed!"
10-Apr-23,"White pizza, caprese, pepperoni all on point. Spinach had a little too much but still good. White pizza was our fav!"
8-Apr-23,"When in NYC, you just have to eat pizza. On our way to a local pizza competitor which we've had years before, we saw the line for Joe's Pizza winding up the sidewalk.  My son said it's the best pizza in Michigan, so we decided to take our place in this somewhat fast moving line. It's takeout only with places to sit inside or out if you're lucky to snag a spot.  We grabbed some slices of fresh Mozzarella and pepperoni.  It was so greasy, we had to dab it with napkins.  It was good, but not great.  I like the fact we can just order slices and it was good enough to eat  NY style. On the run and folded up like a sandwich!"
8-Apr-23,One of my favorite pizza spots in nyc. I love the pepperoni and plain but have also tried the margarita and onion / meat / cheese.  Idk what magic they use but the crust is crispy / crunchy and the cheese is melted / gooey. Definitely a hard combination to achieve since the cheese should technically make the crust soggy but it doesn't. I love this place
8-Apr-23,Pizza was delicious! There is no place to sit down to enjoy your pizza.  Prices are accessible and service is excellent.
7-Apr-23,"Recommended by many, it was really amazing.  Have to get the garlic knots--cheesy and delicious.  Then kept it simple with a small pepperoni pizza.  All were amazing. Service was great and the atmosphere was really cool.  Will definitely be going back for repeat that order!!"
7-Apr-23,Ordered delivery on yelp from joes. Joe's had their own delivery folks deliver the pizzas. Food arrived hot. I wasn't sure how much to order so we ordered two large single item pizzas. Their slices are huge and very filling. We also got the family size salad. One pizza was pepperoni and the other was mushroom. The pepperoni pizza was good however it was kind of light on flavors. The pepperonis did not impart a lot of flavor to the pizza. The sauce was mild. The crust did not have a woodfire flavor that I like. Gelso and grand had the woodfire taste.  Will continue the search
7-Apr-23,"Cheap and so good! I prefer Neapolitan pizza, but this delish! Great crust and fresh. There's always a lime but it goes quick!"
7-Apr-23,"Was it good? Yes. Was it worth the long line? Not quite. I've had Joe's 2x two different occasions 2 different locations. Both time U was content with the idea of having real NY pizza. If you have time to travel outside of touristy areas you might find some really amazing pizza. Joe's is the most popular so I can understand why it's always so crowded. If in the city try it and judge for yourself. Venture out you'll be pleasantly surprised. This place was very fast moving, very crowded. Take your Zen with you."
7-Apr-23,"My favorite pizza spot in NY! It's delicious, quick and my goodness super delicious! I love their classic pepperoni; sometimes they overlook the crust but you can ask them to remove it sooner so the crust doesn't burn! They usually have a line, but wait isn't terrible. It goes by quick. The place is usually packed! But it's awesome and worth it! They move quick, so the line moves quick. If eating inside the place while million other people are around you doesn't sound appealing, they have outdoors furniture right next to the cool art sculpture (near CVS) and those chairs/ seating area is pretty clean. Highly recommend this spot as it's delicious if you are into good pizza"
6-Apr-23,Delicious pizza. The supreme was much better than the veggie pizza The service was fast even though lines were long. You gotta find a spot to squeeze in to eat if you're eating there. Overall a staple and great spot to have real NY pizza.
6-Apr-23,"FAVE. NYC. PIZZA. HANDS DOWNI've had Joe's pizza many times now. The first time I've ever had it was back in 2019, and till this day, this is still my fave pizza in nyc. I've tried a few of the other famous nyc pizza joints (like Prince street, artichoke pizza), but nothing beats this. Can't really explain why their pizza is so good, but it's just the perfect amount of cheese, and juiciness and flavors. I've had the supreme, pepperoni  and they are both so goood. Ambiance:I went to the time square location, and depending on what time and day you come, it can be very crowded."
5-Apr-23,"First time coming here, second time in the city. Besides the zombies on the floor outside the place, line moved fairly quick and my siblings enjoyed this spot more than Prince st pizza. Loved the NYC ambiance and being all tightly packed in a pizza spot. Hard working employees too! I used to work at a pizza spot and even on my most busiest and worst day it wasn't that much of a hard work. Make sure to leave a tip!"
5-Apr-23,Best pizza we've ever had! Ordered multiple times during our trip. Line is long but worth the wait! The service and and staff are very quick and friendly.
4-Apr-23,Jos's Pizza def lives up to the hype! The pizza we got was super hot which definitely enhanced the experience.
4-Apr-23,"This pizza is amazing. Worth the wait for sure. Don't be discouraged when you see the line, it moves quickly."
4-Apr-23,"When you come here, there will likely be a line waiting out the door, but do not let that turn your little impatient craving away. Get in line and get your slice of pizza here! The way this place operates won't have you waiting forever. It's amazing how fast and delicious this establishment is, which is probably why it's so famous. The ambiance is exactly what you would expect from an incredibly busy, crowded and amazing pizza parlor. There are framed pictures all over the walls of famous people who have eaten and been to this pizza restaurant. This is really NY pizza at its best man! From the size of your slice to the cheesy goodness of every bite, this really hit the spot! My youngest son was truly the happiest little boy in NY as he ate his pizza. As soon as we left, he said ""New York has the best pizza in the world!"" The service here was awesome and out of this world you guys, but they move quickly once you get up to the counter, so you need to be ready to order once you're up. They have a whole system that works incredibly well and fast. You can tell it's just something that goes with the job there that separates them from other pizza places in the city! I'm telling you, there's a reason it's called ""The BEST of NY"" and "" The Absolute BEST slice of pizza in NY."" This is not a test. This is not a tourist trap. This a real deal! Go! Go now!"
4-Apr-23,Thin crust pizza that I remembered when I lived here. My sons loved the thin crust cheese and pepperoni. They were able to fold each slice and enjoy it.
3-Apr-23,"All I could say is YUM!  Joe's has a ton of slices options: pepperoni, plain cheese, spinach, white sauce etc., and once ordered they will warm it up fresh. There is a cooler with drinks; pop, and water. The place is small and the long lines move quick. It is worth the wait!  You can take it to go or sit outside or in to enjoy your slice."
2-Apr-23,"I had a terrible experience at this place. They are very unorganized and get the orders mixed up. The person that served me the pizza was very rude and yelled at me when I tried to tell him that 2 slices of pizza was missing from my order. There is nothing extraordinary about the pizza. I felt so disappointed since was my first time trying NY pizza. I'm not going back there, that's for sure."
1-Apr-23,Crispy out and juicy in. Best pizza ever! Always busy. Good experience in New York Time square.
30-Mar-23,"We ordered Joe's Pizza for delivery when we were staying near Times Square last week.  Delivery was prompt, pizza was hot and tasty!  I highly recommend delivery over waiting in a long line."
29-Mar-23,"We were going to walk out because there was no place for us to sit. However, the line moved quickly and we were able to get our pizzas and sit down for a bite. As you can see in my photo, I couldn't wait to take a bite! Super crunchy bottom and flavorful toppings! Restaurant was small and packed the entire time we were there but the employees were super efficient getting people in and out! My suggestion is to get a vending machine so it helps take out drink ordering from the cashier!"
29-Mar-23,The best slice in NYC. Lone line but it moves fast. Highly recommend. Fast affordable and delicious!
29-Mar-23,"Short walk from Times Square. We had to wait in a line for like 30mins but it's well worth the wait! They all were working amazingly hard and fast and it was just brilliant. The pizzas, omg, so good. Crunchy yet still chewy, and tasty. It was my first time trying NY style pizza and I loved it! I'll come back to NY only for their pizza :)"
26-Mar-23,Good taste but little short on the quality.  Either lower the price a bit or add more cheese and increase the slice size.
25-Mar-23,First time in NYC and had to come try a slice from here and was not disappointed at all! Great tasting pizza. Had a short line leading out the front door but didn't wait long at all.
25-Mar-23,Ordered pizza to be delivered and it was cold and chewy. Must of been one of the pizzas sitting around all day. Terrible don't bother with them.
24-Mar-23,Long line but moved very quickly. It was definitely worth the wait. Went there 2 days in a row.
23-Mar-23,When you think famous NY Pizza.. its always Joe's  There's a reason they've been around for so long and always have a line out the door. Line moves pretty quick. Get ready to grab and go fast when it's your turn. Look online for what you wanna order before your up. No dawdling! Seating is a challenge as is most places closer to Times Square. We stood at the benches out front and we did just fine. My kids especially my teenager was completely enamored with the NY feel and the hustle and bustle. Truly a genuine NY experience. I'm so glad I finally got to bring my family to Joe's NY!
22-Mar-23,"We tried a lot of pizza on our trip to New York, but I'd have to say this was the quintessential New York slice. It was cheap and they only serve the classics, no fuss or frills. We were lucky enough to go during their off hours, and my husband somehow slipped right in and was in and out within 10 minutes! The dough was perfectly cooked, chewy and thin, and had so much flavor. The marinara was sweet and tangy, and the cheese is super gooey, everything just tasted really fresh and was executed well. So happy to have tried Joe's!"
22-Mar-23,Great food! Very good flavor. It was hard to find a spot to stand or sit as it was just packed! Service was good and fast!
21-Mar-23,"When in NYC, this is a must. Cheese pizza by the slice is $4 or with a topping is $5. Even heated up later it is still good but if you want to play out your inner John Travolta and do the fold over technique while strutting around the streets of NY, this is the place to grab a slice. Service is quick and efficient."
21-Mar-23,"Delicious New York pizza just a few blocks from our hotel!  There was a line formed outside of the restaurant but it moved fairly quick. There isn't a lot of seating but we found a spot in the front where we could stand and enjoy the pizza.I had a caprese pizza slice that was delicious. The crust was crispy and thin, the sauce very flavorful, and mozzarella was fresh. My picky little one had a cheese slice and she devoured it!  She wants to go by again tomorrow for another slice!We'll definitely be back!"
20-Mar-23,"A must have slice of pizza this place is already on a top 5 place to eat pizza, service is great you have to be ready to order because of how busy that place get, not much room to eat but the ambience is a great NY experience."
19-Mar-23,Don't let the line outside scare you. It moves quickly and your food is ready and hot instantly! Plenty of seating bc ppl come and go fast!
19-Mar-23,Very good pizza and they deliver late.  I will definitely order from here again.  Also appreciated how fast they delivered our pizza.
19-Mar-23,"My family was in NYC for a quick day trip and this place came highly recommended via tik tok. Located in a very central area. We were serviced fairly quickly. The line was out the door as we walked up. They have several pizza and toppings available. I originally ordered on slice but once I finished I went back for another. Don't plan to eat here. It's more of a quick stop type place. However, there was outdoor and indoor options available and we ate inside. Very small place with good pizza."
19-Mar-23,"Saw Joe's pizza listed on the Infatuation app as ""thin crust royalty"" so stopped here for my NYC pizza craving during a weekend visit. Long lines which did move quickly, celebrity photos adorning the walls to prove the royalty part, very limited standing space. The pizza itself was fine, but I'm not sure I see what the fuss is about - I've liked slices from other places more in New York."
19-Mar-23,"Hard to find a better pie than Joe's! Perfectly sauced! Perfect crust, not too thin, not overcooked, yet still just chewy enough! The toppings are delicious and the onion aren't overcooked, giving the slice a nice crunch of onion flavor! All delivered quickly to our room!"
19-Mar-23,"quintessential NY slicedespite all the hype, this place is actually really good. after eating a ton of doo-doo ""NY"" pizza along the east coast, it was nice to come to a place that does it right. the crust is thin, with just the right amount of crisp/chew, a touch of tomato sauce and cheese. toppings were good - recommend the supreme slice. Sprinkle on your dried spices of choice and fold. down the slices while squeezed into a tiny corner of the counter. Nothing more new york than that.PSA: there is usually a line but don't fret - they move fast."
18-Mar-23,Great pizza to go to get that New York pizza fix! Took it back to the room and it was amazing!!
18-Mar-23,"You want to experience awesome New York pizza, you gotta come to Joe's.  I went to the ""most popular"" pizza spot in Brooklyn and they got nothing on Joe's.  Thin (but not like a cracker) charred (but not burnt) glutinous crust...perfect, not soggy in the middle.  Good sauce, tasty pepperoni, chewy cheese.  Best part was the price---can't be beat for the quality!"
17-Mar-23,"Fast service even when crowded! Pizza was thin and crispy crust! Truly NYC style fast pizza. Sooo delish, and would go again!"
17-Mar-23,"Caprese - 3/5 Fresh mozz 5/5Super thin crust - nice and crispy, flavor was good. Tried the caprese and fresh mozz. Absolutely loved the fresh mozzarella - could not stop thinking about it and even had Joe's two days in a row. Worth the wait (lines move quickly) and I think this is a must-visit destination if you're in the city!"
17-Mar-23,Really enjoyed the caprese pizza. Decent little pizza joint right off time square. Recommend!
16-Mar-23,"It's a shame that i have to write this, because I've always had good experiences with them. I ordered seven pies for a meeting, two days prior. They even contacted me after i placed the order to ensure accuracy. Not only do i not currently have seven pies in hand for a BUSINESS MEETING, I get major attitude from phone guy. We are all overwhelmed, that's not an excuse. They say ""I'll get to the bottom of it""' yet 45 min past delivery time I'm sitting here sans pizza. My group had ordered quite a bit from them in the past, no issue. What will they do to make it right? Probably nothing. Over $200 and you can't send my pies two blocks away. Houston we have a problem.  This was a contract of payment for services rendered. I paid. I still have no pies. I am not recommending this place for catering. There are too many other establishments in the neighborhood."
16-Mar-23,In Times Square. Very busy with long line that moves quickly. There are enough places to stand inside with quick turnover. Pizza is pretty good and not too expensive (see photo of menu). Worthwhile to visit or if you need a quick bite
16-Mar-23,One of the best pizzas in new york city! Best after a late night out. The pizza is delicious and comes out of the oven pipping out.
15-Mar-23,"Perfect pizza to have in NYC! I had this delivered to my hotel via doordash, it was huge! They don't sell by the slice or have any smaller pies. Anyways you see all the great reviews, fantastic pizza."
15-Mar-23,Best pizza I had in my trip to NYC. The line was down the block so instead of waiting we ordered delivery with a 2 hour wait and it was worth it for sure.
14-Mar-23,"Wowee! Pizza was straight yum. On our side side of the counter, the atmosphere was cramped with hungry, ragged hearts, hoping for a slice of classic NY 'za. Few places to sit. On the other side of the counter were 11 or 12 of NY's finest, saucin' up sumthin' special at lightning speed with the enthusiasm of true NY pizza religious fanatics."
14-Mar-23,"Came back to Joe's - I think it's becoming an NYC tradition for me to stop by for a slice. I got the White pizza and I thought it was good, but not mind blowing! I remember my cheese pizza was literally mind blowing, so I was a tad disappointed. The crust was still crispy and delicious - but I think the White lacks a bit in the flavor department. Line still moves super fast - they raised their prices due to inflation! People move in and out, so it shouldn't be too difficult to find a place to sit."
13-Mar-23,"Joe's was on my list of pizza shops to try. I stopped by for lunch during my trip. It was busy when I arrived. There were about 20 people in line. The line does move fast. They have a few pizza options available. You select your amount of slices, and they pop it into the oven to warm up. They put your order in a carryout box if you're not eating there. They give your order on paper plates if you're eating there. There are a few tables available inside to eat. The walls around the tables are covered with celebrity pictures that have visited. There is an outside patio where you can stand and eat; also, two long wooden areas to sit. They have cheese and pepper shakers outside. The pizza slice was big. It was thin and crispy. I expected more veggies on it, but it was delicious just as it was made. The customer service was good. The line moves fast, but the staff doesn't rush you as you're ordering. I would definitely stop by again when I'm in town."
12-Mar-23,"Getting a slice of pizza is must when in New York so we decided to try one of the city's iconic pizza shops. And I'm glad we did. Instead of going downtown, we stopped by their branch in midtown since our hotel was in the area. My first impressions of the place was that it's your typical pizza joint -- nothing special expect maybe for the pictures of famous people on their walls. The place was clean enough, had lots of napkins, condiments, and smelled yummy. Pros: - hot, fresh from the oven- thin, crisp crust - generous toppings- reasonably priced- fast service - tasted wonderful Cons:- carbs if you're not a big fan Why the 4? While their slices were good, we tried other pizza joints which were just slightly better."
11-Mar-23,So we came in from Rhode Island had some lunch at Joes.  Pizza was good they have a good product.   Keep up the good work.   The pictures all over the walls added a nice touch to the ambiance.
10-Mar-23,"3.5/5I think Joe's is definitely a solid choice. We had this after a night out and I have to say it tasted better than when I've had it in the day time. Is this the best pizza in the city? In my opinion there are better ones, but if you're looking for a pretty solid regular slice, with a good white pizza this is your place.  It's less than five dollars a slice and solid thin crust pizza."
6-Mar-23,got the cheese slice and supreme. excellent ny pizza. long line but wait wasn't too bad
5-Mar-23,"Awesome pizza close to Times Square. 1 slice pizza and drink for $8. Friendly service, limited indoor seating and outside standing area."
5-Mar-23,"Good Pizza and lots of options. The service was good also, people there talked on Spanish too! The ambience was nice, lots of pictures of famous people that went to the pizza shop, but the waiting line was loooong. If you have the time and patience, good to go, if not, there's other places you can go haha."
5-Mar-23,"// SummaryA quintessential NY slice that may or may not be worth the hype, but is still a great rep for NY-style pizza.// ExperienceSo I've been told Joe's is one of the top three slices you can get in NYC. If that's the case, then maybe I'm just not much of a NY-style pizza guy. I've ordered maybe 9-10 slices in my couple of trips to NYC, and while they have been consistently good - it hasn't knocked me out of the park. I will say though, that of the NY-style slices, Joe's probably does rightly have one of the top spots in folks' list.// ServicePretty straight-forward, just point to the slices you want, they put it back in the oven, and you're good. No non-sense, and the line goes by relatively quickly.// AmbianceIt's a pretty small shop, but they do love to advertise how many celebs have had Joe's Pizza. // ConvenienceRight near the office, so it was great for me. I've come here a couple of times to get a quick meal and have never been disappointed."
4-Mar-23,4.5 stars as a tourist attraction or?  Pizza is like cardboard and lacks flavor. It is close to wholesale clubs' type of pizza. I really don't understand those 5 stars' reviews. Did they ever have a good pizza? Speechless... It would not hurt if they swept the place more frequently. There are so many places in NYC; please avoid--a tourist trap.
3-Mar-23,"Highly recommend checking out Joe's Pizza for quick service NY style pizza.  They do always have a line out the door, but it moves pretty quick.  Limited amount of dining space but there is a standing area, which it's not bad. Huge slice of pizza that they do warm up in the oven and comes out hot!  Just a nice place to get the pizza craving.  They offer a variety of different types of pizza as well."
2-Mar-23,"Okay, my bad... I didn't get to take a picture of the actual pizza. Can you blame me? It was 1 am and we were starving. With that being said, everyone talks about how GOOD NY pizza is. Pair that with a late night craving after drinks... the last thing you want or expect is to be let down. It's hard to do that with pizza. Unfortunately, It was pretty mediocre to say the least. The flavor was eh. I've had better pizza in Florida."
1-Mar-23,"Joe's is a staple in NYC, and I was skeptical about to try it, but I couldn't left the city without it.. what a surprise, I think I would day dream about this slice for the rest of my life, service is fast so you better make your mind before stepping in the line to order, seating is limited but rotation is fast so you probably would find a corner super fast, this place is how I would describe NY life. You better go!!"
28-Feb-23,I wish I had gone back to Joes for a 3rd time on my trip to NYC  Pizza was too good :) Can't  wait to visit again. Lines long but worth the wait in my opinion. It was close to where we stayed so that was a plus!
26-Feb-23,"LOCATION/SERVICE:Worth the wait and exactly everything we wanted in our trip to New York. Stood in a small line outside; the space inside is very small and only a few tables to sit and eat at. The service was very quick and friendly. The location was small but had a ton of character, and a very warm environment.FOOD: Classic New York pizza and super flavorful. We got the classic pepperoni and the supreme pizza; loved both of them. It was thin crust pizza, greasy, and huge. Overall: when you visit New York make sure Joe's is part of your travel plans. There's ton of great new York pizza spots, but this was the best."
26-Feb-23,"Initially I was a little apprehensive about waiting in the line for pizza, knowing there were tons of other pizza places within walking distance. But it was definitely worth the wait! The pizza was incredible, and was better than any of the other places we had pizza on our trip to NYC."
26-Feb-23,"Classic New York pizza - whether it's cheese ($4) or with pepperoni ($5), this is a great snack during your day. They have a handful of standing tables so you can enjoy your slice while catching up with friends!"
25-Feb-23,"The line was out the door but it moves pretty quickly. Overall, solid slices of pizza. We got the pepperoni and white with spinach and garlic pizzas and they were both good, but due to the hype, I expected a little bit more flavor in each bite."
25-Feb-23,"Absolutely outstanding NYC style pizza! Several locations in the city, luckily wasn't too busy when we went and was able to grab a table. It's popular for a reason and affordable to eat. Definitely will come back!"
23-Feb-23,I love a good NY pizza and I recommend this place! It's so delicious and fresh! I love that they have a wide assortment and is super fresh! In NY I like to get either cheese or pepperoni and this pepperoni pizza was amazing!! It was light and didn't feel heavy or greasy. It's super affordable at $5 a slice. Lines weren't long when I went around 11am. Super quick service and it's sooo yummy!!!!
23-Feb-23,"This place definitely is a tourist hot spot. The line was very long and out the door, but they quickly got through it. We opted for a whole pie - half cheese, half pepperoni and it was piping hot and tasty. When you think of NY style pizza, this is what you imagine. My husband was so happy to finally get his hands on a slice of greasy, cheesy pizza. It definitely lived up to our expectations."
22-Feb-23,"An NYC institution for a reason! We came late on a Friday night but the lines moved quickly and the service was super nice and positive, especially given the number of customers waiting in line. The pizza slices were served piping hot and were nice and crispy. Loved trying the different flavors, my fave was the caprese! Lots of places to perch and eat your slice inside or in the outdoor dining area too."
20-Feb-23,"We waited 30min to try their pizza. Got a plain slice, 2 pepperoni slices, and a Sicilian. In my honest opinion - they were all ok NY pizzas but not really so amazing as I was hoping for with all the hype. I probably won't go back. The tomato sauce is a little on the sweet side which you can taste the most on the plain slice. The crust was crunchy but overall nothing special."
17-Feb-23,"The infamous Joe's Pizza. The first time we tried grabbing a slice there were probably over 75 people waiting in line so we decided dinner time was not the appropriate time to visit this place. We went on a Monday during lunch and there was pretty much no line. We didn't really know what we wanted to it was kind of rushed because they want you in and out so I ended up getting the caprese. It's super thin crust so it was nice and crispy, flavor was good, not great. If you're looking for thin crust pizza with nominal sauce, this is your place. I thought the pizza was just average for the hype it gets. Cool place to visit though and it's right in Times Square so it's a quick bite to grab when walking around."
16-Feb-23,One of the best pizza I have ever had. Spend 4 days in NYC and had Joe's for dinner twice.
16-Feb-23,"3.5/5Solid slice but you definitely pay more for the name and history of Joe's. I get the pepperoni when I have touristing visitors in town, but there is no shortage of great slices for a more local-friendly price tag."
10-Feb-23,"I had a goal to eat NY style pizza by the slice when I was visiting.  We picked the right place!  I ordered the margarita and fresh mozzarella.  Absolutely amazing!  You order from the counter and then they stick it back in the oven for you, so it's piping hot!  Love it, love it, love it!"
8-Feb-23,"Joe's Pizza in New York is a legendary pizzeria with a reputation for serving some of the best pizza in the city. The cheese slice is the standout item on the menu, made with a blend of mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses melted to perfection on top of a crispy, yet chewy crust. The sauce is made with vine-ripened tomatoes and a blend of spices, adding the perfect amount of sweetness and tang to each bite.One of the things that makes Joe's Pizza so special is the simplicity of its menu. The focus is on the pizza, and they do it exceptionally well. However, this also means that the place can get quite crowded, especially during peak hours. Lines can get long, but the wait is always worth it.Joe's Pizza has become an institution in New York, and if you are visiting the city, it's a must-visit destination. People come from all over to try the cheese slice, and the pizzeria has been featured in numerous TV shows, movies, and articles.In conclusion, if you're looking for a classic New York slice, Joe's Pizza is the place to go. With its famous cheese slice, crispy crust, and unbeatable flavor, it's easy to see why this pizzeria has been a staple in the city for so many years. Just be prepared for a crowd and a wait, as this place is a popular destination for locals and tourists alike."
7-Feb-23,"One bite everyone knows the rules. 5.3Overall it was a cool vibe and the line was out the door. If you're looking for quick and fast action this is the place. 100% grab and go. There are seats and tall tables that run along the walls for standing but this place is packed all the time. Best to grab and go. It was normal good pizza but it didn't live up to the hype. It's a cool place for photo as they clearly advertise that it was seen in spider-man. If I was in the area, I'd come back but not worth making a trip just for this."
5-Feb-23,Its a classic. Joes pizza has been hit up by a huge amount of celebrities whose pictures are showcased on the left as you enter. Come ready to enjoy the perfect NYC slice. Lines can be long but they move fast. Definitely worth putting it on your list if you're in the area!
3-Feb-23,"I'm visiting NYC for the first time and I wanted to experience the big hype about pizza. It was a little crowded so we made line, but it was really fast the guy took our order and paid. I have to say service was definitely to the point.My two slices were delicious, not too greasy just perfect, they had cheese and pepper bottle almost everywhere so this was a plus, the flavor was definitely something out of this world. Best pizza I had in my life, wish we had this place in my hometown."
2-Feb-23,"I love Joe's Pizza. There's always people standing outside for it, and there's a reason why! The pizza here is simple but good. The wait is never too long, the staff is efficient, and I am always excited to get my pizza. There's not much space to eat there, but turnover is quick. Would definitely recommend Joe's and would definitely return!"
2-Feb-23,"As advertised this is the place for New York style pizza. The crust has a nice crunch to it, the slice is easy to fold and the cheese is perfect! Seasoned to perfection the whole vibe in here screams BIG CITY ACTION! Definitely recommend dropping in if you're walking around time square. Please tip the crew too, they deserve it, they are working so fast and with precision!"
1-Feb-23,awesome pizza. super fast. incredible environment for the city.  there wasn't enough room for all of us to sit but that doesn't matter here. it was awesome.
31-Jan-23,Best pizza in NYC and I've eaten at plenty of NY pizza spots. Carmine St seams to be the best spot but they're all good.
29-Jan-23,Amazing fresh mozzarella pizza. Fast delivery. I see why it's such a New York city staple!
28-Jan-23,"Wow - amazing pizza- one of the best slices I have ever had. Crispy but chewy, great fresh cheese and sauce, just get cheese or pepperoni. It's worth the wait in line, this place makes masterpieces."
27-Jan-23,Finally got to try this place on my 3rd visit to New York. Landed yesterday evening and took my Uber to the hotel. Changed my clothes and walked directly here.We got the pepperoni slice. Sauce was delicious acidity. Slice was a good large sliced New York style pizza. Pepperoni was ok. I enjoyed it a lot especially being the first New York slice since my last trip about 2-3 years ago but I think I expected that my first slice bites would wow me more. Especially after hearing this was a must try place and I was hungry after the flightI personally enjoy crunchier pepperoni that folds up.  I will be going to some of my other favorite spots and seeing how they compare after the years. If you see a line don't think you'll wait too long the workers are amazing at getting your slice and getting the line going. Super efficient and friendly staff.
26-Jan-23,"Had the classic pepperoni pizza and was not disappointed. Service was quick, and pizza was delicious!"
25-Jan-23,Super busy. Packed like sardines.  We got several types. I like the spinach one bit did not like the thick Squamish pepperoni pizza. Overall. it was good but just like any other pizza places in NYC that's on the cheap side. I find nothing special about it and definitely not worth the hype to be staying in lines packed like sardines
25-Jan-23,Visiting NYC? Joes is a must for that big ol slice of goodness! There's always a line but it moves quick! Stayed in times square and this was a hot spot especially in the evening. Grab a whole pie you don't be disappointed!
25-Jan-23,Best pizza in New York. Had it twice in a 4 day trip. Had it at the location at financial district and time square. Both amazing. I will be craving this pizza for a long time
23-Jan-23,"Joe's doesn't need our recommendation but they get it anyway. For such a busy place the service was fast and friendly and the pizza was delicious. The line was to the door but it moves fast. We got slices of cheese, pepperoni, and Sicilian. Everything's pretty fresh because they're so busy. They had pepper flakes, oregano, and garlic to add if you want. Seating was tight but we managed. And yum. In a city full of great pizza we like Joe's best. (Comparing to Angelo's and Pop's--both of which we liked a lot, but Joe's was just better.)"
22-Jan-23,"Don't be alarmed by the line out the door... it goes fast.These were the best slices we had all weekend! I got the pepperoni and the fresh mozz. So good. What stood out to me was how crispy the bottom was. Sometimes NY slices can be super floppy and messy, but these were perfect.Also fun to see all the celebs on the wall. I see you, Joe Jonas."
19-Jan-23,"One of the best tasting Pizza's we had, while out in NYC. Very easy to call and have delivered to your hotel. The pie was still hot, and tasty even after being delivered in the freezing cold. Call them, you won't regret it."
17-Jan-23,"best delivery some guy came swinging into my apartment and said""pizza time and dropped it off it was DELICOUS 10/10 would recommend to EVERYONE"
16-Jan-23,Wasn't anything crazy or bad? Just tasted like typical NY pizza which is what I think they strive for anyways. I don't think I would've been able to distinguish between here vs. a dollar slice pizza you can get anywhere else
16-Jan-23,Spider-Man at its best! Nom nom nom. Turnover is fast therefore can keep pizza fresh. Thin crust. Cheese and the combo pizza was spot on. Will come back soon.
15-Jan-23,Ordered a half supreme & half pepperoni pizza. They gave me half pepperoni & have cheese. Wth. I called & they said there's nothing they can do about it. I ate one slice & this pizza sucks. The crust was chewy. I would never eat or order here again
15-Jan-23,Overrated and not worth the lines. You eat standing up too. Pizza was dry and plain. We found better pizza in small restaurants around. No restrooms. Service was cordial despite endless lines. No ambiance except pictures of celebrities.
14-Jan-23,"While I've certainly had better pizza, I've also had much worse.Everything is handmade, the tomato sauce is chunky and fresh (a tad too sweet for my taste) and all the slices are hot and crispy when you get them. The service and ambiance are great, too.Overall certainly good Pizza."
14-Jan-23,Better options in the same neighborhood. The pizza was cold. They didn't pop the slice in the oven like other places do before serving. Cash only.
14-Jan-23,"*** 4.5 stars ***There's a lot of debate around Joe's. Is it just a tourist trap, does it live up to the hype, etc. I've had it a few times now and I think it's a solid NYC slice that won't disappoint. There's always a line, but it moves relatively quickly. One time after a broadway show it wrapped around the block and was probably 20- 30 minutes which wasn't ideal given how hungry we were, but I also figured it would take that long to get anywhere else and then there might be a line there."
13-Jan-23,"This pizza is pretty good for the price! I wasn't blown away though. A slice of cheese didn't seem all that different from a 99 cent slice.This location is super crowded usually, but they get through the line pretty quickly."
12-Jan-23,"I'm not sure if I've just had too much pizza in NYC but I found Joe's a bit underwhelming, given all the hype. On a rainy day in January, I had a slice of margherita pizza which was just ok. Overall I felt this was an overhyped pizza place / tourist trap in the Times Square area. I've definitely have had much better (and cheaper) pizza in NYC. Maybe I just went on an off day so I might give it another try, let's see."
12-Jan-23,"Came here after nye around 3am. The wait wasn't long, service was fast. The plain pizza was delicious. Would deff come back."
11-Jan-23,"We were in NYC. We ordered Postmates from Joes Pizza . A half an hour in I checked to see how long it would take for the delivery. No delivery showed up on the app. I checked my email and the order did not show up and not on the app history either. I figured based upon this that the order wasn't placed. I placed another order only to have the first order delivered a few minutes later. When I called Joe's to cancel they said it was too late and the driver was on his way. I called Postmates and they were no help at all. We never actually received the order and we were charged. This is why we stopped using Postmates. We used to order 4 or 5 times a week, now we order from a different place. I called my credit card to dispute. About a month later Joe's randomly charged me AGAIN! This was not because of the dispute. This was totally separate. For the same order in NYC when I wasn't even there. Postmates is the worst and their app is sketchy. Joe's pizza isn't very good and their customer service is bottom of the barrel. Go anywhere else"
11-Jan-23,10/10 recommend. Line was out the door. Pizza was excellent. I'm from Texas and wanted great NY pizza. This place checked that box.
9-Jan-23,"The pizza wasn't hot when I received it, but even when it was warm, I've still had better pizza elsewhere. I wouldn't recommend the spot, but it's definitely quick to order and deliver."
9-Jan-23,"My favorite pizza place in NY! The line may be long but is definitely worth the wait. While waiting you also can enjoy the photographs on the walls of all the celebrities who have visited as well as the news articles on Joe's Pizza. All the slices are big and relatively cheap! My favorite is the fresh mozzarella pizza. The thin crust, red sauce, and mozzarella are so delicious. Definitely recommend trying Joe's Pizza!"
8-Jan-23,"The slice size is pretty big and they heat it up for you so the cheese is nice and melted, although we both agreed that there was more crust than we would've liked. The line moved a lot faster than the last time I was here, but I wouldn't bet on any seating."
7-Jan-23,Decent pizza.  Neat atmosphere.  It's a must try at least once during a New York Visit.
6-Jan-23,"Prepare to stand in line, rub shoulders and order pizza in a no nonsense manner. Nope, no sausage-what you see is what you get. Excellent pepperoni and nicely cooked crusted.  A wonderful slice"
6-Jan-23,Most tasty Pizza in New York. Great place to pick up and eat on the go. Line is usually long but its definitely worth the wait. Its pretty crowded and cramped in there. I would recommend picking up a pizza and taking it back home to watch your favorite sports game with a beer.
6-Jan-23,100% worth the hype. One of the best pizzas I've had. Service is interesting as they're all rude but it's all part of the experience so dont take it personally
5-Jan-23,Good pizza fast free delivery. Little expensive but worth the experience if your in ny for the week or weekend
5-Jan-23,What you expect from an in and out pizza place. The line is pretty quick especially for time square. All standing room. Go in order eat and leave. We checked into our hotel at a weird time and it was too early for dinner so we opted for pizza. Love the thin crust so it wasn't too filling. It was a great quick snack for us! It's a chain so don't just bank on this location. Nothing hits like a greasy pizza on a cold day
5-Jan-23,"Joe's Pizza delivered an outstanding product, service, vibe! Love the nostalgic feel and classic pizza pie. Will return next time I am in the Big Apple!!!"
4-Jan-23,"This was my first trip to NY for my BDay. We were so hungry after we got off the plane and check-intoour hotel. We stayed in Times Square, we wanted to be close to everything. I wanted ""NY PIZZA"" We started walking on TS and saw this place. Instant HIT!! So freaking good. I like thin pizza. It was fresh, hot and delicious! Both my BF and I got 4 slices and shared, because they all looked so good. We ate here 2 days in a row! The 3rd time we tried to go back the line was Waaaayyy to long., We were pissed! lol..This is definitely our new go-to next time we come to NY and we will be back!!! lol"
4-Jan-23,"I've been a fan of Joe's Pizza for years and it never disappoints. The slice is always hot and fresh, with the perfect balance of cheese and sauce. The crust is crispy and the toppings are always fresh.One of the things I love about Joe's is the no-frills atmosphere. It's a casual spot where you can grab a quick slice and go, or sit and enjoy your meal at one of the tables. The staff is always friendly and efficient, and the prices are extremely reasonable.If you're in the area and in the mood for a classic New York slice, definitely give Joe's a try. You won't be disappointed!"
3-Jan-23,"The worst pizza I've probably ever had. Barely any cheese and what cheese was on there got tossed around the box in transit when delivered. It was cold, thin, rubbery, tough and not flavorful. I've been hearing that this place is one of the BEST pizza places in NY and that couldn't be further from the truth.Do yourselves a favor if you're in town and go elsewhere, there's literally a million pizza spots in NY."
2-Jan-23,Pizza was so good. Line was long but so worth the wait. They had all sorts of pizza from pepperoni to caprese which was my favorite. The place is small inside so it's hard to find a place to sit. However people eat pretty fast so we were able to find a place to sit
1-Jan-23,This place has the worst costumer service. I was charged for a pie that I never received and they refused to refund me. AVOID!!!
31-Dec-22,"Busy busy busy! Delicious food but some of our slices were delivered to us pipin hot while others were still cold. Seems their process leaves too much error in judgment from the guy pulling the slices out of the oven. Still doable and would return if/when they're the only option (as it was last night, thanks to them being open until 5am). Otherwise, would try another pizzeria as there are so many fantastic options in the city. Decent ambiance, what one might expect on Times Square for a fast food joint."
30-Dec-22,The pizza here is amazing.  It's definitely worth the wait.  I ordered online but they only sell whole pies online.  I would say wait in line for the slices.  The ingredients taste fresh. If you're in the New York area. You have to try Joe's pizza.
28-Dec-22,"So yea ok, the New York style pizza is the better and low carb friendlier alternative to pan pizza and deep dish crust pizzas I used to pledge allegiance to.  Here are some pointers:1.  Don't expect friendly service.  You're in Times Square and they do not have time for small talk and pleasantries.  Plus you're a tourist.  They serve good, hot, cheap pizza and that's enough.2.  Stand in that line and just know that it will move fast.  See #1.3.  If you're ordering a slice, wait your turn in line.  If you're ordering a whole pie, they will tell you to skip the line and head straight to the cashier.  Except, wait for them to tell you because if you try to cut in front of me, I may go street on you.  4.  This place is the size of a standard NYC apartment, so basically, a thimble.  Order your pizza, and make your way to 'outside  seating'--loose term--where if you're lucky, you might score a space at the counter.  You may need to stand sideways though and not actually face the counter.  You came for pizza, not ambience.  5.  Fold your pizza in half and make you a pizza sandwich.  The crust will be crispy, red oil from the pepperoni will slide down your hands and fingers and you will love it.  6.  You might do well to order 2 slices.  The crust is only slightly thicker than a potato chip and that's not a bad thing."
28-Dec-22,"A bit touristy,  but was my family's favorite of the three pizza places we tried in NYC."
27-Dec-22,Fantastic pizza!! So worth standing in a 30 minute line ;). Complete worth the hype. The white pizza was the best!!!
26-Dec-22,"The iconic pizza place in NYC. Atmosphere: Basically a closet with two tables and some standing room only bars (very slight exaggeration). Definitely not enough area for the number of people who want to eat there. I guess that's NY chic? 1 StarService: Ummmm, the guy taking your order in line is perfectly fine letting you know that he wishes he was literally anywhere else right now. I get it, it's NY and that's how they are expected to act (the people we met all over NYC were very nice and polite, contrary to popular belief.) The cashier at least had a smile on her face. 0.5 StarFood: Ok, let's be honest, this is why you are here. Massive slabs of cheap pizza that is actually VERY good! I thought it lived up to the hype very well. I could see me doing this every day for a long while, if I moved to NYC. The perfect amount of crisp crust, yet still foldable (the method 95% of patrons use), and that sauce is perfect. The pepperoni and cheese pizzas were two of the best slices I have ever eaten. The wife had a slice of the Caprese, and it too was delicious. 2 StarsOverall: You just have to get past the kid impersonating Ebenezer Scrooge who takes the orders, and you will be golden. The pizza is worth it. And at that price it's a steal."
25-Dec-22,"A perfect bite of pizza. Cheesy, thin crispy crust with a little char... worth coming here even if it's out of your way. You won't regret! I can't wait to try their order pies!"
24-Dec-22,"The place to be if you want to have a great pizza in New York. Fast service, friendly people!"
22-Dec-22,Good pizza. Order online. Not worth waiting in line. Pops pizza is a tad better. Still good nyc pizza
22-Dec-22,Don't stone me...I wasn't impressed. I waited in a longgggg line wrapped around the corner for average pizza. So disappointed. Like super bumped it wasn't mouth watering.
21-Dec-22,"Quick delivery and delicious, hot, cheesy pizza. We ordered from here because we heard it was the best New York style pizza, and we were not disappointed!"
20-Dec-22,Joe's was a cool experience - Unfortunately the long lines have me removing a star. Had to wait quite a while.
19-Dec-22,Love joes for a late night slice! Great for after a night of drinking. It's nothing too crazy but just a solid nyc slice
18-Dec-22,Iconic pizza place in Times Square.  Wait times can be long so get there early.  Standing room for the most part so wait for a place or grab your slice and start walking.
18-Dec-22,Joes pizza is always delicious. Every time I travel to NY I stop by joes for a pie or a couple of slices.
17-Dec-22,So much hype but pizza is average. It didn't have that NYC speciality. I have had better pizzas at airports with flame fired versions.
16-Dec-22,"Best pie in NYC! Super fast delivery. Easy longline ordering. The pizza arrived hot and tasty! Perfect ratio of sauce , toppings, and cheese. Supplied utensils and plates as well."
15-Dec-22,Great spot for classic NY slice!! We ordered this to our hotel after a long day of site seeing and it really hit the spot! We were so hungry and it was so good I almost forgot to take a picture.
13-Dec-22,"Awesome location. Delicious pizza, great environment would recommend! really close to times square area!"
12-Dec-22,"The menu says cheese w/ any one topping but when we asked for a cheese with sausage, they said they don't do that? Pizza overall was just alright."
11-Dec-22,"Probably the best pizza my husband and I have ever had! We got the supreme no mushrooms and it was amazing! We went right when they opened. They opened late because they were not ready but they let us sit and save our spots. Very limited seating. Once we got our order people rushed in! Didn't look like anyone waited very long. We ordered a whole pizza and took about 15 minutes, but there were slices immediately available. Just an FYI I ate 1.5 slices of the box and my husband ate all but 3. He overestimated how hungry he was  However one single slice I think is more than enough! They are quite large!"
11-Dec-22,I'm sad to give this pizza place a 1 star. The pizza had no flavor at ALL! I'd expect a place that always has a line to make food with some flavor. Overly hyped.
10-Dec-22,"We came here after seeing A Christmas Carol at the Nederlander theater. I tried the pizzas here long ago, before the start of food influencers and ambassadors. Like me, I'm pretty sure you've had the best pizzas someplace else if you live here, but tourists come here due to its popularity. Spider-Man came here. Not the spider but the man. The service's excellent! Fast and friendly. We ordered the margaritas, the regular, spinach, and pepperoni slices. The spinach tends to have tons of garlic. I love garlic, but too overpowered with garlic. Roasted garlic would have been better on a piece, but this one was not. I only enjoyed the margarita slice, but that was all right. Others are better someplace else but don't just take my words for it. Just try it once if your trip brings you to NY. Average pizza with great service! Enjoy!"
9-Dec-22,A super classic New York slice that will always hit the spot. I think it's not worth standing in line for but all the slices are great and huge!
9-Dec-22,There will be a line but it moves very fast and the pizza is great. I would just got with the classic pepperoni. There are not many places to eat it but we found a spot. This is definitely a great place to grab a slice!
9-Dec-22,"Great place, fast service, and amazing pizza. They had exceptional customer service for how busy they are."
8-Dec-22,Love me some Joe's pizza!!! Such a classic New York slice in my opinion. The prices have gone up since last time we were here but what hasn't honestly. Slices of cheese are $4.00 / with toppings $5.00Bottled sodas are $3.00 Highly recommend!!!
8-Dec-22,"The pizza is delicious here! Be prepared to stand in line and if you chose to order take out or delivery , it will have to be a large ! Slices are extremely generous... a large is enough to feed a family of 4 !! This is one of our fav spots in the city !"
8-Dec-22,Got a large pepperoni delivered to the hotel and headed to Central Park for a picnic before leaving for the airport. The ultimate representative of delicious New York pizza. An amazing way to wrap up a NYC trip!!
6-Dec-22,"""They;re tourists, what do they know"" Rizzo.This was my favorite pizza of all time  and now the price for fame is being paid. The price is quality and taste. My wife and I recently went to NYC for a long weekend, which made me look up my prior review. Being ex NYC Metro residents we are passionate about our Pizza, bagels and bread. We were doing a grazing day for food and dinner was to be a slice or two. We approached Joe's and lo and behold there was a line. A LINE! never before. I know they were recently reviewed , again, on YouTube bit, a line? We didn't want to venture out further and figured we would wait for a slice of deliciousness. After 40 minutes we got to the end of the line and the prices were still reasonable. We grabbed our goal and went to eat;then it happened. No flavor, cardboard texture  and lack of spices. Horrible pizza that I can get on any corner. We were so disappointed since it was barely edible. What do the tourists think after all of raving about it, to only find this abomination. How disappointing for us after three years away from what we felt was a classic. I guess they started to believe all the hype, and now mass produced this inedible pizza. To paraphrase a great man: ""With great power, comes great responsibility"":"
6-Dec-22,"Prompt service considering the volume they have, pizza was good. Not the best I've had, but, good. The crust had a good chew to it, the cheese was alright. The sauce fell flat, and tasted almost watered down. All things considered I would hunt for a little hole in the wall shop before waiting in line here."
6-Dec-22,This pizza doesn't live up to the hype. Which could be location specific however John's pizza is a strong 9/10 compared to the 4/10 we graded this location of Joe's.
4-Dec-22,Never order from this place.  Delivery guy claimed pizza was at the hotel lobby.  Never showed up.  Accused the lobby of throwing away my pizza in the trash.  At a $1k/night hotel.  Rubbish.  Never order from these jerks.  Liars.
4-Dec-22,We came to NYC for one thing and one thing only and it's to taste the pizza here! I can sadly but confidently say this has ruined any pizza for me. Would go to NYC just for this pizza again!
3-Dec-22,"I don't get all the hype!? The crust was burnt and the pizza was just plain BlAH!We had half cheese and 1/2 pepperoni.I have had much, much better pizza!"
2-Dec-22,"They say New York has the BEST pizza, so we had to make sure to try it. The Caprese and Supreme pizza slices were DELICIOUS.The lines here were LONG, I suggest y'all grab a snack before dropping by.  Anyways, I definitely recommend stopping by for a slice of pizza while walking around Times Square!"
29-Nov-22,"I finally got around to trying the famous Joe's pizza. The wait was about 10 min but the space was quite crowded, which I expected due to this location being close to Times Square. The cheese slice was $4 which is likely an inflated price but still good for NYC. I was expecting a low quality pizza due to the hype seeming overly exaggerated but Joe's was surprisingly decent. I'd probably stop back in again which I don't normally do when places are so crowded. The actual slice was pretty standard; great cheese, good sauce ratio and a nice semi-burnt crust, just the way I like it. Would I put this slice at the top of my favorite slices in NYC? No, but I can understand why Joe's got the fame they have."
29-Nov-22,"I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty hard for me to enjoy pizza. I'm very picky BUT Joe's Pizza outdid themselves. I decided on having the spinach pizza, which is something I always get, and for it being a big size I devoured it in one piece! Hha i highly recommended. It's gonna be crowded depending on the time and also good luck on finding a place to sit. Wear comfortable shoes if you do go just in case if you need o wait and stand while you wat"
26-Nov-22,Long wait that wasn't worth it. Slices were burnt to hell. It crumbled in my hand from how hard it was. I'm going to get a hot dog.
26-Nov-22,"BEST pizza, hands down.   Was so good we went back again for more.  Lots of options; there is almost always a line, but it moves quickly, so don't let that scare you away.  The employees are great."
26-Nov-22,"Quintessential slice of nyc pizza. Great bite, phenomenal crust, and good cheese to sauce ratio!Not terribly priced and is quite large in portion!A bit of a tourist trap, but it's a great slice nevertheless!I'd recommend the regular cheese pizza! Cheers"
25-Nov-22,"THE BEST PIZZA!!!  I literally felt like I was living an experience and not just going to some random restaurant to eat a slice of pizza; the staff it's so friendly, and the pizza is super tasty, worth the wait in line."
25-Nov-22,"Phenomena spot!!  Place was packed, pizza was DELICIOUS, and customer service was incredible.  Loved it!!  Thank you!!"
24-Nov-22,"Not bad pie but a bit pricey for what you're getting and all the $1 slice spots nearby. Got the meat lovers pizza. The sauce was sweet, sausage discs went too heavy oregano, some of the crust was black. It was alright but could probably get a better slice for the price"
19-Nov-22,This is my favorite pizza place ever!! I come here every time I am in New York and I will continue to come here! It is a highlight of my trip!
18-Nov-22,"This is the famous NY pizza parlor, written up in The NY Times. All I can say that it deserves the hype. Excellent pizza! The crust was thin and chewy; the sauce was ""tomatoey"" and garlicky (a little salty, which I like); and the pepperoni was delicious. I try to grab at least a slice, every day that I am in town. 5 stars because I can't give more."
18-Nov-22,"Joe's Pizza definitely is a must-try! Their pizza is worth the wait. You will probably see a long line outside of the shop, but the line does move fairly quickly. The slices are around $5-$ a slice. But. the slices are pretty big. We ordered the supreme, Caprese, cheese, fresh mozz, and white. Personally, my favorites were the supreme and Caprese. They heat the slices before giving them to you. The cheese is perfectly melted to create a nice cheese pull and the crust is perfectly toasted. Overall, I will 100% come back to Joe's Pizza again."
18-Nov-22,Deeeelicioussss!!!! Best in the area! $4 a slice tourist price. Fresh because there's always a line.
18-Nov-22,"This place was Bomb AF. Now it's always packed, but the service is amazing and the li e goes quick. The location it was recommended, so I had to try it out. The sausage and Pepperoni was good. But to me, the pure Pepperoni pie was the shit. I also had a Sicilian pizza, which was a thick pie with cheese, but just add a little dried cilantro that's offered in the shakers, and that changed everything. It's something we all need to go try and check out. Save me a slice, I'm coming too."
17-Nov-22,"When in NYC, this was one of the top tourist activity. The line moved fast but there was always a long line. The pizza was pretty inexpensive and came out pretty fast. I was able to find a seat near their wall of fame. But since it was so busy, I would plan for takeout.Overall, the pizza was over hyped. It's a great on the go choice while travelling but I wouldn't especially come out here for a slice."
17-Nov-22,A must have if you're in NY. There was a line out the door (which moved very quickly) but we took that as a good sign that this plus must be good! Wish we had something like this at home in CA!
17-Nov-22,"Solid pizza, but I'm sure there are better options around. I think everyone knows Joe's as the class NY pizza spot, which likely has caused the increase in price over time. When I came, it was $5 for a slice which is a lot more compared to the other places you see walking around.We opted for a slice of pepperoni pizza, which they heated and served quickly. The slice itself was large and thin, with a nice crispy crust. I really did like the texture, and the sauce, cheese, and pepperoni topping were all pretty good as well. There wasn't too much that stood out about this except for the crust, which really captured the NYC pizza essence. Worth a try for sure, but I do feel that you can get something better in the area."
17-Nov-22,"Popped in for a quick slice while visiting town- delicious and well-worth it. Hot and fresh, one of the best slices I've had in a while. Will definitely come back here."
16-Nov-22,"Famous pizza spot in the city that made an appearance in the Spider-Man movie. Long line but moves pretty quick. Got the caprese and it was pretty good - thin crust, not flimsy, not too saucy or heavy. $5-$5.50 per slice and they're a good size. Not a lot of space to eat your pizza, so gotta squeeze in with everyone else. There's also standing room outside. Not sure if I'd wait in the line again because it was good but not the best pizza I've had. But now I can say I've tried Joe's! Worth the experience!"
16-Nov-22,Ugh........ Me and my girlfriend wanted to love this place so bad because it was our first NY pizza and everyone kept recommending it to me but it was just.... Ok.... It needed more sauce and more salt and it needs more meat choices they literally only had sausage and pepperoni. The customer service isn't great either but it's NY so we kinda expect it. The good part about this pizza is it's huge and the dough is good so you will get full. Price isn't that bad and they do deliver and stay open til 3am Crust is burnt if you like it like that.
15-Nov-22,One of the best pizzas in NYC did not disappoint. Sometimes a long line but it moves quick! Get the classic cheese and pepperoni. I thought I could've skipped the white pizza it was a little bland compared to the other two. About $5 per slice they're nice crispy thin and takes up a lot of surface area.
15-Nov-22,"New York pizza at it's finest! We ordered the Supreme... the sauce was flavorful, the crust was perfectly New York thin to fold and eat, and the toppings were distributed artistically to ensure a perfect bite every time. I'm incredibly picky when it comes to food and Joe's exceeded my expectations! The pizza was delicious even after it got cold during our roadtrip."
13-Nov-22,"This is it. The pizza you want. The pizza you need. The one worth swinging 10 blocks for. The one where hey you'd love to save some for a good ol breakfast slice, but you know it won't come to that.  Eat it now."
11-Nov-22,Good enough if you're staying around Times Square and want a quick bite. I recommend the Sicilian.
11-Nov-22,When you order for delivery the pizza is all dried up like it's  been sitting there for hours ! These restaurants need to keep up with the program if you want to have a good quality restaurant no matter what your selling let it be the best and not garbage !!! Just garbage !!!Please New York bring back the true Italian pizzeria's  made by true Italian's  !!!!
9-Nov-22,"Picked up a slice of pizza for a quick late dinner while walking back to my hotel, JK you know the line was long as shit.  So I stood in line for probably about 20 minutes, watching a giant cockroach try to climb up a pole.  When I finally got to the counter, I thought I should probably order two slices to make the wait worthwhile.  Got pepperoni and margherita.  I ate the pepperoni slice at the standing counter, as another, smaller, cockroach tried to fight me for it.  I said, ""not today, cockroach.""  Seriously, I love New York City.  The pepperoni slice was very good, but not sure it was worth the wait, as it wasn't necessarily better than other NY slices I've had."
7-Nov-22,Joe's Pizza deserves all of its recognition for serving amazing pizza. Granted the slices are pricer than other pizzerias but it's so worth it. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and the line was outside the door (don't be intimidated by it because it goes by super fast). They have a great selection of pies and they accept cash/card. They don't have the biggest seating area but people go in and out quickly so it's not that big of an issue. We ordered:* Supreme* Caprese* Cheese* Sicilian and two drinks which came out to around $26 (definitely pricier but everything was delicious) Our favorites were definitely the supreme and cheese slices. Hot pizza with melty cheese and a perfect crust on a paper plate is just chef kiss. I would 100% come back here again and try out the rest of their menu.
6-Nov-22,The best classic New York slice! The perfect think crust and the perfect right amount of cheese set Joe apart. You will want to go back to get more and you also won't feel terrible after eating four slices. Came on a Friday night and waited about 20 minutes. Got the cheese slice and caprese. Cheese is the best! I'd stick to all cheese slices next time
6-Nov-22,"Not bad. Must-try cause it's touristy. A little overrated, but still a solid slice. The Sicilian looks like cafeteria food, but it's actually really good. Kind of gets dinged a bit because the line is so long and the tourist shop next door decided to subject the line to Christian Talk Radio on a loudspeaker and there's a funky smell while you wait.Food: 3/5Value: 3/5Experience: 2/5Service: 5/5Ambiance: 3/5Good For: tourists. MCU fans. Late night bite.There's a really funny Kevin Bacon quote about his last day on earth if you can find it."
6-Nov-22,"Worth any line wait. Yum, Yum yum!   Thin crispy crust pies with toppings that are fresh and perfectly proportioned.  Best in the city. Keep it simple. No need to say anything more.  Mmmm"
30-Oct-22,"Expectations run high when you pay $5 for a slice of pepperoni pizza. It was definitely one of the better NY pizzas out there, but at this price point ""above average"" wasn't really good enough for me. Maybe the other flavors are better, but we could probably find better pizza for the price. I think it works for occasionally taking friends for the NY pizza experience, but I personally wouldn't make this my go-to."
30-Oct-22,"Solid New York City pizza.  The plain cheese slice is the best.  Most of the time the pizza is consistent - crispy, good cheese and sauce flavor.  The only thing is it gets really crowded and if you try to eat your pizza there, you will need to squeeze in among strangers.  Doesn't make for a very clean or sanitary experience.  Best if you gobble down your pizza quickly and be on your way.  The line can get long but does move quickly."
28-Oct-22,"A must in NYCDon't let the line scare you.  It moves quickly.  Plenty of options with pizza, served by the slice ,and reasonably priced.  Take your box to go or eat in the little standing room space.  Don't expect to be here for more than 30 minutesThere's a reason the line here is long and that this place is named ""The most famous pizza"" in NYC.You won't regret stopping in.  Yes the location is right by TImes Square so expect a lot of tourists but you'll be so into your pizza and the ooey gooey heavenly bites of it that you won't even remember the long line, wait time or the annoying tourists that are near by"
27-Oct-22,This place is overhyped. The people who make the pizza aren't professional and routinely overcook the pizza. Cheese makes it soggy and not crisp. I would recommend you try other places.
27-Oct-22,"Extremely nice staff, pizza is cooked perfectly. Nice crunch and the toppings were delicious. Very fast pace but what else do you expect in New York. Will be coming back!"
27-Oct-22,"Joes Pizza needs no introduction. Its arguably one of the most famous pizza spots in NYC, and as a pizza lover, I was fairly excited to try a slice of this pizza that everyone speaks so highly of. The line was somewhat long but moved very quickly. I'd say that I was already at the front of the line after waiting only 10 minutes or so.To keep it simple, I ordered both a pepperoni and cheese slice (not pictured). The cheese slice while decent, wasn't anything to write home about and tasted similar to any regular cheese slice from a pizza shop in NYC. The pepperoni slice was much more enjoyable and had much better flavor. Despite the taste being underwhelming, the presentation of the pizza and aura of the shop were appealing in their own right. I enjoyed my short time at Joes and would probably come back if it was in my path or if I was craving a quick slice."
26-Oct-22,Good pizza stop. This place has a lot of history and is right off of time square. Definitely worth the stop if you are in that area. The only down side is that they are always packed and will require a wait. But that may also show how good they are. Great prices also.
26-Oct-22,"You don't come here for the pizza, you come here because of the culture! So you can say you've been to Joes pizza in New York - you know - the famous one? You come here when it's 2am and nothing sounds better than a New York pizza when you're drunk!The pizza itself is not bad at all, but it's not as mind blowing as people make it to be - I don't think it tastes any different than other pizzas, except for maybe a step above 99 cent pizza.But I'm always here to have a good time. The staff is nice, the pictures of mentions of the famous joes pizza on the walls to remind you that it's a great place to be. Pizza is a little pricy, but for the experience, why the heck not"
26-Oct-22,Visiting from out of town and had to try this iconic pizza place. It did not disappoint! Pizza was hot and tasted amazing. It's not really a sit down restaurant but we found a table to stand around and enjoy our pizza at. We got the pepperoni and supreme. Both were amazing.
26-Oct-22,"Out of all the slices of pizza I gobbled down during my New York escapade, Joe's hit the spot the hardest. On my first stop I got slices of Pepperoni and Sicilian, both were delicious! I had to double back the same day to try more. That time, I tried the Caprese. Fantastic! I'm excited to go back for more!"
25-Oct-22,Just returned from spending 5 nights in NYC and we ate at Joes pizza 3 times. It was so good!
24-Oct-22,"Amazing pizza! Fast service, definitely would recommend everybody try it out when in Time Square."
23-Oct-22,Delicious pizza and nice hardworking men serving them. Worth the long wait. It's a pretty big slice
22-Oct-22,"MEAL: DinnerORDER TYPE: Carry outMY ORDER EXPERIENCE:This place needs no introduction because Joe's Pizza had been around since 1975. This pizza place had celebrity customers and featured in various shows. This location is closer to Times Square. It's one of the most popular pizza places to try in New York. Being a pizza lover, I was looking forward to trying pizza at this restaurant. As anticipated, there was a long queue and it took about 30 mins for me to place my order at the counter. They had both indoor and outdoor seating with limited space availability. Most of the orders were carry outs. Once you walk into the place, you will notice the pictures of famous celebrities who have tried Joe's pizza over the period of time. As I was getting closer to the counter, they displayed the pizzas in the see-through glass. As we scanned through the menu, my friends couldn't find chicken which was surprising to us so we had to settle for Veggie Pizza and Caprese Pizza. We ordered the entire Pie of each and each pie comes with 8 slices.  I had to wait for an additional 30 min to get my pizza which was quite annoying. As I was waiting, I got to see the whole Joe's pizza making process which was quite interesting. The pizzas are placed in a special oven where the pizza is well baked. After a long wait, we finally got our pizza. As soon as I got the pizza, I first had the Veggie Pizza right away. The presentation itself was so appealing and after I took the first bite it was so delicious. The pizza dough was soft and fresh. The Veggie pizza had broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, onions and olives. As I was working through, I couldn't enjoy it further. Second, I had the Caprese Pizza which had sliced tomatoes, basil, fresh mozzarella cheese and extra virgin olive oil. This was my favorite of both. Both pizzas had the right amount of sauce and the toppings."
21-Oct-22,Best New York pizza !! Would recommend to anyone coming to the city for the first time and really wanted to experience a delicious New York style slice! Wish I lived closer to buy more !
21-Oct-22,"Joe's Pizza is where I got my first authentic slice of NY pizza, and it did not disappoint! The price is reasonable, the flavor is on point, and it's everything a thin crust should be--perfectly crisp with each bite, yet soft to chew. The vibe is charming and iconic, and while the lines are long, the employees know how to really hustle and get pizza out quick. Would definitely recommend!"
18-Oct-22,Go to 99 cent pizza around the corner. It's cheaper and better. My 5$ slice was mediocre and the cashier was rude and had no patience lol. Line is usually long so I thought it was good. Disappointed
17-Oct-22,"Simply Greaf Pizza!. Try their Supreme thin crust, so so good.  A lot of famous people visit this particular restaurant . If you're in Time Square make sure you  visit this place"
16-Oct-22,Definitely worth the wait don't be fool by the long lines outside because it goes fast the pizza always come out fresh and hot would definitely recommend anyone who's visiting Nyc to stop by here and grab a slice one
13-Oct-22,Fast service the pizza was hot and fresh. The sauce was okay. We got pepperoni only. May need to try other kinds.
12-Oct-22,"I really wanted to try Joe's due to how much people rave about it. Line was reasonable and moves at a fast pace. Not sure if I got a bad batch that day or if it's in general but as you can tell in the picture my cheese pizza crust had an inflated black char bubble to it which did not look appetizing and did not help with the flavor. I had high expectations based on everything I heard about Joe's and after eating both slices, I would say I'm still searching for the best slice out there as I've had better."
10-Oct-22,"Great place to get a couple slices of pizza when near Times Square.  We went before a Broadway show and it was perfect for a quick bite.  Pizza was good and service was fast, even though there was a line out the door."
10-Oct-22,"Maybe I just had too high of an expectation based on previous reviews and comments but I was not too impressed. It was an average slice of pizza. It had a thin crust which allowed the flavors of the toppings to power through. We ordered a Sicilian pizza (thicker crust), white pizza with spinach, and supreme pizza. I think the spinach was a bit bitter or leafy tasting and took away from the cheesy flavor of the white pizza so if I go again, I would go for just white. The Sicilian pizza was good but it was also very plain. Overall it was good pizza but I actually think Antonio's pizza in RI could beat this place in a competition."
8-Oct-22,Terrible.   Absolutely burnt!!  We are from New Jersey and definitely were hoping for delicious pizza fromNew York. Sadly this is disappointing
7-Oct-22,"Chose this pizza place mainly because it was near the hotel that I was staying at (a.k.a. had no idea of its affiliation with the Spider-Man franchise or that it's apparently a popular place celebs go to for pizza lol). Ordered a whole pie with three custom toppings: mushrooms, meatball, and spinach. It had the crispy crust that I love in NY-style pizza. Wished that there was a tad more tomato sauce though. Wasn't the hugest fan of the spinach as it was a bit too salty for my liking.There were a handful of people in line when I arrived at around 5 pm on a weekday but the line went through super fast. Ordering a whole pie through Yelp/Grubhub ahead of time for takeout was super efficient and convenient!"
7-Oct-22,"Now this is top notch 5 star pizza. Holy crap this was amazing! If you want true NY pizza you must definitely stop by here. My god, every single bite was absolutely amazing! Food: the thin crust here is probably the best thin crust I have ever had in my life and I have had a lot of pizza in my time! A lot lol. This was the best thing crust. Romano's in houston used to be my number 1 thin crust but they have been dethroned unfortunately. So much flavor. The crust is so crispy. Everything is very fresh and amazingly great! The Sicilian slice was okay. NY pizza sumprea had a much better deep dish Sicilian slice but let me tell you for thin crust no one is touching these guys. Not with a ten foot pole!  I would fly back just for this pizza. So dam good! Service is great! The line was quite long but we got in and out very fast. Not much for seating but who cares. This is great pizza!"
7-Oct-22,"They're pretty generous with their tomato slices on the veggie pizza. But with the power of hindsight, go for the supreme -- it's noticeably betterWould i go out of my way to wait half an hour for a $5 pizza again? No. But glad to know that my search for the best slice of pizza can mark this place off the list"
2-Oct-22,WORST PIZZA IVE EVER HAD! first time in New York. first pizza in New York. it was soggy (almost watery) and the so-called meat looked scary. so gross!!!
2-Oct-22,"This place definitely feels like a tourist trap to me. It's cool that they have a bunch of celeb photos on the wall, but located in the Times Square I feel like thats to be expected. The food is good don't ge me wrong though. Its great if you only have a couple min to grab a bite. But for great NY pizza you can def find it somewhere else."
1-Oct-22,I'm case you are unaware this is where Spider-Man was filmed. So we made it one of our stops. Read the reviews. They don't disappoint. The lines seem long but we ordered and had our slices in a matter of minutes. I got a slice of the caprese and a supreme. Couldn't decide and why should I have to I'm on vacation darn it. lol. Good sauce slice and the ingredients taste super fresh. The basil hits the pallet. You know each slice of different in its own right.
30-Sep-22,"Simple, delicious, NY pizza. We were able to try about 4 different types of pizza they had out the night we went and they all were great. Prices are fair and even though the line was out the door, it moved fairly quickly."
29-Sep-22,"This is what you should expect from a New York Pizzeria. Fast service (mostly because the handler is hurrying you for your order so you better know what you want ) hot, thin pizza. The pepperoni was excellent, the ""undercarriage"" is thin but not so thin that you are required to fold it like a taco in order to eat it. The crust was pretty much like a cracker so I had one bite and did not finish it for fear of breaking a molar . The sauce was decent but definitely straight out of can. That said the pizza was hot and solid especially for $13 bucks including a soda. I may come again but it will definitely be an after the bars situation"
29-Sep-22,"Finally got around to try joes after the few times I've visited NYC. Honestly when I tried the pizza here I thought it wasn't really that special and that joes is overrated. Maybe it was the pizza we got, which was the caprese, but it felts kinda dry? Like I wished there was slightly more sauce, but I also don't like it when my pizzas have too much sauce. I did like the fresh tomatoes on the pizza though but I think I still like another pizza spot more."
28-Sep-22,"My favorite slice in the world. Just don't mind the clueless tourists who move slow, hijack the the crushed red pepper and oregano, and leave their trash behind. ‚Äç"
27-Sep-22,Attentive servers! They got it under control and know what they're doing. Also pizza  was good. They have a vegetarian option for those who don't eat meat.
26-Sep-22,"Located in the heart of Time Square, of course this place is definitely a tourist trap. It's cool that they filmed the Spider-man movies here and they have all the celeb photos up on the wall, but I gotta say, the pizza was very average. Our first impression was the super long line. We waited 20 minutes. The prices are definitely higher than several other pizza places in the city. We ordered 4 slices for a total of $20!The pizza itself was alright. The red sauce on my pepperoni slice seemed a bit too acidic and could've had more cheese/pepperoni for $5/slice. The ricotta white pizza (not pictured) was pretty good, but not good enough for us to venture back into the hectic streets of Time Square. Be warned, the pizza is not worth the line. But if you want to stop by for the fun of it, don't expect too much from the pizza."
25-Sep-22,Had to come here cuz my son wanted to eat Spider-Man pizza and it did not disappoint!! So glad we went!!
24-Sep-22,"Was in the area so we ordered three slices: supreme, white, and cheese. My favorite was white- it hit all my cravings in one bite! Would I say it's the best pizza in town? I'd say I've had better, but it was good enough for a midday snack! The line can get long, but it moved pretty fast!"
24-Sep-22,"FLAVOR (4/5): First slice of authentic New York pizza. The crust at the end was a bit too thick for me and burnt, but the crust under the pizza was super thin. It didn't wow me away like I thought it would, but still a decent slice of pizza. INSTAGRAM WORTHY (4/5): When you walk in you see the Spider-Man memo, you see celebrities posing with the owner on the walls. The pizza itself is a huge slice but it's sandwiched on a paper plate. SERVICE (4/5): Fast service as expected for how busy they get. The line goes by pretty quick. They accept Apple Pay here! TAKEAWAYS: Don't have high expectations! It's a solid slice of pizza but they make so much of it it's hard to quality control everything. Tried it, but wouldn't be coming back!"
23-Sep-22,"I went into Joe's looking for a life changing New York pizza experience. So many influencers and celebrities praise this pizza place, but it turned out to be mediocre. We ordered the pepperoni and cheese pizzas. The pizza was good but it was not great. Perhaps my hopes were too high, but I would not come back again."
22-Sep-22,We ordered 4 pies and they are delicious. Everyone at the event loved the pizzas. Thank you
21-Sep-22,New York classic for a quick pizza before a Broadway show.Un cl√°sico de Nueva York para comer una pizza r√°pida antes de un espect√°culo en Broadway.
17-Sep-22,"Some of the best pizza I've ever had! Super thin and crunchy crust, gooey delicious cheese! And super reasonable prices! Highly recommend!"
16-Sep-22,"Was visiting New York for the first time, so it was absolutely necessary that I tried a slice of authentic New York pizza. After doing a lot of research, I settled on the trademark of Joe's pizza, and I was anything but disappointed. First off, if the pizza does not go over the paper plate, it's not New York style pizza! I appreciated their classic obedience to this one cardinal rule, but what's even better was how sensational the pizzas were! I went with a classic cheese, pepperoni, Caprese, and supreme pizza to get the diversity (and yes, the four pieces were split with my partner). Each slice was fresh, full of grease, and the perfect balance of hardy and crispy. The dough was light, airy, but also held a punch of flavor, which was phenomenal. All of the ingredients were fresh, and it was if all the flavors simply melted in your mouth. I would say my favorites ranked as follows: Supreme, Caprese, Pepperoni, than Cheese, but not one of them was a miss! There is a fair share of standing areas to eat, and although extremely busy, the costumer service was efficient, and friendly, especially when it comes to the New York standard of customer service! If you want a piece of authentic New York pizza, this is the place to be! It is most definitely worth the lines outside of the store, and it was so good, I had to go back a second time before flying back to Los Angeles! Overall, a fantastic experience, especially for a great price of less than $25 for four HUGE slices of New York pizza!"
16-Sep-22,"10/10! Third time visiting NY and didn't get a chance to stop by this place till now. Finally got to try NY style pizza and price is super affordable for a huge slice of goodness! Located just a few steps to Time Square and lines are usually long but moves fairly fast. It's a small spot that offers a few dining tables and chairs for dine-in. Tried several on their menu to share with my boyfriend: caprice pizza, pepperoni pizza and supreme pizza. First bite of the caprice pizza, my palate went on Fiesta mode! It was juicy, flavorful, tastes fresh, and  had that light crunch to it! Their pizza comes in thin crust and both pepperoni and supreme pizza slices were heaven!"
16-Sep-22,I found this place by asking an on-duty NYPD where to get pizza at midnight. The NYPD is good at a lot of things. This is New York pizza at its finest.
13-Sep-22,OMG - what a slice. Try to time your visit so you don't wait in a long line. I've walked in and I've waited 30 minutes. In any case it's one of my favorites! The cheese slice is my favorite.
10-Sep-22,The cheese. The sauce. The crust. Small place with a long line but quick service. Definitely worth the wait.
8-Sep-22,"Tried out Joes pizza because we heard it's one of the must go pizza stops in NYC. Does the job! Quick good pizza but the prices were a bit high, about $5 per slice. The pizza wasn't amazing but we were just looking for a classic piece of New York style pizza"
8-Sep-22,The BEST pizza in nyc. Only down side is the long line because it's so tasty but they keep it moving. Love stoping here for a late night slice after Broadway.
5-Sep-22,"One of the best pizza's I've ever had. That simple. That is saying a lot. Worth the trip if you are remotely in the area. Crust, sauce, and cheese are perfection. Do yourself a favor and go to Joes."
5-Sep-22,I always have to come grab a box of pizza from here when I visit New York! It's just too damn good  The line does get long during the evening but is worth the wait! I came to Joe's around 10:30 pm waited about 30 minutes to order. They do close late I believe around 3 am which is a huge plus. It is a little expensive but the pizza tastes delicious. I always order a large veggie pizza and it tastes amazing. The crust is delicious and crispy and even when I reheat my leftovers it still tastes great. I highly recommend trying it especially if you're a tourist and don't know which pizza place to try in New York. I can't wait to go back to New York and have more pizza from Joe's!
3-Sep-22,"Pizza was amazing. Went to a couple other places in nyc but when this arrived I was shocked. The crust was a perfect salty goodness, a thin crust. Got the white pie. Wished I could try more but have to leave."
2-Sep-22,One of the best pizzas I've had. They do not do half orders. Best to go with the whole pizza or you will be paying by the slice which adds up quickly. Be prepared to stand in a line. Definitely worth trying at least once. When you're done with your pizza they ask you to stack your pizza boxes on the sidewalk.
2-Sep-22,"I don't normally give reviews but Joe's Pizza deserves a good one! They're consistently good each time I come, I like their margherita pizza especially. They were also extremely sweet when I accidentally dropped my slice and supplied me another one immediately. I highly recommend it if you're coming to New York and looking for a good slice of pizza!"
31-Aug-22,"I've been wanting to try the original Joe's on my quick pizza journey in NY. This might be the most touristy location of Joe's, but then again Joe's is popular to tourists like me.From what I expect, it's a simple slice. From reality, it's a simple slice.But it's a darn decent simple slice, the iconic benchmark."
29-Aug-22,"Great place for pizza. If you're a tourist this is a must spot for you to go and check out the pizza. Be prepared for the line no matter what time you go. This place is very packed because of how popular and good it is!It's also close to time square so if you're planning on going there, this is a good place to eat. Pizzas come in slices or a whole pie. Slices are heated up so just a headsup, the quality will not be the same. Once you walk in to the place, you'll notice all the famous celebrities that been here previously and how it's been in multiple articles in the past. The staff is very friendly and the price is reasonable. The slices are big too. I loved their cheese pizza"
28-Aug-22,"Geez!!!! The line for this place seems to be never ending ! and for good reason. The line moved suprisingly fast, so don't be discouraged and give it ago, unlike the other .99c NY Pizza, they offer lots of variety and the atmosphere is second to none, it is busy, it is fast and importantly the pizza tastes amazing !!!"
28-Aug-22,Okay pizza. Not as fresh as we like it and maybe that's by design when serving by the slice but still we didn't realize the pizza would just be out for viewing and then reheated. The pizza itself was okay but lacked flavor. The crust was nice and crunchy. Still searching for the best nyc pizza
27-Aug-22,Perfect slice !  Well worth the wait in line .  A must do while in the city !  Best pizza around and consistent!
26-Aug-22,"Came on a Friday afternoon around 2pm. The line goes out of the store, but it moves pretty quickly. I ordered a slice of pepperoni. The slice itself is pretty big. The pepperonis were perfectly crispy. There was a good cheese pull. The slice was oily but wasn't saturated with oil. The crust was thin, but it holds up all the contents of the slice. However, I didn't enjoy the end of the crust as much because of the slightly harder texture.There's not a lot of seating inside, but there are little areas to stand out outside."
24-Aug-22,"Great pizza.  I was a little worried that this was just a tourist trap that didn't have good food, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The line was pretty long and took a little longer than I would have normally waited for a slice of pizza, but it was worth it when I got the pizza.  It was tasty, classic, hot, and fresh.  I'd like to go again if I can catch them without quite such a long line."
22-Aug-22,DEVINE!  Don't miss this delicious pizza spot that is worth the line.  We also had it delivered to our hotel with no problems.  Highly recommend
19-Aug-22,"We flew in from LA and after checking in to our hotel we went to Joe's pizza and got two whole pizza's, pepperoni and mushroom, and Caprese.  Amazing, the four of us ate it all, we were starving and it really hit the spot.  Love NY style pizza and this was the best.  They were super busy but they made the pizza in 15 minutes!"
19-Aug-22,"Great NY style pizza at a reasonable price.  Nothing fancy, just what you would expect from a NYC pizzeria.  Will order again."
18-Aug-22,"The pizza at the Times Square location is okay, but it is often too busy, as it is a tourist trap.  I think the consistency of the pizza here varies the most compared to the other Joe's Pizzas."
18-Aug-22,Quick bite for a lunch. Tasty at the reasonable price.But to buy 2+ slices. Go early to avoid long lines.
16-Aug-22,Go to Domino's!! Bad attitude and soggy pie...loosing combo! I ordered two pies...both were nasty. We each (3 ppl) had a piece and had to toss the rest...$75 down the drain. Thankfully  GrubHub helped to make it right by giving us credit for one with a nice attitude.
16-Aug-22,Pizza is good but obviously a tourist trap. Right around the corner is literally pizza slice that is a dollar per slice. There is a long line here too. This pizza is much pricier than the $1 slice spots but does not even taste any better. The man behind the counter was rlly friendly and had great energy though.
16-Aug-22,"Best pizza ever! I don't generally like pizza.... I know, I know! In my defense, I'm from California. Joe's was recommended to me by a friend that knows I'm picky about food, well I don't like to waste calories. This pizza! Gosh, I should have ordered two slices for myself, or the whole goddamn pie.Thin crust, a lil crunchy, amazing sauce, and well I had the supreme :-) stop by  have an extra slice for me"
15-Aug-22,"This place is very popular but happy to say it lives up to the hype! I got the fresh mozzarella slice and would 10/10 recommend, we also tried the pepperoni but the mozz was a lot better. Thin, big, great flavour and a reasonable price. This location is very central to a lot of tourist spots so it's quite busy but the line went fast and they're very organized."
14-Aug-22,"One of the best NYC slices; fast, hot and delicious. My only complaint is there seems to be no AC on, so the placing is sweltering on a hot day. The staff also could do a better job keeping the tables and floor clean. The pizza alone is 5 stars."
14-Aug-22,"The ultimate, the quintessential, THE BEST slice in NYC. Nothing beats a cheesy, melty slice of Joe's hot out of the oven."
13-Aug-22,"""Pizza time."" I'm a huge Spider-Man fan so to go to Joe's Pizza where Peter Parker worked in the second movie, I was geeking out. Didn't quite live up to the hype. I feel it's a good average slice of pizza. I got the white with garlic and spinach. The spinach is all wet and had no flavor. I hardly got to taste the pizza because a bunch of wet leaves are on my dough. If it had been arugula, that would've been delicious. I've had many tell me about Joe's and it wasn't anything special. I've had pizza in Inwood or other places that are just as good. Also saw a fight break out right outside the store where 6 employees were beating up this guy. I don't know the story, but yeah, that made me a little on edge going into the store where they worked."
10-Aug-22,OK for a late night snack when nothing else is open. Lines are very long during the day
9-Aug-22,"The crust couldn't get any thinner and it was crispy. Pretty tasty and would definitely come back. Standing room only if that, lol."
8-Aug-22,One of the better pizzas I've had in nyc. Definitely in my top 3 for sure as of now. Can't wait to have it again
8-Aug-22,"Came for the hype. Eh, it was pretty good. Crust was a little burnt. Guy behind the counter was nice. But $3.60For a slice of pizza? Not my style, maybe the other locations taste better"
7-Aug-22,"Joes was a welcomed option to heading back out in the city after a long day.   The pizza was all New York. Great toppings on the giant slices.  Delivery to our hotel was early and hot.  Thanks for making our night.  Oh yeah, they provided plates, napkins, and essential pizza topping without a request."
7-Aug-22,"This place was packed and had a huge line. It was really hot outside but the pizzas were worth the wait. The only kinds I would avoid buying are cheese and spinach. The rest are really good, especially the supreme."
6-Aug-22,There's always a line.  We've been to another location before and it never disappoints. The long line out the door can seem daunting but the staff is super efficient and it moves very quickly.  By the time you get your pizza there is room somewhere to enjoy your goodies. We ordered a pepperoni slice and a Sicilian.  My only complaint is the Sicilian slice could have been warmer. Definitely will keep Joe's as a go to for my NY pizza fix!
6-Aug-22,"Delicious New York pizza delivered in less than 30 minutes. I grew up in flushing queens and miss delicious authentic pizza in Nashville where I live now. There is good pizza but no real NY style pizza. We were exhausted and I am with a kid who is determined to not leave our hotel. I wanted to take her to Patsys or John's but it was a no go. Probably partially bc we hadn't eaten all day, the pizza was amazing. Thin crust. Hot. Foldable. Not too much cheese. Hit the mother freaking spot."
4-Aug-22,"Joe's pizza is the pizza! beautifully crafted NYC pizza, floppy and delicious!  if you want the best pizza, head to Joe's!"
2-Aug-22,"Most amazing pizza!  I am from California and I had a slice of this pizza first time at their West Village location, it was just awesome!!! So addictive that I came back to their other location on 42nd street before leaving New York.  This time I had a slice of Supreme and Mozzarella & Tomato. Just out of this world!!!"
1-Aug-22,"We went to joes pizza on our way to Times Square. You can order pizza by the slice or whole. They are very fast and pizza tastes great! We loved being able to eat here. Even with how busy and long the line was we were able to sit down and eat. Great service, staff and food. Definitely worth it!"
1-Aug-22,Was visiting NY Times Square and friend recommended this place.  Tried to go 3 times but the line was so long ...at 11pm at night!!!!! Finally got lucky once and there was a short line. Pizza was delicious. I don't even know what I got I forgot but I remember I loved it
31-Jul-22,"We had this on our trip out to NYC  and I am still daydreaming about it today. We decided to order a big pepperoni pizza for delivery during our stay and it did not disappoint. The crust was on the thinner side but that's NY pizza and honestly, I prefer it that way. Not too saucy and had the right pepperoni to crust ratio."
30-Jul-22,Great place to grab a delicious pizza! The restaurant is in an old church(?) with gorgeous stained glass and beautiful mural.
28-Jul-22,"Pizza can be a controversial topic of what is the best especially in NYC. I grew up on L&Bs and spumonis back in the day, and now it's not the same owners as it was years ago. There's a few favorites like Johns of Bleecker street and Mamas too that is my top 2 when I visit. I've had joes pizza down in the village before it started expanding. I believe that location was in the Spider-Man movie. Well the hubs wanted to try Joes and why not since the hotel we were staying at was a few minute walk. The lines are long and for good reason. You get that whole NYC experience of waiting on lines, paying high, and being in crowds especially Times Square. The employees are fast and efficient. The pizzas are fresh and have a high turnover rate due to the magnitude of customers. Prices vary dependent on toppings. The shop is small so eating indoors is not ideal. It's best to takeout or if your there for just a slice fold it and eat it out while walking Times Square. The hubs and I enjoyed the pizza. Some were lukewarm and didn't have that slight crisp but had that flop factor upon pickup. It did it's job filled my belly and I'm satisfied:)"
27-Jul-22,Best pizza in NYC! We've been multiple times and it's not only consistent but fast and perfect each time!
25-Jul-22,"Joe's Pizza Ratings: 4.4/5 Food: 4.75/5 - I know Joe's Pizza is overhyped and overrated, but this place holds a special place in my heart. Joe's at Times Square is where my boyfriend and I went to our first couple of dates. The pizza just tasted so much better with him, but seriously it is a top slice in NYC. See the descriptions below for the two pies we got to share before we head to our friend's place. - Supreme Pizza [GET]: My go to each time when I visit Joe's, gotta get all the meats on my pizza. The pepperoni and sausage is meaty, got a good amount of greasy, and I love the touch of the onion. There's a perfect amount of cheese to sauce ratio. The sauce was perfectly tangy, fresh, and sweet, and not too much of cheese or the sauce. The pizza is thin, light, crunchy. The crust is not heavy, super crispy and got a nice crisp on the bottom. I was impressed by how it stayed crispy for a long time, despite we have walked to our friend's place. - Cheese Pizza [GET]: Classic NYC slice at Joe's, cannot get wrong with this one. Similar to the Supreme, the pizza is thin, crust is crispy and got a nice crisp on the bottom. The cheese to sauce ratio is great. There's a great layer of cheese, just enough to get that slight cheese pull. It got the right amount of cheesiness and creaminess. It is not that salty compared to the Supreme slide. Perfect slide if you want a light late night snack. Ambiance: 4.5/5 - Multiple locations in NYC, and the original one being in Greenwich Village on Carmine Street. There are usually a long line here, but it moves pretty fast. It is a casual spot with limited seats, mainly stools and counter tops where you can stand and eat. Tons of pictures of famous people that have visited Joe's and a banner stating that Spider-Man was filmed at this location. Price: 4.25/5 - We got two big pies, one supreme and one cheese for around $60 total. Joe's Pizza is usually around $5 per slice, so prices are similar compared to other pizza stores in the area, besides 99 cent pizza, of course. It is definitely pricier than other pizza chains, but it's huge and definitely worth it. Service: 4/5 - It might look overwhelming and crowded, but the staffs are engaging and very welcoming despite how busy it is. The whole ordering process is efficient and fast, super seamless. We basically tell the staffs what we want, and the staffs in the kitchen will heat it up in the oven and hand it to us at the counter. You pay at the cash register. BLUF: I visit Joe's Pizza each time I'm in NYC, I just loved it so much. All the pies are delicious and you literally cannot go wrong with any slice. I recommend getting the Supreme or the Margarita and eat it there. Enjoying the life of being a New York City tourist while you are in NYC, LOL or a New Yorker. Lastly, if you order to go, they do not provide condiments, so make sure to get some red pepper flakes and Parmesan cheese before you head out."
25-Jul-22,"Overrated, the crust was crispy and the sauce was good but for the price was not worth $30 for 4 slices and two drinks."
25-Jul-22,Had to visit the famous Joes Pizza for a couple of slices. The line is out the door but worth it the pizza slice was big and the crust crispy just like I like it. The flavors were as I expected from a New York pizza joint authentic and delicious
25-Jul-22,"I've personally had better, line to long and tight space inside saw bugs. The pizza is mediocre defiantly not worth your time.  It's to greasy and poor service this is an easy skip for me. More better pizza places"
22-Jul-22,"Loved it so much we ate it twice our first day in NYC  Definitely worthy of the short wait, but after a long day walking around NYC their quick & friendly delivery at midnight was appreciated."
21-Jul-22,Pizza was very average. Nothing special at all. I buy Costco pizza more delicious than this. Another overhyped pizza spot
21-Jul-22,"The perfect slice of pizza. Crispy, hot, simple and flavorful. I recommend Joe's to anyone despite the short line up!"
21-Jul-22,AHHHMAZING! I love NY pizza and Joe's was absolutely worth the hype! If you're in nyc must go!!
19-Jul-22,"RIP OFF!!! The pizza here is okay but the prices and policies are not worth going to it.The pizza isn't any better than most other pizza places in the area. It survives on the hype and continued publicity.But, the prices are high and if you want a fresh from the oven pizza that they made to sell in slices they charge you between $9-10 more because they charge you for the 8 slices at the slice price versus the lower price for the whole pie because the slice pie is 9 inches and the whole pie they give people to takeoutbor eat in is just 8 inches. Tells you about their business practice, charge the whole pie price (around $34 plus tax, depending on topping) for a smaller pizza then they display and sell in slices."
18-Jul-22,"It's a necessity to get NY Style Pizza when I'm NYC, and Joes never disappoints. We had a whole pie with pepperoni!"
17-Jul-22,New York pizza is simply the best ... there are lots of good pizza places and Joes is one of them. Love the thin crust and all the various options.
17-Jul-22,"Legitimately some of the best pizza I've ever had. Not too oily, crunchy crust, solid crisp. All around great joint - cost me $9.75 for the two slices shown - a little on the pricier side for NYC pizza but not ridiculous. A must-have in NYC!"
17-Jul-22,"I wanted to see what all the rave was about.  They have long lines (about 30 minute wait), limited eat-in space, and walls of pictures with various celebrities or other well-known people.  But the pizza was pretty good.  I got two different slices (don't recall since I am writing this review 2 months after the fact).  But the prices are still reasonable ($4-$6 generally for a slice).  I figure lots of others have posted their pictures so no need to see mine (plus I didn't take any)."
16-Jul-22,"[Joe's Pizza] One of the most well known spots for NY pizza. They have an insane amount of locations even 3 locations in China (yes what) but this was the Broadway location. The original location being Greenwich Village in NY on Carmine St.Native New Yorkers will always says it's not Joe's it's another pizza place that's the best but hey I'm in NY I gotta give the infamous place a try. Dave Portnoy AKA Stoole Presidente gave different Joe's ratings but average was around a 7.9I'm not a pizza expert so it's on my foodie rating I'm gonna give Joe's a 8/10 We got the classic Pepperoni and the Sicilian  - Sicilian has more of a crunch to it they toast it a bit more when you order it Overall crazy good pizza best I've had. It's thin, crunchy but still got chewy textures and 10000% better than Chicago Deep Dish. I just wish it had more sauce and honestly I don't think $4ish dollars for a slice is that worth 1435 Broadway NY, NY 10018"
14-Jul-22,"I was craving some pizza after walking for a while at Times Square. This place did not do its justice. I am not sure if it's only this location or if it's this business in general. Anyway, I grab 4 slices: caprese, pepperoni, sicilian square pie & white pizza. I did not enjoy this place but I did eat the pizza because I was so hungry. The best slice was probably the caprese. The square pie was good, I wanted to try it for the first time as I never had it but if you want to eat extra carbs/dough this is for you. If not just get the pepperoni. And the white pizza was not even worth it, I took a bite and did not bother for the rest of it. The pizza did not hold its shape at all, every time I would pick up a slice it would just become limp and everything would fall off so I had to use 2 hands to hold all the weight. The crust was not crispy but the line was fast. They warm up your pizza in the oven when you order but mine was lukewarm."
14-Jul-22,This is in the theater industry. Always king lines during lunch but the lines goes by fast. There's memorabilia photos in the wall. Pizza is always crispy. Always tasty.
14-Jul-22,"There was a huge line when we walked towards it as we headed to Times Square, but it was definitely worth the wait! I was able to look through the souvenir shop next door as my family stood in line, so the time went by fast. I could smell the aroma of pizza baking, and it was enough to make me hungry!We ordered two slices of the pepperoni, and it was $10 total. They came out the oven piping hot, and that first bite was to die for. The pizza was thin, and the crust had a nice crisp at the bottom. The sauce was perfectly tangy and sweet, and everything else was great!Highly recommend if you're around the Times Square area."
12-Jul-22,"Recently visited NYC with kids. Ordered twice from joe's. Late night, very busy hour for them, but was surprised to received our order within 30 minutes. Lines are extremely long, so didn't go to the shop. Pie itself was delicious. I am not a pizza person myself but did try a slice because my kids were raving about it:) Their menu is good but online order was limited to few. Which is understandable as they are crazy busy. We are not a big fan of meat so only ordered cheese. Were happy about it but am sure that other pies are delicious too. Their pie size is huge. One was more than enough for 4 people."
10-Jul-22,"Really good and so packed. Service was great. You can order a gluten free cheese add toppings but you have to order a whole pie, 12"" I think. The crust kind of cracks and not the best gf crust but that's kind of a misnomer anyway.  It was still worth it."
10-Jul-22,"Joe's simply has delicious pizza. There's really nothing more to say. When people come to visit me in New York, I take them to Joe's!"
9-Jul-22,Horrible customer service!! the pizza was burned down when I went to return the cashier was very nasty rude!! Just don't come! This two guys need to learn some customer service skills!!
9-Jul-22,"Best pizza I had on this trip to NYC. I usually don't like pizzas with a crunchy bottom but if it's Joe's, I'd make an exception without hesitation any time. I had the Pepperoni, Margarita, and the combo slice. Their pizza slices had a nice thin crust and their tomato sauce was really good. Reviews on this place are legit. Great representation of New York pizza!"
7-Jul-22,worth the wait. Best pizza I ever had outside Italy. Loved all the pictures of some cool celebrities on the wall. Very good service!
5-Jul-22,It is just like any other New York style pizza. Nothing special besides maybe the fact that they're kinda faster than the others.
2-Jul-22,"Yum yum delicious yum. They get it right. Always a wait, but the line goes fast. What do the get? Crust and sauce. Both are excellent. Huge slices. My fav NYC slice of 'za!"
1-Jul-22,"Pizza is one of my favorite food group and I love how everyone in NYC always has a slice in their mouth! Joe's pizza is just around the corner from our hotel. Since eating space is limited there, we order 5 slices and took it back to our room to enjoy! They put it in a large pizza box and it smelled devine!Hubby and I shared pepperoni, caprese, sicillian, supreme, & spinach.  The line was out the door, but it moved quickly. They are very efficient in taking your orders and re-heating it back up in the oven so it's warm and crispy! I love the thin crunchy crust! It tasted fresh and delicious! Average price at $4.00 a slice is a steal in NYC!  I can't decide which one is my favorite but maybe the caprese is the most unique with the huge mozzarella pieces. Dee-licious!! One of our fav meal on our NYC trip!"
30-Jun-22,Iconic pizza place in Times Square. Went the first time I was in New York and always insist on coming back again. The line is always long but it moves quickly.
30-Jun-22,"This is literally the best NY style pizza in the world. You might have to wait in line, but it's worth it."
30-Jun-22,"Everyone always hypes up New York pizza, and I really think it's for good reason! This was one of my favorite spots that we ate at during our NYC trip.SERVICE: Line was pretty long around 2AM on a Saturday, but it went by fairly quickly. The whole process is pretty fast - order your slices, have them heat up in the oven, pay. AMBIANCE: Super close to Times Square and the theater district, so it's a convenient spot if you're sightseeing around the area. Super casual place with no seats, but there are some counter tops where you can enjoy your food.FOOD: SO BOMB! Compared to SF, the slices are FAT. The pizza crust was soft, yet still crunchy, and there was a perfect sauce to toppings to crust ratio. It definitely hit the spot after a night out. The white sauce with spinach was our favorite - rich and creamy without being too much!Also saw Camilla Cabello after her SNL performance. That was cool. Definitely coming back next time we're in NYC!"
29-Jun-22,Not a bad pizza.  More middle of the road.  Nothing that popped in your mouth stating got to have it.
28-Jun-22,I went at one in the morning mostly because it was one of the few pizza joints still open. The line was really long and immediately I regretted coming here and thought I was really dumb for waiting in line. But then when I ate the pizza all my regrets went away. It was really good and not just for 1 AM pizza. Would wait in line again!
28-Jun-22,"Highly popular place with long lines! Loved Caprese Pie, white could have been better."
28-Jun-22,Had a couple days in NYC and wanted the real deal - decided to stop by Joe's based on other reviews and was not disappointed. I liked it so much I ended up going back before I headed that the airport. Joe's NAILED the texture - the bottom of the slices were super crispy but without getting heavy or dry.
27-Jun-22,"After a night out in K-town, I decided to try Joe's Pizza for some late night drunchies. The line was out the door by the time I got there but it does move by quickly. When I got to the counter, I ordered the pepperoni, white, margarita, and the pepperoni, mushroom, onion pizza. Once you order, they heat up your pizza in their stone oven so it's nice and hot and ready for you to eat. If you're ordering to-go, they don't have condiments to give you so make sure you put all the cheese and chili flakes you want on your slices.The pizza def lived up to the hype even the crust was delicious too. All the flavors we got were super tasty. All the ingredients tasted fresh too. My favorites were the white and the pepperoni, mushroom, onion pizza. My only compliant was that the margarita had lots of tomatoes on it than I expected but it was still good!Overall, Joe's Pizza is def a top contender in my book for the best pizza in NY."
27-Jun-22,Fabulous meal topped by fantastic and very friendly servers. Had the chicken pasta and the sauces were fabulous and so delicious. The pizza was also excellent and the crust was perfect. Nice neighborhood atmosphere.  We loved it!
27-Jun-22,Solid pizza. Long lines and for good reason. Fun ambiance but was also full of tourists
27-Jun-22,"Very solid pizza, suuuuuper crowded and touristy. Loved the white pizza with spinach and garlic."
24-Jun-22,"Good, cheap pizza. Worth the wait (about 20 mins.) on a Thursday evening. We took it back to our hotel and ate it there as there's not much seating inside. Staff was friendly and place is a good quick fix."
23-Jun-22,Pizza is amazing. They are super busy but the line goes fast and they're so nice. We are there twice while in NYC.
22-Jun-22,"Such a fun experience and TRULY delicious pizza! We visited on a Friday night just past midnight, and the line was out the door for good reason. We made it to the ordering counter within 10 minutes of getting in line and we chose four slices (two caprese, one fresh mozzarella, and one supreme). They heat the slices up in their stone oven while you pay and then you get your hot and crusty pizza slices to go on either paper plates or in a box (you can ask for a box if you prefer that!)We ate two of our slices right away and they were so perfectly heated and the crust was crunchy and light at the same time. All the ingredients tasted fresh too! We took our other slices back to our hotel and ate it later, and it was still just as good. It's popular for good reason! SO worth the short wait! PS: this is the pizza shop featured in the beginning of SpiderMan 2, which they demonstrate with a sign on the wall!"
21-Jun-22,"Best cheap nyc slice in the city. Consistently amazing. This location tends to be much more crowded than others. I'd recommend going to union square, Wall Street, or village locations."
20-Jun-22,Great pizza and fast service. Came at 11pm on Thursday and there was a line out the door. A must try when in NYC.
20-Jun-22,"I went to Joe's Pizza to grab some pizza slices to-go. The line was long given that it was after lunch. However, the staff was quick in getting me my orders which I really appreciated. The pizza was delicious but I wished they have condiments to go."
19-Jun-22,If you want New York style pizza this is the place to go!!  The line was out the door but it went fast. Grab an extra slice because if you don't you will wish you had!!
18-Jun-22,"Quick service Enjoyed the slices, hot from the ovenPricing good and location easy accessible Nice selection and variety of pizza by the slice Would recommend as a go to than any others nearby"
18-Jun-22,"/)   /)(    )/ „Å•  „Å• ~  So idk what the hype is about nyc pizzas but I guess Americans never had a original napoleon pizza because that's the real deal. The pizza at joes was a bit sweet and not really sth that knocked me out. Again original pizza is really what will have you fall in love with pizzas. The dough was thin and nice I liked that, it was crispy. But other than that nothing really excited me. Not worth trying nyc pizza especially if you're from Europe :/ so sorry. I don't think it's joes pizza but just pizza here in general which was not up to my taste or what I'm used to."
15-Jun-22,"Best pizza so far!  The sausage, pepperoni, onion pizza was delicious with an excellent crust!  Fast and friendly service. Highly recommend!"
15-Jun-22,Service is super fast and the pizza itself was delicious! The only thing I'll say is that my spinach pizza barely had any spinach on it; but it was still delicious. The slices are huge so they definitely fill you up!
13-Jun-22,Might be great for regular folks but we're vegan and the whole pie that was kindly made for us was just meh. Way too many green peppers and yucky canned mushrooms. They don't have any vegan cheese like some other places do. We gave our expensive leftovers to a homeless woman. The guy at the counter was terrific and accommodating but the finished product wasn't very good.
13-Jun-22,"Well I tried out this place to see what the hype was about and it was pretty dang good! There is no seating on the inside, due to how busy this place is, but the line goes down quickly. There is however places to stand and eat at standing tables. The pizza is wood fired and very thin and crispy. Quality is great for pizza and taste is good. You can get full pizzas, but most people get it by the slice. Now I know what the hype is about."
12-Jun-22,"Came from Michigan for the weekend. In search of Authentic, Traditional NY pizzaEverything I read pointed to Joe's. It was late. I ordered a delivery, it was to the hotel in under 15 minutes.Steaming hot, and PERFECT!!!"
11-Jun-22,This pizza is delicious and flavorful. The pizza's a bit then but the slices are huge also very affordable. It's located next to Times Square so after dinner there's always something to see.
9-Jun-22,"Ahhh literally amazing pizza. My friends and I went here at midnight, and this was the first place we visited when we landed in NY. So yummy, love the vibe, and is overall a good slice of pizza! I miss it"
8-Jun-22,"My Step-Dad grew up in NY and always told me to go to Joe's, so I did on my first trip to NYC and now I always make it a point to stop by when I go back and pay homage to him. The pizza never disappoints and the place is always busy, pandemic or not.They added a parklet during my last visit, which was welcome considering how crowded it does get inside. Joe's Pizza has become my signal I've arrived in NY, kinda like El Farolito or Senor Sisig in San Francisco.Happiness."
8-Jun-22,True NY pizza. Get it and eat it standing at the counter outside. Pepperoni and cheese is my pick. Huge slices. Fair price.
7-Jun-22,"so this is what new york pizza is! great seasoning, great flavors, and overall a perfect slice. the line was a bit long when we came but we made our way through. would highly recommend for anyone searching for the perfect slice of pizza!"
7-Jun-22,Time square location is much bigger than the original. Still has just as long of lines with very little seating. Prices went up on the slices. Delicious NY style pizza! They burn through pizza here so it's always fresh they have a large crew or workers making the pizzas where you can see. Very awesome a worth the visit!
6-Jun-22,"Best combo pizza, or even best pizza, I've ever had! My boyfriend and I came here past midnight and the line was still out the door! It was a weekend night, so that makes sense. The ricotta on the spinach pizza was delicious, but the marinara sauce and meats on the supreme pizza really takes the spotlight. Everything on the supreme pizza complimented each other so well without anything being overwhelming. I loved how thin and crispy, yet cheesy and flavorful the pizzas were. Definitely an all time favorite."
5-Jun-22,Great pizza. Love the dough and the sauce. Ordered late night and was not disappointed. We had the fresh mozzarella pizza.
5-Jun-22,"I was under the impression this was supposed to be a really good pizza place. So after seeing a show we picked up a pepperoni pizza to take back to our room in our hotel. It was honestly one of the worst pizzas I ever had. There was hardly any cheese, the crust was tasteless, and the overall pizza was a disappointment. I mean, live and learn. I thought I would try something new, and I learned from the experience. To each his own, but I will never eat there again."
4-Jun-22,Was hungry.  Saw Joes Pizza.  Got in line which went outside door.  About 5 minutes later had a slice.  Good pizza. Not hungry anymore.
3-Jun-22,"Got a slice of white pizza and a supreme here last week, and I'm pretty disappointed. The white was really bland and I've had better and cheaper elsewhere. The supreme was fine, but nothing extraordinary. There are so many pizza places in NYC, and I personally won't be returning given my lackluster experience at Joe's."
2-Jun-22,"This place has great pies, they seem a little pricey at first but they are huge! The line was pretty long but the fast service got me through very quickly. Did I mention they are open late!"
1-Jun-22,"Joe's is a slice of HEAVEN! What a breath of fresh air to have quality food that doesn't break the bank out here in the city. I have come many times and appreciate the fresh ingredients, open kitchen concept, and efficient ordering process. The line is certainly worth it and moves quickly. What makes this pizza better than other pizzas is the tomato sauce-- clearly fresh and pure, none of the processed nonsense!Fresh mozzarella 5/5Pepperoni 5/5Cheese 5/5White pizza 5/5"
29-May-22,"My boyfriend's brother recently went to NYC, and he raved about Joe's Pizza when he was back. While my boyfriend and I walked around Times Sq., we thought we'd give him a run for his money. We were walking around Times Sq. at 10pm and saw quite the line outside of Joe's. From when we entered the line down the block it took about 30 minutes for us to finally get to the front of the line, which was not that bad at all. We also weren't hangry, so the wait was totally bearable. Plus the staff was very efficient with the ordering system. A staff member asks for your order and pops the slices in the oven far before you go to pay. This way, your pizzas will be warm and ready by the time you complete your transaction. We got a slice each of cheese, caprese, and pepperoni/mushroom/sausage/red onion. I tried the cheese and caprese, and they were solid. For 3 slices and 2 drinks (1 soda and 1 water) we paid $20.51, which I found to be a great deal for everything. When we got inside of the restaurant, I saw the big sign boasting that Joe's was in the OG Spiderman Movie where Peter Parker worked. I got the hype... Now, did it live it up to it? Sure! It wasn't the best NY style pizza I ever had, but it was still a classic slice of NY."
28-May-22,Best tasting pizza in NYC!!! The bottom of the pizza was super crunchy and good! Highly recommend if you are in the mood for a slice of good pizza
28-May-22,"Yes!!! My mom and I zipped in here after a Broadway show. There was a line out the door, but it moved it moved so quick! In and out within 10-15 min! Sat at nearby Bryant park and ate it! I preferred the cheese pizza to the pepperoni! Enjoy!"
28-May-22,I saw that this place was rated very high so I stopped by for a couple of slices with my girlfriend. The pizza was what I would call good for times Square pizza. I found it rather basic and the crust was hard and to thin for even NY style. Stop here if your in the times Square area. But if you'd like a really good piece of authentic NY style pizza go to Little Italy.
26-May-22,The quintessential New York slice. Don't sleep on the Sicilian either. Best slices in the city.
25-May-22,"My no one favourite on the New York City list is Joe's Pizza any one who visits NYC must try this once just a slice of the pepperoni or the plain cheese slice will just blow your mind love their unlimited cheese, garlic and chilli flakes dressing."
22-May-22,Delicious pizza by the slice or whole. Worth the wait!! Do not let the line deter you. It moves quickly and totally delicious! A must visit when in Times Square!!
21-May-22,"So good that we ate there TWICE during our 6 day visit! LOVED The food, and the staff were so kind and friendly.  This is an NYC MUST DO!"
20-May-22,I visited Joe's from Nebraska and ordered the pepperoni pizza. There was a 15 min wait but the line goes pretty fast and it's well worth the wait. Slices were $5/slice and a drink for $3. If you are visiting NYC from out of town Joe's is a must.  It's a historical icon of the city.
20-May-22,We had Joe's delivered to our hotel at 2:30am.  When it arrived it was still hot and delicious.  I would order Joe's again for sure.  Sorry there's not a Joe's where I live.  Some of the best Pizza I have had!!!
19-May-22,Great New York pizza recommended to me by a local. Worth the wait! Also great price worth it for the size of slice. I would go there again!
18-May-22,"I had heard about this place on many occasions. From Genie Bouchard's pizza meet and greet, to anyone I ever met from NYC. During my final hours, I went there to get a couple of slices to remember it well. I ordered two pepperoni and cheese and grabbed a corner with a bottle of ginger ale. I got my oregano and went to town sprinkling it all over. I stood there and slowly enjoyed them until it was over. The guys and gal behind the counter were super helpful and clearly work hard to make a damn good pizza."
17-May-22,I like their original location. This was bigger. There was huge crowd even at midnight which is expected given its so close to tine square. The staff messed our order quite a few times. We had to wait a long time to get the correct order. The supreme slice was okay. The mozzarella cheese slice seemed pretty old. They should put more mozzarella.
16-May-22,"Overall a 3.5/5. Good pizza but overpriced for the quality and rather greasy. Definitely a street pizza kind of taste. Mozzarella was good, crust was good. However, I would choose other pizzas in the city with so many to choose from."
16-May-22,Had this as takeout back at our hotel. The crust is too hard for my likings and too thin. The tomato sauce was not enough either. Definitely had better pizza in NYC.
15-May-22,"Very good pizza, especially liked the crunchy crust.  The toppings and tomato sauce were tasty."
12-May-22,Very friendly staff and pizza was delicious!  It was crowded be a it's fantastic but moves quickly. Several locals had recommended it as the best place for pizza. Generous size slices and very affordable.
10-May-22,"This place kind of really sucks for a NYC slice. I've been working in NYC for the past two months and our office has purchased pizza from here twice. Let me explain, the crust are decent but typically too charred and often fall apart. The underside of the pizza is rough, hard to chew through, thin but not crisp. The sauce is watery and runny which makes the cheese slide off. The cheese is pretty good. Save your money and find a different spot. Also, how are two large pizzas at $26.00 cheap or reasonably priced? My local shops near me charge $18-25 for specialty pizzas and at most $14-16 for a large cheese pizza."
8-May-22,"I don't really care that it's considered a tourist trap because I love their pizza!During my first trip to NYC, I had Joe's two days in a row. It was that good. You have to understand NY-style pizza though and I can see how some people may not love it (say, if you're from Chicago and a deep dish fan). The crust is super thin and the toppings are light. Since this location was near my hotel, it was convenient to swing by right as they were opening for no wait time at all. I have returned around dinner before and experienced the typical line, but as others have said it does move fairly quickly, for a reason - the service is not friendly. They're all about speed here, so don't dilly-dally! That's where I took off a star, otherwise this joint is a solid 5/5 for me.The supreme is my favorite because I love a mix of meat and veg in my pizza, but you can't go wrong with a caprese or fresh mozz either. When I make pizza at home, Joe's is what I strive to achieve. With all the locations around, I recommend making the stop for a slice. Note that like many other shops in the city, there is limited seating."
6-May-22,Excellent calzones! And the sauce is very tasty as well. I recommend Joe's to anyone in midtown Manhattan
5-May-22,"Although the one on Carmine is the OG, this Broadway branch around the Time Square strip was closest to us. This was the first stop on our ""pizza hopping"" journey since it seems very convenient and cheap. There was a bit of a line but it does move quickly. We got a single slice of Supreme pizza which is my go-to's growing up (gotta always get the max number of toppings!). Right away I was impressed by the first bite. The center was firm, chewy, and with just the right amount of crispiness. Many other places often undercook the center of pizza making it soggy and floppy, especially when it's a large one. And of course the rest of the slice was solid, with plenty of toppings that fully covered the entire slice. I was definitely craving for more after the slice was done, and given the great value that is worth the price, this place definitely will be my first pizza stop the next time I come back to New York!"
4-May-22,"One of two pizza places I stopped at because I seen a line down the block and around the corner so I said let's see what the hypes about. The inside walls was decorated with pictures of celebrities from over the years some other decor and was extremely busy. The pizza for me was okay I should have ate my slice straight from the window display but I didn't and they slapped it in the over for a sec giving it a crisp crust which I didn't care for . All slices except cheese range from 5.00 +depending on the toppings, Sicilian style ect. Definitely plenty of locations and VM lines out the door so someone likes them worth the try if ur a pizza fanatic."
3-May-22,"Loved the thinness of the pizza! We got pepperoni, white, & supreme! All so good and the line goes fast"
2-May-22,"Kind of pricey and touristy, but the pizza is hot, fresh, and tastes good. The inside was crowded but there is additional seating outside. Ooh yummy yummy pizza so yummy  Joe Mamas pizza LOL Pizza yu√º√ºm√ø√øy"
2-May-22,"Great pizza but I really don't think it's worth the wait. NYC has so many quality pizza spots to offer. The fact that this place is such a tourist trap and usually has a line out the door knocks it down a peg for me. The line does move fairly quick though. And that's not to say that the pizza isn't good, I just don't see myself waiting in line for a slice here. Got two slices, one Supreme Slice and another Spinach White Slice. Both were great and very filling. If you're in Time Square and doing your touristy thing then I wouldn't blame you for wanting to come here, but if you're in a rush there are other places that won't make you wait 30+ minutes for a slice."
1-May-22,"Solid NYC pizza place that's cheap and tastes great! I love myself the Sicilian, pepperoni or just regular cheese slice. All good, great for late night eats and any other time in the day."
30-Apr-22,A Times Square institution. Great place to pick up a  quick slice. Long line but it doesn't take that long. Standing room to eat near the entrance. Several vegetarian options.
29-Apr-22,"Visited Joe's from Spiderman. It's a quaint stand up or take-out kind of place. Staff was friendly, pizza options were good, cost is reasonable, music was great and it's a close walk to the action of Time Square. Go before or after lunch to miss the crowd and line."
29-Apr-22,"Came here because of all the reviews for the perfect NY slice. I had plain, kids had pepperoni, hubs had sausage and red onions. We all have this place a thumbs up! It's classic pizza, right level of cheese, tang from sauce and oil dripping onto our plates. Line was out the door which was expected but they move very fast like a well oiled machine. Being from NYC I will say there are plenty of other great hole in the wall pizza places that are just as good. Remember there is no seating here, all standing only so be prepared."
28-Apr-22,"I went to visit NYC back in March and had to try the iconic Joe's Pizza. We had some time before our broadway show, and this location was so close to the Minskoff Theatre. We ordered a whole pizza with half pepperoni and half supreme. I was very underwhelmed by the supreme slices but the pepperoni slices were out of this world! I would recommend sticking to the classic flavors of cheese & pepperoni, and you won't be disappointed!"
28-Apr-22,"Classic spot to grab pizza in Manhattan. There are a few locations in the city, and this location is near Times Square. I went here on a weekend night, and there was a line that extended outside the spot. It took about 15 minutes to get to being able to order. There are quite a few pizzas to choose from ranging from white to regular and more. I chose one white ($5) and one regular ($4). A whole pie of any given pizza is over $20. There has been an increase in price as regular slices were previously under $4. The pizza was ready relatively quickly, and there was enough space inside to stand and eat the pizza slices. I was not impressed by the white pizza because it lacked flavor, but the regular slice was as good as I remembered. One thing that could have made the experience was if the pizza had been left in the oven a little longer as it got cold quite quickly. Overall, a fun spot to grab pizza especially late at night (it closes at 5AM). I went earlier in the evening by myself, but I could see that it would be great for groups. Definitely a place to grab some New York pizza, and enjoy it in a lively setting."
26-Apr-22,"Of course we had to stop when we saw a line at this little place. It turned out to be an outpost of Joe's in Greenwich Village! Good thing we were hungry! The line moved fast. The staff was very efficient. No seating but lots of counter space and high top tables. We grabbed a couple of plain slices and stood at a high top. The slices were hot! The pizza was so good with a thin crust, slightly sweet sauce and lots of cheese. A variety of slices as well as whole pies are available.  Refrigerated coolers with different soda are available."
26-Apr-22,"Best tourist trap pizza I ever had. Amazing!Don't be discouraged by the lines, they go by fast. This pizza joint was located near our hotel, in the heart of time square. There is a square outdoor standing only covered area to eat and go, but this is not a sit down establishment, just pay and go.The pizza is large, greasy (in a good way :), thin, flavorful, cheap. I don't know if it's the pizza sauce or the dough, but I am sort of glad I am not from here, cause I can eat that everyday. We all tried one of each and it did not disappoint, my favorite was the caprese pizza.Believe the hype, it's good!"
25-Apr-22,"This place is always busy and has a long line but I'm pretty sure it'll be worth the wait. This place has the best crispy yummy NY style pizza and as recommended by all, I also do the same."
25-Apr-22,"Is it 2am and you're absolutely hammered from a night out? This will be pure happiness on a paper plate. Crispy bottom, nice and thin, delicious greasy pizza. I couldn't actually tell you the flavors of the pizza other than good because this pizza is meant to be eaten straight out of the bars. Idk if I would recommend it sober, but give it a shot. Thanks Joe's"
24-Apr-22,This place is everything you asked for NY pizza. Love the size and the thin crust and how crispy it is. This is not the first time I have it but it still blows me away. My bf even said he can have it every day lol. This is also a perfect location for a touristy area. We're planning to go back to get more of it soon in other flavors.
24-Apr-22,"Joe's is my favorite! Skip the dollar slice!Never disappointed, ALWAYS busy.We didn't get there til after 11pm Saturday night and there was a big line outside. Luckily I decided to pre-order online (they use ChowNow) and was able to walk right in, tell the guy at the register I had a pick up order and left all within 5 minutes!Save yourself from starving in line while smelling all the pizza and order ahead!"
24-Apr-22,Took my Scouts to eat pizza after camping at West Point.  They all gave a thumbs up for the pizza! Definitely a must at sometime during your visit to the City.
21-Apr-22,"Eh. Do not get the hype at all.I had high hopes for NYC pizza but this was not it. Paid $5 for a lukewarm pizza - the cheese was barely melted from the 30s of reheating... I also found the pepperoni to be extremely salty.There was sparse seating and parmesan/chili flakes that you could add to your pizza slice, but even that couldn't save it for me. Perhaps the only redeeming quality was the thin chewy crust. My friend also pointed out that NYC pizza has a thinner layer of marinara sauce, felt neutral about that.Would not recommend unless you are hungry and need the convenience factor."
21-Apr-22,"Delicious pizza by Times Square. My kid wanted to come to NYC to eat NY-style pizza, and Joe's consistently popped up on a few ""Best Pizza in NYC"" lists. I had a fresh mozzarella pizza slice. Crust was thin, crispy, and just the way I liked it. Did we need to come all the way to NYC for a slice? No. But was it good? Yes."
18-Apr-22,"Honestly the best pizza I've ever had. The line is always long, which shows how great it is. Delicious. Quick service. Good price. What else can you ask for???"
17-Apr-22,"PERFECTI know everyone and their brother has ""the"" pizza place you gotta go in NYC.  Whatever, this place is fucking perfect, thin, delicious crispy crust and toppings.  We always get a new flavors between the four of us and I always wish I just got the plain cheese.  It's just perfect pizza.If you're in manhattan looking for a great slice on the go, this is a guaranteed win."
13-Apr-22,Fantastic!  Maybe a little of a tourist trap!  Photos of celebrities visiting the place!  The pizza is the real deal though!  Great sauce and huge slices!
13-Apr-22,If you are looking for authentic New York style pizza this is it. Sure some might complain that it's been too commercialized and it's not cool anymore. I don't care what they say. The reason this place always has a line is because it's good and simple. You can't visit NY and not have this great pizza.There are no tables to sit on. Like most places in NY you have to eat standing up or on the go. There may be a huge line but it moves quickly.
12-Apr-22,10/10 worth waiting for. I'd get this pizza everytime I am in NYC if I could!!
11-Apr-22,"Coming from Chicago, I know I had to go to at least one pizza Parlor and have good pizza. Surprisingly the one that someone recommended wasnt Joe's and I wasnt a fan of. However there is enough shops in Times Square to find a good pizza slice. Ladies and gentlemen, its here. The New York style slice was done really well! I had the pepperoni and wish I just got a whole pizza to myself. Sauce was on point, pepperoni wasnt overload but enough to have some in every bite, and the crust was New Yorker-singed to a burn, but not burnt. I was able to even fold it and experience NY pizza the right way. Definitely recommend this place and will go back."
11-Apr-22,"I'm a bit baffled about my cheese pizza. I read the reviews. My cheese pizza should've been really good. And even if it was mediocre, still should've been completely stellar because it's cheese pizza in New York. But the crust and cheese were both bland. It was pretty disappointing. Maybe just the random bad batch."
8-Apr-22,"exactly what you're looking for when you're in search of a NYC slice, excellent service, hardworkers, blasted all expectations through the roof"
6-Apr-22,"The line is daunting, but I was really happy we were able to try Joe's Pizza. My boyfriend and I tried a slice of the white pizza, supreme, and fresh mozzarella. I thought that the white pizza was a little too salty and the supreme was pretty good. My favorite was the fresh mozzarella. I wish we had ordered a whole pie of the fresh mozzarella! It was thin and crispy. It was actually thinner than I had expected. I was pretty impressed. The sauce added a really nice sweetness and was not overpowered by cheese. I really wanted another slice before our trip ended, but it didn't work out. We tried to stop by before our flight home, but sadly no pies were ready at 10am. I will definitely come back for a slice of the fresh mozzarella the next time I'm in NY!"
3-Apr-22,"Amazing pizza even better service! My first slice was slightly burned (still edible and delicious) and without even having to ask, the man gave me an extra slice free. 100% worth a visit!"
2-Apr-22,"There was a small line when we arrived but it moved quickly. I got a caprese and my friend got the supreme. We throughly enjoyed our pizzas. The slices were big, the crust was thin but not overly thin. There were small containers of toppings (crushed pepper, oregano etc) for customer use. Definitely recommend to try."
1-Apr-22,"Great pizza! After an evening show, expect a line out the door, but it moves quickly. They have the pizza coming out constantly, hot and yummy!"
30-Mar-22,"Great slice pie stop. Busy but quick service. Fresh pies coming out of the ovens constantly. Limited standing counter space. Favorite celebrity stop, pictures on the walls to prove it."
29-Mar-22,"Great tasting pizza. Visited here two times in two weekends and they kept up with their amazing taste. Can't wait to come back and enjoy a few slices of their pizza. The crust was a little burnt, but still fantastic!"
29-Mar-22,"My favorite pizza place in NY and maybe the world. Worth the wait if you can't make it to one of the other locations. Always in awe of how efficient the restaurant is run and how quickly they can get so many people through the line. With such high demand, it would be easy to let quality slip, but Joe's just doesn't seem to falter."
28-Mar-22,The pizza was good.  As busy as they were the service was fast.  I can't say if the pizza was the best that I have tried but overall it was good.  We do have New York style pizza in Los Angeles that blows them out of the water.   Overall it was a good experience.  Would I tried it again? Maybe.
27-Mar-22,"It doesn't get better than joes pizza!  Worth waiting in line for the best pizza NYC has to offer.  A great selection and the crispy crust was better than we had anticipated.  A ""must eat"" if your in the city!"
25-Mar-22,"We were visiting for NY for my wife's birthday, and were looking for good pizza along the way while we walked to the Empire State Building. A couple in Bryant Park overheard us and directed us to Joe's Pizza a block over - and it did not disappoint! We wanted the NY pizza experience and this place is it. It was crazy packed, but it moves quickly. No sitting around and relaxing here, meant as a grab and eat quickly or a grab and go. Worth it. The pizza is the perfect mix of crunchy and chewy pizza dough, and didn't have too many toppings to where it wouldn't hold up. So so so delicious. Go and grab some asap!"
25-Mar-22,"I saw Bobby Flay post about this location and make a recommendation.. So when I realized they opened a location in the Broadway/Times Square area I was so excited! This is the perfect place for a classic, thin crust, greasy, cheesy New York slice. I went on a Wednesday evening after I got out of an 8 PM show and there was a line out the door. It still moved fairly quickly. I got a plain slice for $4, so good. Exactly what I expected. There were plenty of people though that came out with whole pies! The place is pretty small, only a few small high top tables and counter areas to stand at but it's perfect for grab and go. And they're open late! While this location isn't on the main road, not near the bright lights of Times Square and the Broadway theaters, it is not far at all. I would recommend passing the other knock-off type chains and visiting this established location for an authentic slice."
25-Mar-22,"Super overrated, it's only famous because of all the TV and movie references to it! Legit any other place would've been equal or better!"
23-Mar-22,Loved the pizza!  Here for only 5 days already been there twice. White pizza is great. Fresh mozz pizza was a treat. Traditional pepperoni was very good.
20-Mar-22,Ignored by staff because the server a friend first .Happened multiple times.Probably happens all the time
20-Mar-22,"We went on recommendation to this place. There are many neat photos of celebrities eating Joe's pizza on the walls. Looks like they were taken at a different Joe's location. I had a slice of pepperoni. The sauce was bland compared to other pizza we have had on this trip. The margarita pizza, the tomatoes and mozzarella were still somewhat cold. The serving model is order your slices, they toss them in the oven to warm and hand them back when you pay. So they are in the oven for 1-2 minutes. Not enough time to heat back through. It was ok."
17-Mar-22,"Loved the pizza, the vibe and overall experience. I would definitely come back here for a good ol fashion, greasy slice of New York pizza!"
16-Mar-22,"Typical but very good NY pizza. Always a favorite quick bite while walking around Times Square. Line is always long but worth the wait. I recommend getting a whole pie if more than 2 people because a whole pie somehow looks and tastes better than a slice...  yes, ther√©s a hint of implication there that it's by design(?)!!!!"
15-Mar-22,DELICIOUS! I loved the crust and I eat a lot of pizza. Fast service and yummy food. By the slice or whole pie.
14-Mar-22,Great pizza for a good price. I recommend getting a box of pizza. Also for spider man lovers this place is just a little bit cooler.
14-Mar-22,Pizza delivery fast and late at night excellent pizza and delivered right to my door on the 43rd floor
13-Mar-22,Kind of hard to give a rating when I never received the order. After a call to Joe's as well as grub hub. Resulted in a cancelation and refund.
13-Mar-22,"Yum perfect for a quick bite. They even reheat the pizza for you! Very thin crust and very tasty. Got the white sauce with spinach and garlic and a pepperoni. Quick, easy and delicious!"
11-Mar-22,We found Joe's by chance when we got hungry late at night. Outstanding pizza even at midnight. OMG... That's unbelievable!
10-Mar-22,"Asked for mushroom, they said ""no"". Pie was burnt - both slices. Long line. Wouldn't do it again. More of a novelty"
10-Mar-22,"Just a solid NY style pizza. What else can I say?I got the cheese (or ""plain"" as the locals call it) and the flavor is good, and the texture is very good. However, nothing that was special, per say. I'll definitely be going back to try the other pizzas."
6-Mar-22,"Joe knows pizza. Even after all these years, people wait in line for one of the original pizza bosses. Undercarriage is always perfect. Real cheese. Real sauce. Real dough."
6-Mar-22,First time! Total Chicagoan so you already know how we are about pizza. The lines were loooonnngggg  but you can't even feel it. In and out! The pizza has the superior crispy crust. I could bone with the regular cheese.
6-Mar-22,"Slice is decent, but it's the decor/vibes that really do it for me. Recommend eating at the shelf/countertop outside to people watch!"
5-Mar-22,"Let's just say this is my go-to place whenever I visit NY! Ever since my best friend said to try out this place, it's been my favorite place when I want pizza!The place is a bit tiny to eat inside because it's crowded but you can eventually find space considering people seem to eat pretty quick and leave or take their food outside or take it for takeout. The line can sometimes go outside and can be like a 5-10 min wait at around 10pm on the weekend but it's definitely worth the wait! I usually get pepperoni pizza and get a second slice if I'm super hungry. I definitely love this place and it's worth eating here if you want some good pizza. I would recommend trying it out considering it's pretty close to Time Square."
5-Mar-22,"It's a little tough to find great pizza in southeast Virginia. A lot of places talk about having NY style, but they have no idea what they're song with the ingredients. So when in Manhattan, we got our much needed pizza fix. And Joe's is about the best place to get it. Perfect large slice. Thin, crispy and chewy crust, good quality sauce and cheese, fresh toppings. And the staff is awesome. They have such a small space, but they are so fast and organized with taking the order and slamming those slices in the oven. 27 bucks for 4 slices and 2 bottles drinks isn't cheap, but hey, welcome to Times Square!"
5-Mar-22,"When in New York, ya gotta have New York-style pizza, so I heard Joe's Pizza was a good spot for it.  And it certainly was.  It's the kind of pizza slice that's reliable, affordable and solid, so I can see why people are fans. We visited Joe's Pizza on a Sunday night, and the place had a short line; but it went by swiftly.  Although the shop itself is on the smaller side, many people were getting takeout, and there was also a heated, covered outdoor dining area that many people were eating their slice at, so we didn't have an issue finding a countertop to eat at.  I saw many takeout orders of whole pies going out.  It was a popular spot, especially since it's located in Times Square.I ordered a slice of the supreme pizza, which the staff warmed up.  It was a good slice of pizza, with sausage, pepperoni, mushroom and red onions.  Not much to this pizza; but I say, simple, classic pizzas hardly ever get it wrong.  Was it the best pizza I've ever had?  Well, no.  But it was good - and it was floppy enough for me to fold, which gives it the signature NY-style pizza flair.  I dig it."
4-Mar-22,"We came here for late night food after the bars! This is my friend's favorite spot for pizza, and she's local to Manhattan. I can understand why. At 3am, this place had a long line out the door, but it went quickly. We got a GIANT pizza to split, and they were able to accommodate half cheese and half supreme. So good. The three of us splitting the pizza still had a fourth of the pizza for leftovers, it's gigantic. Great spot for late night food in NYC!"
1-Mar-22,"I stopped by here with a friend visiting from out of town and the line was out the door for good reason! We ordered a large supreme pizza and ate it standing up by the window. The pizza came out piping hot and was delicious! The crust was thin, and it was covered with pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage, and onions. It's crowded, but people finish quickly and make room for others coming in. There are a ton of photos on the wall of well known people who have visited this spot, and also a banner that it's featured in the spider-man movies."
28-Feb-22,"This is our go-to delivery option for a cheese pie. Classic NYC style, thin crust, tasty sauce, it always hits the spot. One of the best traditional NYC style cheese pies around, and affordable ($21-$23 for a large pie I think)"
27-Feb-22,"Joe's never fails to deliver, great pizza great choices but don't think you can sit to eat as it is always crowded.  Good atmosphere, friendly staff and very good pricesDefinite recommend"
27-Feb-22,Was a very enjoyable evening was busy yet service was prompt and on time food was delicious as always came out hot this is one of our favorite go-to's really enjoyed ourselves last night thank you so much
27-Feb-22,"The absolute most amazing pizza in NYC!!! It was phenomenal, delicious & cheesy!!! The line was out the door and down the street but it went fast."
25-Feb-22,"Quick service, great variety, and yummy pizza! So happy we tried it! We'll be back when we are back on the island!"
25-Feb-22,A trip to NYC is not completed without coming here. Recommended by Spiderman. Say less. 11/10.
24-Feb-22,"My fave! I have been here three times and the pizza is consistently hot and delicious. Went this past weekend and although there was a line, it wasn't as long as other times I have visited. The line always moves quickly. We were able to take our pizza to Bryant park and sit and eat. It was still hot. Yes it was cold out but those 2 slices made it well worth it."
24-Feb-22,"Fast and friendly, probably my favorite pizza in New York City.  Several locations to choose from."
20-Feb-22,"We spent a full day of our NYC trip walking around, trying and comparing pizzas around the city. It's safe to say Joe's remains our favorite because just when we thought we were all pizza'd out... we stopped by for seconds at their other location on our way to the airport lol! The service is great, pricing is fair and the pizza is always piping hot and delicious. Even when we brought the pizzas back to our hotel and they weren't steamy hot anymore they were still delicious! I have nothing negative to say about our visits to both locations."
20-Feb-22,"When I think of NY style Pizza, I think of Joe's Pizza. The slices are big, thin, burnt just right on the bottom, and taste amazing. Definitely the go-to for quick counter service slices of pizza in the city of NY!"
20-Feb-22,Soooo good. Best pizza in New York! Super big slices. Wish I had more. Not that expensive either
18-Feb-22,"Best pizza in New York. Thin crust, pepperoni covered.Piping hot and fresh.  They crank them out as fast as they can.  The line is out the door even at 2:00 pm But you won't wait long in the line.Definitely a must have if you are near Times Square."
18-Feb-22,"Great place for pizza by the slice near Times Square. Pizza is hot, delicious and reasonably priced. Long line, but fast and efficient service. The tomato-mozzarella and the ""Works"" pizza we're both great.  $4.50 for large slice!"
15-Feb-22,"Always a classic. What makes Joe's so good really is their sauce, more than just tomato sauce, it's so flavorful and yummy and they make plain cheese taste so good! There's a reason Spiderman reps them"
10-Feb-22,Can't miss the famous Joe's Pizza when traveling to NYC! This place is the absolute best and open late for a nightcap. The cream soda is great too.
10-Feb-22,"The infamous Joe's Pizza just had to be our first eats of New York. Was this place overhyped? Most definitely. Had their Supreme Pizza and it was decent, it had pepperoni, red onions and mushrooms which is also a good combo. Honestly just tasted like a pizza to me and nothing really special not incrediably exciting about it. A bit too much on the chewy side if anything. Also tried a bit of their Caprese and it wasn't too bad, cheese was good but I'm not a fan of tomatoes so probably just not for me in general. This spot is small and pretty damn close to Times Square so prepare yourself for a line and taking it else where to eat because it could get crowded!"
8-Feb-22,Amazing establishment! Worth the wait for every bite. I went at 2am and the line was out the door in the rain but it moves so quickly and efficiently. Definitely hyped up but so good!
7-Feb-22,"I appreciate how thin the crust is! Definitely had to fold it taco style to fit it in my mouth. I used to be a pepperoni hater, but I'll make an exception for Joe's."
5-Feb-22,Really disappointed had the margarita with meatballs.  There was hardly any cheese on it and the meatballs tasted overly processed.
5-Feb-22,"YOU (yeah you) are  already walking distance from Times Square so why not try out Joe's Pizza? I, myself was hesitant to check out such a touristy spot (even though I'm a tourist) , but walking in and seeing ""As seen in Spider-Man"" you simply have to get a NY slice. The line is typically long, but the curt workers keep the line moving so you're never waiting for too long. The have several toppings, but my group went with individual slices of cheese, pepperoni, and mozzarella. The slices are huge and  absolutely delicious. A member of my group easily inhaled 3 slices back to back. I believe Joe's is an excellent starting point for trying out pizza in NY, but i recommend trying as many places as you can. We also had a pizza delivered to our hotel and the crust had burn spots so beware of that if your'e getting it delivered. Joe's is pretty scrumptious though. Tell them Dominique sent you...and nothing will happen."
4-Feb-22,"Honestly, we had a few other pizza places lined up as we were trying to avoid the obvious tourist traps. Alas, I found Joe's Pizza on Yelp with stellar reviews. Being not too familiar with Manhattan, I didn't realize that this is pretty much in the heart of Times Square (I hate Times Square BTW). So we hopped on the subway and made our way here to be greeted with a pretty long line. We were hungry so we decided to wait it out. I had my doubts, but ultimately I was in for a surprise. THEY'RE ACTUALLY VERY GOOD!They offer a number of meat and veggie options by the slice so I decided to try their White Pie (with spinach) and the fresh mozzarella pie. The crust was perfectly thin and crunchy without being too soggy from the toppings or too crispy. If you don't mind the wait, I recommend you to try this place!"
1-Feb-22,"Came here after eating some really bad ramen and Joe's literally saved the night! First time trying NY pizza and we got the cheese and supreme. The pizza is so thin, cheesy, and yummy. I loved both of them! The line went by really fast and we just ate it outside right away. The 2 slices costed around $8 which was not too bad in my opinion. Great for a quick late night bite."
31-Jan-22,Did you really come to NY if you didn't get a slice? I'm not big on pizza but NY style is probably my favorite because of its simplicity and the thin dough making the pizza crispy.The pizza itself were good so that takes care of my pizza craving for a long while.Price is high though but stuff were friendly
24-Jan-22,A tourist stop so expect long lines. We ordered pepperoni and sausage mushroom slice - $3/4 per slice. The crust was thin and had a good oven toasty flavor. The pizza was not overloaded with cheese. Overall the wait was worth it.
24-Jan-22,"Lots of options available, got the pepperoni and 4 cheese pizza slices, both were pretty tasty."
23-Jan-22,This was a welcome surprise. A little pricey but yummy food! We will add it to our list for New York adventures
22-Jan-22,"The holy trinity of pizzas is what I got here so good, crust baked to perfection and each ingredient put together on a pie was amazing. I'm not a crust eater but I ate the whole slice and enjoyed each and every bite !"
20-Jan-22,"My brother and I opted for slices of cheese pizza at Joe's Pizza after watching Lion King at the Minskoff Theater. It always hits the spot! This Joe's Pizza is located near the theater district in Time Square. It's about a 5 minute walk from the theaters.  Don't let the lines deter you. It moves relatively quick! A slice of cheese pizza will run you about $3.25/slice and it's well worth it! This NY style pizza has the perfect ratio of cheese, sauce and crust.Happy eating!"
20-Jan-22,"Went here for the fun of visiting the Spider-Man pizza shop while in NY. Although the line was LONG, they were so fast and the pizza was nothing short of great!"
17-Jan-22,"The best pizza EVER!!!!My son had found this place because it was recommended by some YouTubers so we went to check it out. The line was out of the door! The line moved really quick though. You know the pizza is good when everyone is standing and eating the pizza because they just could not wait to enjoy the pizza. The walls are covered in pictures of celebrities that have eaten there which was really cool. This place is literally the definition of a ""Hole in the Wall"". It's tiny with the best pizza. The pizzas sold are the same price as chain pizza restaurants. I recommend their speciality which is cheese pizza. We ordered a whole pie of cheese pizza and my husband, two kids and I finished it within 10 minutes. It was so good.It's the best pizza ever. Do yourself a favor and just go!"
14-Jan-22,"I strolled by this pizza spot one day and was amazed by the long line at this establishment! My bf raved to me about this spot and that it was one of his favorite pizza spots..so naturally I had to try it out for myself to see the hype! I'm not a big fan of lines at all and I'm sure no one likes to wait - but if I hear that these pizza slices are the best in town, you'll see me happily waiting in that line patiently. The mozzarella slice was so worth the wait y'all..Let me tell you, from the perfect ratio of cheese to sauce to the thinness of the crispy crust and freshness..wow! I finished up my slice and was already thinking about coming back next time to order me a whole pie. The staff at this establishment are all super friendly and efficient. They knew how to keep the line moving and are super quick. I can't wait to come here again!"
13-Jan-22,"This place does NOT disappoint when you're craving a slice of New York pizza. Piping hot and super quick - this hit the spot for a 10am breakfast / lunch (or really good for any time in the day). Thin crust, just the right amount of sauce (was bit too much on the sweeter side for me), and hot cheese on top. I got a slice of pepperoni and mozzarella and inhaled both. A contender for my favorite pizza place in NYC."
13-Jan-22,"Delicious! We ordered a full pie and it was hot and made to order (obviously). We got half mozzarella and half combo. The slices are huge, crust is thin, plenty of toppings. New York means New York pizza and you can't go wrong with Joe's pizza!"
12-Jan-22,"Pizza snack after an entire day exploring NYC? YES PLEASE. This place was recommended to me by friends and it did not disappoint at all !Many reviews mention a long wait/line, but since it was already 8:30pm , maybe the dinner rush was done! We waited only about 20 minutes for our piping hot slices of cheese and margherita pizza. I loved the fresh slices of tomato and mozzarella on the margherita and the thin crust of the pizza. We honestly ate our slices of pizza so fast hence my attached blurry photo I had to screenshot from my Instagram story. The pizza was too delicious to wait to take multiple photos.If you're coming to visit NYC then stop by Joe's for your pizza craving!"
12-Jan-22,"After a recent visit to New York, I knew I had to try some pizza that was bigger than my head. I came across this restaurant not too far from times square. The line was almost out the door but the staff seemed to move lightning fast. The pizza was actually huge and pretty filling but was pretty burnt which was pretty disappointing. There's also about 5 ""Joe's Pizza"" in Manhattan so I am not sure how high this one ranks. All in all, I enjoyed trying out some authentic pizza and appreciate the pace of work the staff had, but wished there could have been some quality control so the pizza was more high quality."
10-Jan-22,"quintessential new york slices! they've got a ton of options in their display and the ordering process is speedy. there are counters and high tables around the restaurant where you can stand and eat. great spot for a quick lunch, their white slice is to die for! the walls are lined with photos of celebrities who have visited, you need to go here at least once!"
10-Jan-22,This place is amazing! Was walking down the strip and asked an officer whats the closest pizza place that's good. He recommended Joe's pizza which happen to be the famous one starred in the Spider man Movie. He did warn me that there might be a long line. I took my chances and got lucky! There was no line and was greeted by the staff. They are all so hardworking and the cashier was very friendly and funny! It takes you back through memory lane with all the famous celebrities that have stopped by here. Pizza was amazing! The mushrooms however did have a weird smell to it but overall great experience. This is a must go to place if youre in the area!
10-Jan-22,Great pizza but gotta eat whileIt's fresh out of the oven but it does reheat nicely in toaster mode in a toaster oven
5-Jan-22,Great New York style thin crust pizza  I had the fresh mozzarella one and it tasted soooo good. The crust was crispy
4-Jan-22,I have to say this is my favorite place for pizza when I visit NY! We are from Texas and always hear all pizza is good in NY but this is my go to for sure! Definitely worth the wait in line and great service too. We ate there  probably every day  while we were visiting
3-Jan-22,The pizza was good! Friendly staff and the inside is nice. I think this place is a tad overrated. I have found better slices in the city but still really good pizza!
2-Jan-22,super highly rated and lives up to the hype! the Sicilian slice was to die for but the regular slices were just as good. highly recommend for anyone who goes to nyc!
2-Jan-22,"I recently traveled to New York and stayed at the Luma Hotel just down the street.  My friend and I ordered Joe's pepperoni pizza twice during my short trip.It was delicious and definitely met all expectations of typical New York pizza.  The crust was just a little tough to bite through, but might just be something to get used to.  Still delicious!!!"
2-Jan-22,"Classic. Having lived in Florida the last 4 years and California for 9 years before that, the first stop I made when in NYC was for a slice of NY style pizza.  Not sure there is a better place to get a quintessential slice than Joe's Pizza right next to time square. There was a line, but it moved quickly. The pizza was being hand tossed and fresh out of the oven. I told my 11yo son that pizza in NYC was just different. I taught him the ""fold"" and how to properly eat the slice. The crispy yet chewy crust was something you can't get anywhere else. Extraordinary. Perfect amount of cheese and perfect amount of sauce. Highly recommend joes for a classic NYC slice or pie."
1-Jan-22,"There's no better pizza than Joe's! We waited about 30 minutes in line, and once we got to the front, we placed an order for two slices of pepperoni at $15. It came out hot and crispy and we grabbed a small spot to eat at the standing counter. I had to come by again the next day to grab another slice because it was just so delicious!"
31-Dec-21,"That crust!! I think that's what makes Joe's pizza so good. Hot, fresh slices. Can't go wrong."
31-Dec-21,"Love this spot. Aside from it being a tourist attraction and always packed with people during the holidays, it's great. The pizza is ALWAYS fresh never reheated. Everything is really good so far that I've tried. Workers are cool, food is great, lines suck.With that being said ORDER ONLINE and just stay in line. Trust me best tip is order online and just wait there. You can end up getting a slice at the counter and a full pie when its ready."
30-Dec-21,"Overrated. Pizza was bland. Bread is a like cardboard, marinara sauce was bland. There are much better places in NYC."
30-Dec-21,"Service was fast, customer service fantastic and pizza super GOOD! We all got slices with different toppings. I personally got the ricotta cheese and spinach and I have to say BEST PIZZA!! You have to give it a try!! Really good, we all liked it!! My family was happy!!"
30-Dec-21,"BEST PIZZA in NYC hands down. Came in here with my wife and kids, order 2 pies and they were DELICIOUS AND AMAZING! Will be stopping back by next time I'm in town. Come check out this hit spot for the BEST NYC STYLE PIZZA."
29-Dec-21,"It's okay.. skip the line, walk 10 minutes to Pizza Suprema and you'll have much much better NY pizza without the wait. Very overrated, there's just a lot better pizza in the city. Crust didn't have that flavor you look for in NY pizza. But it's okay, they just churn the pizza out cause it's so busy.. very touristy :( if my 2 local spots in Jersey have better pizza, that says something about this place!"
28-Dec-21,The pizza here is delicious and they are open late for that snack after a day of exploring
27-Dec-21,The outside is easy to locate with big signs on a corner.  Place was hopping and had a great vibe.  Workers were busy and welcoming.  I had a slice of cheese as I am going around Manhattan for 3 days on a pizza blitz trying as many slices as I can.  Pizza was average for NY for my tastes and had a good balance of sauce to cheese.  Sauce was on the sweet side and dough had more chew than I prefer.  I think they could have left the slice in the oven a couple more minutes and would have made it crispier.  There wasn't a line so not sure why they rushed me through.  Made the experience feel more touristy than I like.  I rated my experience and pizza as average.
27-Dec-21,"Even though they were featured in Spider-Man, don't count this place out as a tourist trap. It's a solid 3.5 stars. Expect swift NY counter service and quick slices out the oven. This also means that some of the slices might not be properly heated, but the crusts are still perfectly crunchy and soft. The cheese is always the way to go, as it's the cheapest and you can't beat the classics, especially with this one's perfect hint of sweetness from the tomato sauce. The supreme is whatever, so maybe you skip that, but a couple slices of the original and you'll be happy."
23-Dec-21,The cheese pizza is really good here. Tomato sauce is light and mixed well with the cheese. Worth the wait and will definitely come back!
23-Dec-21,I ordered this pizza because i heard it was very good. I ordered a square pie with pepperoni and it was horrible. I was craving a nice Sicilian square and this was a huge disappointment. I will never be ordering from here again.
23-Dec-21,Simply the best slice of New York style thin crust cheese pizza. The topping is blistered and bubbling with cheese and tomato sauce. The crust is toothsome and sturdy enough not to drip any oil on your shirt.
22-Dec-21,"If you're in NYC, you have to try Joe's Pizza. It's arguably the best pizza in NYC. When we first arrived, this was the first place we stopped at. The line was long, but it moved fast. I'd say we waited about 15 to 20 minutes. Was the wait worth it? Hell yes! We got 1 Caprese, 1 Cheese, and 1 Supreme. They were all delicious. I'm a simple guy so I enjoy a classic cheese pizza. Joe's does it right. From the flavor to the crust, it's all there. New York style at its best. One bite, everyone knows the rules rating? This would be a 9.9. Yes, I said it!"
20-Dec-21,"We're visiting from Baltimore, and if anybody knows me they know I love my pizza so of course we had to check out the Spider-Man pizzeria! Service was quick for them being so busy, and the pizza was perfection!"
20-Dec-21,Very good pizza but a very long wait into the door. The wait is totally worth it! The sicilian pizza is bomb deliviousness!!!
20-Dec-21,"Great pizza, quick service and hot pizza. Out of the pizza joints we tried in town, this was by favourite by the slice place. Busy location, good place to grab some grub."
19-Dec-21,"Is it good? YesIs it worth the wait? NoThat's just my opinion. My mozzarella slice was burnt on the bottom. I like thin slice, but when it's burnt, you don't really taste the pizza, but more of what an oven tastes like.Place is tiny and there's only a little standing room to eat."
18-Dec-21,Yum!!!!! That's all I can Say!  New York style pizza at its best!  We were tired and hungry after a long plane trip.  Line looks long but moves quickly.
18-Dec-21,"Pretty long line to wait in, but the pizza was good. Nothing special honestly, just a thin pizza. The flavor was there but I feel that there are plenty other places with no wait that you can get a comparable, if not better slice."
14-Dec-21,"It's okay pizza after a late night of seeing shows and hitting the city.  Would I run back for it?  Not necessarily.  Why?  Because it's one of many NY quick slice pizza joints that reheats slices, even when they're fresh out of the oven.  To me, it ruins the experience and often burns the heck out of my palette."
13-Dec-21,"Joe's Pizza Times Square. Line was out the door and down to the corner. Wait time was nearly an hour. Pizza was just okay, nothing special. It was a heck of a long time to wait in the cold. Many pizzas were leaving by bicycle delivery. I think they had six pizza ovens going and it still wasn't enough, but folks were willing to wait. This was my first time visiting NYC and this is my pizza story, so basically any grocery store frozen pizza is better than this place and almost any pizza in Austin, TX is better than this. Pizza Foundation in Maria, TX is 100 times better as is Comfort Pizza in Comfort, TX. Conan's Pizza in Austin is way up there too. Conan's is Chicago-style deep dish on whole wheat crust. It will blow your mind."
13-Dec-21,"Wow. Really good slices. Love the crust and the toppings were super also. Enjoyed the supreme, white pizza and fresh mozzarella. Very tasty. Line is intimidating but moves quickly, so just do it and get a slice. You will not regret it."
12-Dec-21,New York trip wouldn't be complete without Joe's Pizza. Finally got to have it on my fourth day. One slice is enough for one person with average appetites. The pizza was flavorful and the crust was crisp. Would go back again on my next New York trip
12-Dec-21,"We ordered a large pepperoni pizza for delivery. They said it would take an hour but it showed up in way less time (like 30 mins). They delivered to our hotel, and called to let us know when they arrived so we could meet them in the lobby. A little on the greasy side but otherwise good!"
12-Dec-21,"Joe's Pizza is an institution. This location, on Broadway at the southern end of Times Square, stays open late slinging slices. When the line is out the door, ordering a full pie comes with a long wait. The cheese and pepperoni slices are quality New York pizza, with thin, firm crusts and high quality toppings oven-baked to crispy perfection. The supreme slice is my favorite: I'm crazy about the red onions and I've found that this one's less likely to burn your mouth if you bite in right away. While delivery is available, my preference is to get it from the source. If you've eaten at other Joe's locations, you know what to expect."
11-Dec-21,"I really hate coming to New York for pizza.  I get depressed knowing Chicago has nothing like it and only the deep dish which makes me wanted to diet for six months straight. Lots of white flour. As usual, this place hit the spot. I had chicken BBQ which had breaded chicken with cheese and BBQ sauce. Embarassingly enough I also had one of my THREE dinners there later that day and returned for the standard cheese slice with that signature new york chew to the crust. I am sad as I type and in serious withdrawal. The guy says to me ""Have you seen us on TV?"" I say ""I'm from Chicago"" Replies ""You don't have a TV in Chicago?"" I love NY."
9-Dec-21,I can definitely see why all these well known celebrities come and enjoy this pizza! It was delicious! Our first NYC pizza was definitely one for the books! Amazing service!
7-Dec-21,12/2/21 I never liked cheese pizza. But after trying the cheese pizza here I can honestly say. I love cheese pizza now I came back twice during my visit. The only problem now  is no cheese pizza will be good enough now. I have to come back to Manhattan again. See you soon Joe' pizza
5-Dec-21,Quick service right in the heart of Times Square. The line was long however very quick! The slices are typical NY style slices meaning large so be mindful of how many you get. The flavor was good and it wasn't super greasy. Really nice and friendly guys working there. Great prices too.
4-Dec-21,"Don't be put off by the long lines, service is super fast. We split the Sicilian and the fresh mozzarella. The crust of the Sicilian was lovely and focaccia-esque but I think the fresh mozzarella slice was even better - normally not a fan of thinner crusts but this was just thin enough to highlight the toppings."
3-Dec-21,"This place never disappoints. No matter when you go or what time of day this place will hit the spot. By the slice is my favorite concept. This last time we had pepperoni, white and cheese. All good but the white is by far the best for me. Love it! The service is fast so even if there is a line so sweat it's quick and they heat the slice quickly so it's nice and hot. Tip: if you want to order a full pie, go straight to the counter or better-call it in so it's ready for pick up. Standing room only but there's plenty of space and counter room rotates quickly so you can always find a spot."
1-Dec-21,"Pizza was hella good! Thin slices with crisp bottoms! We had a bit of a wait in line outside but it went by pretty fast. Pizzas are about $4 to $5 per slice depending on which one you choose. We were thinking of buying a whole pizza, but it's quicker to just buy per slice. If y'all don't already know this pizza joint was in one of the Spider-Man movies! Pretty glad we stopped by wheee while visiting time square!"
1-Dec-21,"There was no way I was going to pass up the chance to hype this place up. A little disclaimer that I'm not a big pizza fan so when my family wanted to try this place, I didn't have high expectations. HOWEVER, this experience changed my view on pizza. I think this is the only place that has gotten me wanting another slice after eating one. I think it's how thin the pizza is, but the taste is all there too. You don't even have to go crazy with the toppings. A simple pepperoni pizza here will make you want to come back for more!"
28-Nov-21,Terrible pizza. Tough crust like rubber. Hard to chew and the cheese was hard. We kept trying to microwave the pizza but it did not work. I would not recommend their pizza.
26-Nov-21,"Loved the pizza, but huge line and ok customer service. Can be understood busy place, hard to show great customer service. But at least pizza is amazing"
26-Nov-21,"100% my favorite pizza ever. There is almost always a long line, but it goes fast. Be ready to order. Not much on the menu which is ok because you know what they do have, they make it well. Must try NYC"
21-Nov-21,"Another must go to place in NY. Pizza is always delicious. The thin crust with yummy toppings. Even the cheese pizza is good. I prefer my pizza with toppings, so any of them are delicious."
20-Nov-21,Yes! Yes! More please! Okay NY pizza this is it! Yummy yummy and more yummy! Can I take one home? I'm biased I love me a good Sicilian pizza. So this was amazing for me to find and devour! Definitely come try them!
19-Nov-21,"Wanted to grab a late night bite and of course had to come to Joe's. This was my first time (visiting from out of state) along with my friend (also her first time but she's lived in NYC for 3 years!). Definitely high anticipation! There was a long line but went by super quick! This place doesn't have any sit down seating, just grab and go kind of thing. We each got two slices. I got the cheese and caprese(?). Was not a huge fan of the caprese, but the cheese is always a good classic that doesn't disappoint. Surprisingly, two slices were super super filling. Even though we were super hungry, one slice could've been enough! In all, yes it's a touristy spot, but definitely worth visiting!"
19-Nov-21,"We went here on a Saturday night to get a couple slices of pizza and there was quite a long line, perhaps 30 people long. Although, it did move fairly quickly and we got to order our pizza within 30 minutes. Boy is the staff here busy, they are all running around making pizzas and throwing them in and out of ovens it's quite the sight to see. We ordered two slices and some drinks and ate the slices inside the restaurant, which is a bit of chaos at how busy it is. I wasn't impressed with the taste of the pizza, the bottom of it was black and very crunchy, and the top of the pizza didn't have much taste lacking sauce and had plain tasting cheese. I don't get why this is so popular for such mediocre pizza!"
18-Nov-21,"Quick, flavorful, clean, satisfying. Good cheese, the taste of the crust is good. They have pellegrinos to drink, not just your standard pops/sodas. If you are in a hurry, and don't know what to get, it would be difficult to go wrong with this option. Make sure you fold the slice before you eat it, it DOES taste better."
17-Nov-21,Great New York pizza just try to go on no busy time or you will wait a lottttt Thanks
16-Nov-21,"Great pizza with amazing crust and toppings, quick staff, crowded with lots of people (always a good sign) and fun overall!"
16-Nov-21,"This pizza was so dang good that we had it 2 nights in a row! The first night in the city, we walked to Times square and got a slice there. It was packed and it was 11pm, but so worth the wait! The next night we had it delivered to our hotel and ate it in bed and again for breakfast the next 2 days!!!!!!!! It was perfectly cooked and baked!! If you are in NYC, definitely go to Joes Pizza! You will not be disappointed!"
14-Nov-21,"Heard a lot of good things about this place. However, my Girlfriend and I both were sick the next day. Should have gone to Juliana's."
14-Nov-21,"Very satisfying and tasty pizza. But tbh, for the most part I've really only known NY pizza, so I can't say the pizza I had was anything that blew me away. I would've given Joe's 4 stars. It was comparable to Gino's, a chain out on LI where I grew up. After realizing I gave Gino's FIVE stars, I decided Joe's deserves no less than 5 stars.For a packed restaurant, speed of service was not bad. I am sure this restaurant, especially with all the celebrities you see on the wall that have visited, is used to being busy. I give the employees a lot of credit for serving great food without making customers wait. The cashier was also super nice. When we asked for extra plates, he said, ""Why not?"" and gave us several extra with a smile.People of Joe's, you're very appreciated, and you've made a few more customers happy. :)"
13-Nov-21,"When in New York, you must try the pizza. I found that it was a blessing that we lived in the Time Square since this place (and many others) were nearby. I'm going to be honest - I wasn't exactly blown away by the pizza. It was delicious but it had its minor flaws (burnt crust etc etc). Regardless, it was good + cheap enough that we came back multiple times during our stay since it was so convenient. We had the supreme pizza, cheese pizza, and margerita pizza (not pictured). I'd stick with the cheese - it's a classic!"
13-Nov-21,Love the pizza from Joe's!  Traditional NY style pizza.  Happy they sell slices instead of whole pies.  Lines were long but it moved fast.  Located off 40th and Broadway.  My daughter devoured her cheese slice and I chowed down on the pepperoni slice.
13-Nov-21,"Not a long wait, surprisingly, maybe 3-5 mins. This is delicious and filling New York style pizza. The interior doesn't have seated tables, this is a quick grab-n-go style pizza place. Cheap, delicious, and filling. One slice would have filled me up but I got two because I was visiting NYC and wanted to try the white pie. Many celebrities (Drew Barrymore, Bill Murray, Selena Gomez, Steven Tyler, J. Cole, Anne Hathaway, John Stamos and more) have come here, but that's just a perk. They have framed pictures of all the celebrities who have come through Would have been delicious either way. Don't come here if you want a seated dining experience. Just off Times Square for a quick snack or dinner before catching a train or flight is ideal for this place."
12-Nov-21,"Quick and dirty, just like New York City. Whenever I visit a Joe's pizza, there's always a line. By the time I reach the front, the pizza that I pointed at moments ago is already heated up and waiting for me. Self explanatory ordering and payment process. Still a pretty expensive pizza but deservedly so for all the popularity and celebrity traffic that it receives. The quality of the pizza is not the best. But apparently, it's a must go for every first timer in New York."
12-Nov-21,"If you're looking for a classic basic pizza, this is your place. Stopped by while walk around. The line gets pretty long, but service is fast. We ordered the supreme, pepperoni and cheese. All were great. Would come back again."
11-Nov-21,"Wanted New York pizza while we were staying in midtown and of course, saw all the good reviews and decided to try it out.We first went on a weekday evening around 6 and the line went outside. We decided to come back the next day in the afternoon and there was no wait. The pizza is classic New York pizza. Big slices with thin crust and crunch. When eaten fresh, it's delicious so we ate it right outside in their seating area! It was enjoyable but I wouldn't say it's all that different from other New York pizza places. We tried another on a whim and it was just as good! I'd come back here for a quick slice as long as there wasn't a wait! Expect waits in the evening due to tourists!"
11-Nov-21,First place I ate in NYC was Joe's pizza and it did not disappoint.  I had the caprese pizza and loved it. The crust was sos crispy and thin. Definitely will try the other pizzas
10-Nov-21,"Best pizza I've ever had!! Not too oily, and perfectly crispy! I just love how quick they work. In and out! And they heat up the pizza for you on the spot as well!My interest in pizza had been on a downhill trend until I had my first bite at Joe's!  Can't wait to finish every item on the menu!"
10-Nov-21,"The location in the village. No other Joe's or Joe's imitator puts the sort of love into it as this one. Fast service, very fair price. My boyfriend likes the classic cheese, I like the fresh mozzarella. Brought my 70-year-old mother here at 2 am and now she won't stop talking about how good the crust was."
10-Nov-21,"If you need a quick slice, this is the right place.  The pizza is delicious and the service is fast too.  There is no place to sit but they have counters space around for the customers to eat while standing."
7-Nov-21,"Pretty cool place, fast service, hot pizza. What else do you need?The slices are nice and big, I got the pepperoni and my fianc√© got the cheese which I had a bite of and really enjoyed."
7-Nov-21,Pizza is delicious! Crisp and flavorful. Definitely a must stop if in Manhattan. Expect a line though. Worth the wait.
6-Nov-21,Took Edward Scissors hands out for some pizza this Halloween 2021 and he and I both loved it!!! BOMB ASSSS PIZZZZZAAAAAA!!! Don't miss out. If the lines long suck it up and wait. It's so worth it
6-Nov-21,I can say this is the best tourist trap pizza I ever had. I enjoy a good tourist trap and this one I enjoyed the most with a slice of Joe's pizza. Among one of the best pizza slices I ever had. The inside has pictures of celebrities who dropped by to have a slice. Unfortunately none stopped by this time but the real celebrity was the slice of Joe's pizza. Kevin Bacon approved.
6-Nov-21,"I'm so glad I got to experience a REAL pizza in all of my 62 years of existence! And after trying it two other places, I'd thought for sure it would be the same!! Nope! Hands down, it's her"
4-Nov-21,"Good, not as good as the 14th street location which is Real Good. I like Spiderman!"
4-Nov-21,"If you want to play tourist while in NYC, you HAVE to stop by Joe's. We were craving pizza as I was in town for a work trip back in September 2021, and we started asking locals and police officers around Times Square where to get the best pizza--THEY ALL RECOMMENDED JOES!Hands down the BEST decision of this trip. We were NOT disappointed. I'll admit, they're very busy but the staff is very fast and efficient and you'll get your pizza within 10 mins of waiting even if the line feels really long at first. The cool thing about Joe's is it's somewhat of a landmark as well as many celebrities have passed through to grab a slice throughout the years. It was very cool to see photos of Leonardo DiCaprio and Lenny Kravitz on the walls. Joe's was even featured in the Spider-Man film. All that to sauce, we were NOT disappointed. In fact, we ended up eating at Joe's twice while staying in NYC as they're open late night. I tried the pepperoni, cheese and caprese pizza. 10/10 recommend! Tastebud overload. If you're visiting NYC, make sure you grab a slice for yourself and take a bite. (reviewing this makes me wish there was a Joe's near me--I'm in California, lol)"
4-Nov-21,"Joes is a classic NYC staple and I like the fact that Joes is super speedy. Their pizza is mediocre, it's good but it's not great! I did enjoy the price - we paid $18.50 total for 2 drinks and 4 slices. It gets insanely crowded but I think that's to be expected. Probably wouldn't go again."
1-Nov-21,"Small little shop, Sicilian pizza was amazing a cheesy. The thin slice was also delicious however the bottom was a bit to burnt for my liking. Very little floppiness in the slice though which is always a plus. Not a pro or con but they only accept cash so keep that in mind! Something very old school about that, you can't hate on it."
30-Oct-21,"The first thing I had to do once we got to NYC is get a slice of NY pizza. I heard Joe's was amazing and I had to make that my first stop. It was nothing short of perfect. I had to try the original pepperoni but also saw pictures of the caprese slice on Yelp and had to get that too. The caprese was my favorite. Fresh ingredients with delicious melty cheese. If I could have eaten more then 2 slices, I would. It was so good. The best start to our NY trip."
30-Oct-21,"ICONIC EXPERIENCE ! It was the next to last day of our recent exciting 8 day vacation in Manhattan, New York. My wife and I had ticked off some really cool stuff on our bucket list and wanted to finish with a big bang. We wanted to walk across the Brooklyn Bridge and we also wanted to go to the very top of the Empire State Building...it had to be one or the other. A few Lyft drivers plus our Hotel Beacon doorman had said to us....if you walk across the Brooklyn Bridge you gotta get pizza at Grimaldi's. And when we had a lovely breakfast at Bluestone Lane on Amsterdam Ave early on Friday morning a fellow diner told us that Joe's Pizza was better than Grimaldi's. DECISIONS DECISIONS ! In the end we decided we didn't want to beat ourselves up too much on the next to last day of our fun vacation....Empire State Building it was gonna be. Around midday on Friday, Oct 1st we took the subway to Times Square, bought some some children's clothing at Macy's and then headed to Joe's Pizza on Broadway. We rocked up around 1pm and the joint was really busy with a line out to the sidewalk...but it looked a TON OF FUN too ! Standing in line watching the routine we pointed out to a worker behind the counter the 2 varieties of slices we wanted...THEY ALL LOOKED GOOD ! My wife wanted Pepperoni and I chose the Sicilian. This place is like a well oiled machine....we paid ( under $10 all up ) the cashier and he said they would heat up our pizza slices. In a minute or so we had our hot pizza slices and walked outside to the small sidewalk patio. We sat on a bench and enjoyed our New York Style Pizza Slices....thin firm crust and lots of flavor ! It was all was needed before heading off for our 2pm date with the Empire State Building !"
28-Oct-21,"Classic NY pizza. Good service and good people. I would recommend the Supreme, though the others are just as good. Love this place"
26-Oct-21,Okay so not only is this place awesome because it was in Spider-Man this place has AMAZING pizza for a reasonable price! My husband and I have been talking about how we need to go back.. looks like we'll be taking the train in again sooner than we thought! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
25-Oct-21,Get it at the store fresh because it is sooo yummy! We really enjoyed it. Even though they had a huge line out the door they were very quick. We got this pizza through Uber eats too but it wasn't the same.
24-Oct-21,"Amazing pizza. Crust is thin, nice and chewy, and flavorful. Topping frankly a bit sparse though, and they actually forgot one. Doordash gave a nice partial refund though, after I complained to them. Pickup a bit chaotic and you have to be assertive to get to the front of the line and get the guy's attention. Got an 18"" pie which lasted for days, with decent taste and crust texture even on microwave reheats days later."
23-Oct-21,Perfect spot for a quintessential New York slice. It's ideal to grab the slice to go and munch while seeing the sites. The classic cheese pizza was amazingggg.
23-Oct-21,"Great food, well worth the line.  I had to give it a shot after hearing the hype and definitely lived up to expectations! It's great that you can order custom pizzas and/or purchase pizzas by the slice.  I went with the order by the slice method and can honestly say that you can't go wrong by any of them!"
22-Oct-21,"Pizza.mmmmmmmmmm,I LOVE pizza.This place was fantastic when I first ate there.After you eat at it about 17 times you might want to stop eating it since it has the original pizza stuff but I don't want to stop eating it because it's pizza!"
19-Oct-21,"Just OK. I thought the crust was too thick for a thin pizza and the sauces were not flavorful enough. Toppings were fresh. Slice options were pretty limited. Lines were long but moved quickly. After Rubirosa, it ruined most pizza places for me. Now that place was stinking delicious."
19-Oct-21,Holy moly! I can see why this is the best pizza in town! You have to eat their pizza. My husband and I had their cheese and caprese and their both so good! Highly recommend! I need to get a pie next time I'm in the city it's that good!
16-Oct-21,"We have three species of pizza here. The top two pieces are plain cheese, then there is the obvious pepperoni and the third piece is Joe's fresh mozzarella. Nothing went to waste. As a traveling foodie; I wanted to scout out a great pizza. I believe our BarStool pizza friend gave this an 8.5 - Rookie Score. This is by far an 8.7!You can order by the slice OR you can order a pie. The crust is everything I always wanted; the perfect Italian crust. It's the crust your looking for when you trying to find good pizza. The sauce is very good and the cheese has the right tang to compliment it all. The fresh mozzarella slice was slightly different but highly recommend you try for yourself. Always nice to wash it down with real cane sugar coke - I went a little overboard but it was fun!"
16-Oct-21,"So many pizza places in the city, I had forgotten Joes and how good it is. Recently popped in here for a quick bite prior to a show and the pizza hit the spot. My favorite is the white slice! I need to come here more often!"
14-Oct-21,"My favorite  pizza slice place in New York. A legendary Greenwich Village taste cheap eat. It is actually perfect in its simplicity. No fancy, standing pepperoni pizza here can make your day."
14-Oct-21,"I wanted to try some authentic New York pizza while I was visiting, so my friend recommended Joe's since we were near Times Square.Service was super quick; we were in and out of there within 5 minutes on a Tuesday evening around 7 pm. I forgot exactly how much I paid, but it was around 5 bucks for a slice of the Caprese.There's some limited seating there, but we decided to eat outside at one of the tables in Times Square. It was a short walk of 1-2 blocks.I prefer my pizza with thick crust (deep dish is my favorite), so I've always been skeptical of New York pizza, but I surprisingly enjoyed my Joe's slice. The crust was thin yes, but it was also extremely crunchy, very possibly the crunchiest pizza crust I've ever had. There could've been a little bit more sauce on the slice, but I thought it was already pretty good.Next time I'm back in New York, I'd love to try one of the dollar slice spots and compare it to Joe's!"
14-Oct-21,"Decided to come here right after checking in the hotel. I wanted some New York Pizza! I ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of cheese pizza. It was very good! thin and alot of cheese! I loved everything about it.Some things I didn't like about the place was it was VERY crowded. It was very small inside. There was not alot of places to sit. we ended up eating outside on the counter.  It was dirty there too. They need to have someone wipe down their countertops. Would I come back? Probably not. The pizza was good, but the place itself was not. I would rather go to another pizza place where I have a place to sit and it is clean."
11-Oct-21,"I'm not surprised that this place came so highly recommended to me. I was extremely pleased with the pizza we got delivered. It was perfect to share (or not share, do you), and hit the spot over and over again with every bite! Worth the carbs"
10-Oct-21,5 star late night pizza. Crispy on the bottom with a thin crust. Toppings were fresh and flavorful. Tasty sauce and good sauce/bread/cheese ratio. The line moves relatively quickly and there's some stand and eat space. Perfect for the post drink bite late at night.
8-Oct-21,"Crispy bottom. So good! Long line, but it moved fast. Lots of counter space for standing and eating."
8-Oct-21,"Easily the best pizza in NYC. The line will be long but totally worth it. They also have the bottled cokes, which are superior to non-bottle sodas."
5-Oct-21,"It's THE BEST! Tell me why all the celebrities eat here then? Go here, you won't be disappointed."
5-Oct-21,"I had two slices of Supreme for a light dinner. They were superb. The MOPS combo of mushroom, onion, pepperoni and sausage wipes the floor with most of the competition in the five boroughs and can hold its own with the elite institutions. I had another four Supreme slices the next day for lunch at room temperature. Leaving it out overnight had very little effect on quality. It's just that good. The onion is neither raw nor cooked through, but just perfect and quite welcome to help digest the copious meat spread. I am a big mushroom fan. These are not from a can. They are the tall, thin variety and very fresh. I could eat any of their pizzas daily if my weight stayed fixed. But Joe's definitely makes a weekly visit a great choice in a city full of excellent pizza. The four burnt circles in each quadrant form their own balanced symmetry."
4-Oct-21,Ordered them through door dash and was disappointed. They got our order wrong. They gave us green peppers instead of pepperoni. Worst was the pizza was burnt. Did not seam freshly made. More like a reheated from the night before.
4-Oct-21,"Came in on a rainy Sunday afternoon to grab a couple slices. One pepperoni,  Sicilian and one supreme. The pepperoni was great came out really tasty. Sicilian was tasty too. The supreme may need to be rotated in the over or the patch it was on was very hot. The tip up u til about 1/2 way was cooked great, then the crust started to have burnt parts which wasn't very tasty. I'll have to go again to give them another try."
4-Oct-21,"Great authentic NY Pizza! A must go if you're in NYC. Piping hot, cheeeeesy and pure deliciousness! We had it for breakfast! You order in line and can stand and eat in there by a counter at the window or in a covered area seated outside. Don't miss out!"
2-Oct-21,"When you're thinking of authentic New York style pizza, then you'll feel right to try Joe's Pizza near Times Square. The sauce is saucy and delicious, the cheese is cheesy goodness, and the service was NYC fast fast fast. Pair your pizza up with a coke and you're good to go. Can't wait to have it again next time I'm in NYC!"
30-Sep-21,"Definitely a place to go for a taste of NY. Whenever we are in town, we make it a point to stop in and grab a slice or two! Definitely a must try if you have never experienced Joe's !!"
30-Sep-21,"This was a must on our list. we were there at 2am and the line was out the door. there was a wall full of celebrities that came to Joe's Pizza. Unlike others, this pizza wasn't that great.  even though there were some sauce, it tasted dry. I mean it's cheap but I think I needed to be more drunk to give this pizza 5 stars."
29-Sep-21,AMAZING PIZZAProbably one of the best spots in town. If you order in advance you don't have to wait in line
29-Sep-21,Nightclub-like line on the weekends but the staff keep the line moving at an impressive pace. Definitely worth the wait.
21-Sep-21,"Good, straight-to-the-point New York pizza!We had one slice of Supreme and one slice of their Sicilian pizza, and both were tasty. The Supreme had more meat and flavor on it, compared to the Sicilian, which was just cheese and sauce on a thicker crust, so I preferred the Supreme more.We went during the lunch rush, and they give you your pizza immediately upon checkout at the cash register. Would recommend!"
19-Sep-21,Im a native NewYorker who now resides in TX. Oh how I enjoy coming back to enjoy a real Slice of pizza !
18-Sep-21,A really great slice of cheese pizza! I don't think it's anything mind blowing but you won't be disappointed with it. Its very thin and crispy which I love. I would go back!
16-Sep-21,"You're in New York and inevitably you hear about this place. Whether you've seen it in the Spider-Man movies or just a simple google search and this will pop up. While it's no dollar for the slice , the pizza is excellent. Can't go wrong grabbing a slice of that perfectly mastered New York City pizza out at Joes"
14-Sep-21,"Honestly the pizza probably isn't anything special. Hell, they heat it in the oven right in front of you. But if you don't go to NYC and have a NY pizza slice, are you even being a tourist? We were looking for a quick, cheap bite to eat. Asked a NYPD cop around Times Square. He pointed this place out. It hit the spot, not necessarily because it was anything spectacular but you know your trip to NYC is complete with a NY pizza."
12-Sep-21,Best pizza I've ever had. 1 slice is not enough. I regret not getting another one. There was a long line but it moved quickly. Would definitely be back.
12-Sep-21,"Delicious! Great, thin, chewy crust with just the right amount of cheese. They have a variety of slices, but pepperoni is my favorite."
9-Sep-21,"Customer service really sucks! Extremely rude peeps, don't even answer properly when asked a question. Quality of pizza is below average at best."
8-Sep-21,"We wanted some good NYC pizza and we were able to get some at Joe's. Next time in NYC, definitely ordering from here"
8-Sep-21,It probably wasn't the wisest choice to pick 9pm on a Saturday night of a holiday weekend to try Joe's for the first time.But this was absolutely worth the wait. This is what every other NY style pizza is trying to taste like.
8-Sep-21,Love Joe's thin crust pizza - one of my favorites and New Yorkers' go to. $4 for a slice of pepperoni.
5-Sep-21,"There was a long line and the pizza was mediocre.  We should have known, it was to close to Times Square to truly be good food.  It served it's purpose, but we will not be going back."
3-Sep-21,"I heard a lot about this place and was pretty excited to try it. My pizza arrived ice cold, when I called they said they would make a new pie and send over, which they did--however when the delivery dude arrived, he asked for the old pie back, which my kids had eaten since they were hungry (kids will eat anything--also, why did they want the old/cold pizza back? Perhaps to reheat and resell--gross). The delivery driver was rude and refused to give me my new hot pizza (or just my money back) and the store manager wouldn't listen either. Pretty terrible experience overall. I would avoid this spot. Anyone else get a cold pizza?"
3-Sep-21,I was visiting NY and looking for good pizza by the slice. This was perfect. Loved the crust. House special was yummy!
2-Sep-21,"The best pizza we had in New York city, although it was big queue to order but worth the wait."
23-Aug-21,"Mama Mia!!! Holy crap Joe's Pizza is sooooo goood. My mouth is watering as I think about the thin, crispy slice of Pizza I had here. We came here after a long day and we sure did get lucky because not even 2 minutes after we walked in the line was out the door.  Their line moved fairly quick,  service was decent,  there is indoor and some outdoor seating.The Pizza was freaking so good. I loved it so much I ended up coming back the next day and having some more slices myself.  I didn't like the pepperoni by far the cheese was the winner for me. The sauce and crust mmm so good I would come back again and highly recommend!!"
21-Aug-21,"New York's best pizza ? Joe's Pizza is consistently on the top of the list of best pizza places in town. A celebrity favorite & known for long lines, it's considered the gold standard for classic NY pizza. It is the-real-deal. Why? On the surface, all thin crust pizzas kinda look the same. But for me, it comes down to that first bite. The crunch. The crispy hot crust juxtaposed against dripping soft delicious cheese & ""just"" mildly sweet sauce that offsets & balances the salt as it makes the journey across my tongue. Ah.... So good.  Is this hyperbole? Perhaps. But great pizza can be an almost religious experience, under the right circumstances (feel free to use your imagination). The one thing you won't have to imagine is how good Joe's pizza is. If you've lived for pizza, been to pizza festivals, carried that large box home in the pouring rain, you know what I mean.... Great pizza is one of life's great (accessible & affordable) true pleasures.Barely charred crust, not burned, but that subtle hint of charcoal. The slightly salty cheese & ripe tomatoes shining through the sauce. Delicious anytime, anyplace, anywhere."
21-Aug-21,Grabbed a slice of white and a slice of cheese for a grand total of $7.25.  Definitely the cheapest meal I had while in NYC.  Delicious crust and flavor but the cheese was definitely my favorite out of the two.  Would totally stop in again if I happen to be in the area.
20-Aug-21,"My first New York pizza and I was not disappointed! I got a slice of basic pepperoni and a white slice; recommended by my cousin who has been living in New York for a couple of years now. I loved both and would definitely return to Joe's Pizza! The employees were extremely friendly and welcoming. They joked when my friend and I asked for ranch and let us know ranch is not very common in New York, very much needed advice so we know not to ask and face disappointment in the future (sad). There wasn't a ton of indoor seating, but there was an outdoor area with fans where you could stand and eat. They also had a a celebrity wall; so cool to see all the ones that have stopped by and had a slice, or two, of Joe's Pizza!"
19-Aug-21,"Came here for a quick bite after drinks. Although there was a line out the door, the wait was only 5 to 7 minutes to get to the front. We tried the caprese and the supreme pizza. They warm up your slices before they serve it to you on a plate or in a to-go box. The caprese had fresh tomatoes which was a nice veggie choice to all heavier options. While the supreme was a solid choice.The pizza crust was thin and crispy and delivered on the iconic nyc thin pizza label."
18-Aug-21,"Oh, boy. I heard so many good things about Joe's but my experience was anything but good. At first I thought the delivery driver was responsible for the toppings being unevenly placed (sliding everywhere), but I don't think it was. Pricey, overcooked and sloppy. Down to give it another shot in person, but really disappointed with this particular experience."
16-Aug-21,"This was my first food stop in New York. To be honest I did not even asked what was all the hype about. I just wanted something to eat after the long flight and airport ride to the city.The line was pretty long when we got there but the wait was under 30mins. It is a really small place and it was very hot in NY at the time. Once you make it to the counter, you make your pizza selection (either from the glass or order a whole one), then you wait for them to warm it up (or cook it) in the oven. I waited no more than 5mins I believe. Once your pizza is ready, they call you up at the register and you pay.Again, small place. You can take your pizza home (hotel) or you can eat there and admire all the pictures on the wall. These are pictures of famous people. It was entertaining just to try to figure out who was who on the pictures. The sitting is along the wall and they have maybe 2 tables in the center. There is also sitting outside but its a little dirty and its along the wall. It is not ideal to go on a date, to go eat and chat with friends etc. this place is ideal to go eat delicious pizza, enjoy the wall and whatever, Yelp review and then get out so other people can eat :p Also, apparently this pizza was featured on the Spider-Man movie so there is that too."
16-Aug-21,"Good not great, over cooked burnt and tough crust, 2 slices pepperoni and 2 slices cheese and a soda for $17. Line moves quick. First stop of the trip, hopefully we'll find better."
16-Aug-21,"Pretty good New York style pizza! It's crispy and thin but also flavorful. At $3.50-$4 a slice, it's the cheapest lunch I've had in New York lol"
15-Aug-21,"Best slice of New York style pizza. Thin light crust with a hint of char, lightly sweet tomato sauce and cheese that doesn't glob together when you take a bite. Highly recommend even as a snack (it's not gonna fill you up it's a slice of pizza)."
14-Aug-21,"It lives up to the hype. Claims to be the best (or one one of the beat) and it definitely was a good slice at the end of a night. The vibe is a long line and pictures of famed celebrities visiting Joe's - from the Kardashins to DiCaprio and whoever else. The lines move fast and they had plenty of options at the counter. Decent amount of seating room as well.Food: everything was being freshly made and tossed onto the counter as you wait and decide on your pizza. The crust was phenomenal, perfectly crispy without being overdone. Sauce was on point, flavorful, fresh and not too much to make the pie heavy.Personally had:-Mushroom and pepperoni - 5/5 - would get this again. -Spinach - 4/5 - good slice but the white pizza was a bit heavier and spinach on the watery side.Excited for the trip back already"
13-Aug-21,I ordered an entire pizza and was worth every penny. This is a must stop in location for a slice of New York. It's unpretentious and just good pizza.
11-Aug-21,got the white pizza and honestly it was one of the worst pizzas i've had :( i liked the 99 cent pizza spot more
11-Aug-21,"Beat pizza ever! Huge slices, great toppings and flavor, not too much sause, and perfectly crisp crust. Everytime we visit NYC we eat here as often as possible. My favorite!!!"
11-Aug-21,"Trying to find pizza in NYC is easy and hard. Lots of choices so we decided to find someplace close to our hotel that delivered  with a decent rating. Joe's Pizza did not disappoint. It's a little pricier than the pizza at home, but my god, it was HUGE! One slice of this pie is equivalent to 2 slices in the Midwest, keep that in mind when ordering. It was delivered pretty quick (less than 30 mins) and piping hot considering our delivery driver was on a bicycle. And they were thoughtful to include a bag with paper plates, napkins, crushed red pepper, some sort of garlic type seasoning and a blend of Italian herbs. Very good pizza, we would order from here again."
6-Aug-21,"Great specialty slices! Alright plain slices, I'd stay away from their white slice as it wasn't very fresh and not really too popular. Everything else was good though."
4-Aug-21,"Such Great Pizza! Wonderful crust, great sauce and no shortage of toppings! Visiting from TX and decided to order in for the night.  So glad we did!"
31-Jul-21,"I'll start by saying I love any and all pizzas!  If I were on death row I'd choose pizza as my last meal.  Was craving a pizza yet again (I can't help myself) and Joe's Pizza came to mind.  I really had high hopes and was excited to finally try it.  I placed my order to have it delivered.  I could hardly contain myself, my hunger was anxiously anticipating a really good tasting pizza!  Finally, about 45 minutes later a knock at the door!  The wait was over, it's here!  I open the box and although hot, the presentation was just okay, the pepperoni distribution was definitely disproportionate.  Taking the first bite was the real test.  Nooooo, whyyyy?  It deeply saddens me to report that Joe's pizza was a huge disappointment.  The pizza crust could best be described as that of a thin, burnt, useless floppy beach hat.  I couldn't even take a bite out of it because it just drooped straight down.  I had to fold it in half like a taco to take a bite.  And to make matters worse, the sauce and burnt crust lacked any real flavor.  Overall a huge letdown and waste of $30.  This is NYC not Kansas!  Joe, please go back to the drawing board.  New Yorkers deserve better!"
28-Jul-21,"I don't know what the hype is about ? The pizza is not good it's plain basic pizza, nothing special the crust is super burnt  and hard . I got nothing to say about it ."
28-Jul-21,new york style pizza really good and it was thin and crunchy not soft on the bottom
27-Jul-21,"It's a cool pizza place. It was recommended by another tourist couple we meet. There's a very small dinning inside (counter only/ standing). There's also dinning outside but again it's very small. There's a line out the door, seems like it's busy all the time. Location is by time square.  I thought it was average pizza, but that's because I'm surrounded by a ton of mom and pop pizza place where I live. Enjoy"
27-Jul-21,"Quick late night bite in the middle of Time Square! The staff is so friendly and efficient. I got a cheese slice and a coke (must!!!) and he got a margarita slice and a veggie slide. All toasted. They were perfect - crunchy to the bite yet solf enough for a fold. There are several locations, and we tempted to try another location, but ran out of time..."
24-Jul-21,"Ok this is good but not the rave that all the YouTube New Yorkers that we watched said it was. Honestly, Los Angeles pizza is better and we aren't known for that. It's not that cheap either (avg $4 a slice depending). I could have definitely gone without it. We will see what other New York pizza is like. Looking forward to those reviews!"
19-Jul-21,"Really solid pizza spot! Thin thin crusts with great flavors, slices were giant, and quick service."
18-Jul-21,"Loved the heck out of my 3 am pepperoni pizza. Everything I wanted it to be; hot, round, cheesy and covered with pepperoni. Delivery was quick and I passed out happy."
16-Jul-21,"Slice of pepperoni. Not just a tourist stop near Times Square, legitimate great pizza. Fast, friendly and great food."
16-Jul-21,"When visiting New York I knew I wanted to try authentic New York pizza. I decided to go to this place and it did not disappoint! When we walked in, they quickly got our order, heated it up in the oven, and gave it to us in less than five minutes. It was so delicious that we came here a couple days later for dinner. Definitely the best pizza I have ever had and I'm just drooling thinking about it now!Margarita Pizza - With walking a mile in the heat, this pizza was super refreshing and got me in a better mood. The tomatoes were sweet and the basil made it ten times better! The cheese was nice and stretchy and with the crispy, crunchy crust and bottom, it was a 5/5!Sicilian Pizza - I forgot to take a picture of this one since it just looked so good. Everything on the pizza tasted amazing they just complimented one another. Again with the crunchy, crispy crust, just absolutely amazing. 5/5"
14-Jul-21,"First vacation away since COVID and we went to NYC - of course the very first thing we did after checking in was to go get a slice.  It was hot and humid - a line of people waiting and a packed eating area.  The line moved quickly and the heat was forgotten with that first slice of pepperoni.  It was even better than I remembered ... thin crust pizza with the grease just dripping off, it was like heaven!  They say some things never change ... thank goodness this is one of them!  The slice was awesome and will be back later in the night to fix those after entertainment munchies..."
11-Jul-21,"Heard so much about this place we had to stop and get a slice as we were walking by, even though we just ate lunch.We just got a slice of the cheese pizza to share outside and we devoured it in seconds. The slice was huge, pizza was light, the crust was thin and the bottom was slightly crispy - all for under $4.Note, if you're looking for a sit down dinner, this is not the place. There are only 2 tables inside and then some bar seats."
9-Jul-21,"To be honest, I was disappointed. The pizza place was buzzing with people and the line was 20"" out the door.  When we got our pizza, it was hard and chewy. The 2 stars is only for the taste.  Not coming back to this place however, people locally love this place.  Not sure why!"
8-Jul-21,"Alright so Joe's is famous and I think people should try it once, but not twice! There's so much better pizza nearby honestly - I think the 99c pizza on certain corners are often better and Patzeria Perfect Pizza has literally 10/10 margherita slices (it's just a couple streets up). Okay but back to Joe's - I got a spinach slice and a Supreme Slice. I regret the spinach (1.5/5) but the supreme had a ton of meat and was pretty good (4/5) I didn't eat the crust on either though, because it was too tough, burnt, and didn't taste good either."
8-Jul-21,"Very tasty and affordable Italian pizza  , loved it! Definitely our best pizza spot in Manhattan."
8-Jul-21,"WOW so good! The line went by so fast and even though it's a little on the ""pricy"" side for slices it's 100% worth it!!"
4-Jul-21,Very rude..  States that they open at 10:00 so my husband and I from out of town came here for a slice.. the cashier rudely just said we're not open..we ended up leaving.
4-Jul-21,Pretty good large slice of pizza. I got the sausage one. I wish the crust was more crunchy.
2-Jul-21,Decent pizza. I really liked the white with spinach. Love ricotta on a pizza. Super busy. Standing or sitting options. You can buy by the slice or a whole pie.
2-Jul-21,"Best pizza I've ever had. Hands down. . I love pizza, like a toddler it's my favorite food... visiting NY, I wanted to try the best rated... I ordered online at 1030pm my husband ran down the st to grab it. We went with our go-to pepperoni mushroom. It was absolutely perfect.  Every bite had the perfect amount of meat, veggies and cheese. The crust was thin enough to fold but not too thin where we were worried it would rip. The sauce was a flavorful marinara that covered the pie. Honestly I'd drive back 3 hours just to have more."
1-Jul-21,"First trip to NYC in my life and was fortunate enough to spend a wonderful day with my family. I read about Joe's prior to leaving and the reviews just had me itching to try some pizza. Now, some may think it's super cliche to order pizza in New York City, but honestly, my mindset was that if I'm going to NYC, I'd have to eat like people who live in NYC. That being said, I had never had authentic New York style thin crust. After getting off the Red Line 1 near Time's Square, we made our way east to Joe's. It's what would be expected of a NYC style pizza shop; small and crowded. There's also a little wooden addition out the front with a bar for standing room so guests can eat and go.Everything looked and smelled amazing. Although there was a line around 6 deep ordering, the associates moved quickly and everyone was at checkout before they knew it. We arrived around 1:30-2:00pm on a Sunday and the line never really got smaller; they just turned orders that quickly. Quite remarkable if you ask me. Between my family and I, we consumed Pepperoni Pizza, Plain Slice, & Caprese Pizza. It was amazing. The only recommendation I give is make sure to eat it NY style...fold the slice length wise and eat like a sandwich...it makes it less likely to lose any of those delicious toppings.Bottom line: Great experience and great food. Can't wait to visit again when we come back to the big city."
1-Jul-21,"BEST slice, literally EVER. Coming from a non pizza lover, I would fly back to NYC just for this. We had Joe's Pizza probably 4 times in a weekend. It's the best ""NY slice"" we've tried, the first bite is literally a dream. Paired with some red pepper flakes and an ice cold root beer, HEAVEN."
1-Jul-21,Mistake ! This made me very disappointed. My whole vacation is ruin. I'm now afraid of place with the name joe in it. I feel bad for giving the leftover to a homeless person because they don't deserve it. I'll probably not eat pizza for a year after eat this atrocity. This pizza will live on as a meme in my family for generations. I can't wait to get back home to and talk to my therapist. I should of gotten gas station pizza. Topping weren't put on properly and pizza just taste terrible. I wouldn't be surprised if this was all a cruel joke done by the meddling of a lesser god.
30-Jun-21,"After our Circle Line evening cruise, we thought we'd go to an Italian restaurant close to our hotel, but they were closed, so we thought we'd just order pizza delivery.  Easy Peasy.  No.  Due to limited hours for Covid, the first two places I called - this is 10 pm on a Friday, mind you - were closed and done for the night.  They both answered and those were their responses. Great.  We were hungry.  I kept looking on Yelp for close pizza places that were still open.  I found Joe's and was able to order & pay right on Yelp.Within a very reasonable amount of time, we had a large cheese pizza and it was fantastic.  We devoured it except for 2 slices, and put them in our mini-fridge.  We ate them cold the next morning.Thank you Joe's!"
30-Jun-21,Ordered with DoorDash and wasn't sure what to expect from this place. Reviews seemed decent.Wood fire crust and was quite delicious. Food came decently warm and dug right in.Can't seem to find where my photo went so unable to share. Would definitely return and try the food inside next time.
29-Jun-21,"Joe's Pizza was so good! The staff was friendly, it was kept clean, and the restaurant, although small, was organized and neat. Food was excellent."
29-Jun-21,"Overall: 9/10Visited New York with my family and had to try a classic NY style pizza. I discovered Joe's Pizza on yelp and saw the amazing reviews so, I had to stop by. I couldn't tell if I was just extremely hungry after traveling all day or if was really that good. Either way, the pizza was incredible. Who knew pizza could be so good?The thin, crispy crust was the best! The ratio of sauce to cheese to toppings to crust was PERFECTION. Everything just melted in my mouth. If I had to pick one, I would choose the white pizza. It's unique, it's delicate, it's mouthwatering. The extra cheese adds so much flavor and goodness."
27-Jun-21,"When you tell somebody about trying ""New York Pizza"", then ya gotta bring them to Joe's. It's an iconic staple in Manhattan with multiple locations scattered around. The line is usually fairly long at rush hour but they are pretty fast! (Can easily get a slice in under 10 mins). Staff is very friendly and polite and Joe's has such a nice vibe to it as well. The pizza itself is filled with so much flavor. I think the secret to success in a good pizza is the sauce. The pizza was evenly baked (with some burnt spots through the pie, but I think that a necessary for a good pie).The pizza was so good I carried a pie 8 blocks up (to 49th street) where I parked my car. If I ever come back to Manhattan you KNOW I'm stopping here"
26-Jun-21,Long line but it moves quickly & it's worth the wait. Perfect place for anyone who's trying New York pizza for the first time & anyone who's a veteran pizza eater.
26-Jun-21,"Great prices, great staff, great location and extremely easy on the budget. Get a slice but skip the busy Friday and Saturday nights! You'll be spending over 20 minutes in line."
24-Jun-21,"Excellent place to get no-bs, NY-style pizza. Joe's is extremely popular and possibly a bit over-hyped but nonetheless consistently delivers good NY pizza. The caprese is probably one of their best slices. In my experience, the quality of the pizza has also been better after midnight around 2am when the place is packed and busy. This however is purely anecdotal, and I would say this spot is still worth visiting at any time."
23-Jun-21,This was my favorite pizza on my trip to NY! Good service and excellent pizza! Will definitely return
23-Jun-21,"When I was planning the places I wanted to eat in Manhattan, I knew pizza was going to be a hard one since there are so many great pizza places. I chose to go to Joe's because of the history and great reviews I've seen.Luckily, the line was only a 10 minute wait when I went and once I walked into Joe's, your attention immediately goes to all the awesome memorabilia and photos of celebrities on the wall. It's also awesome to be able to see all the staff make the pizza in the background. They only have 5 different pizzas but this allows them to fulfill orders fast. I got a slice of the spinach, pepperoni, and white cheese. The pizza was great. Thin crust, nice and crispy and sauce was very tasty. I wouldn't say it's one of the best pizza's I've ever had but Joe's is a must visit when in Manhattan for a great experience and a great slice of pizza."
23-Jun-21,"Our first stop for NY Style Pizza - excellent! Had a Pepperoni Slice and a Cheese Slice. Sooooo friggan' good! Gotta be that NY ""Wuttah"" that makes the crust so perfect...."
22-Jun-21,"There's a huge reason why Joe's always has long lines. And that answer you is very obvious. Their pizza is damn delicious. Is it better than Chicago's Deep Dish? ...Hell no. But it's still very tasty. Despite all mixed reviews, you shouldn't leave New York without trying Joe's. I went a little to crazy but we finished it all. They all looked so good so I almost tried one of each haha. I had a to get a plain cheese, a Sicilian square, pepperoni, Fresh mozz and a Caprese. They were all phenomenal. Couldn't really pick one favorite over the other, and when I go back, I'd probably order the same ones all over again. The pies had plenty of cheese with the perfect amount of sauce. The crust was baked and burnt to perfection. It gave it a nice doughy bite with some crispiness. If I really had to eliminate one it would be the Sicilian square. I've had better but this one was still pretty good. The line wasn't really too bad. It's long, but it moves fast. The staff here was also great. They'll make sure they get you in and out with some great tasting pizza."
15-Jun-21,"ah yes gotta get pizza when you go to new york, and you should give joe's a try!! there's an appropriate amount of hype for this place. but don't go in with too much expectationthe magarita tasted really healthy, with little seasoning and just mozzarella and tomato. therefore, if u wanted pure junk food straight up greasy pizza (like me), do a slice of cheese or pepporoni. they tasted more like an american pizza"
14-Jun-21,"Honestly, the best tasting pizza I've had in my life. I got a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni, and the pizza (that came out immediately) exploded with flavor in my mouth from the first bite. In addition, I paid $7.25 for the two slices (together), which I feel was a bargain.I recommend folding the slice when you eat it, because the slices are thin and can be messy."
13-Jun-21,"Wow. People should boycott all public venues that don't have public restrooms. The pizza was good, but before you eat sometimes you have to use the facilities. You spend all day walking around and you can't drink anything because finding a bathroom is like searching for a pot off gold. Then there is a homeless man outside who probably urinated right where I had to eat my pizza because he couldn't use the bathroom. New Yorkers should be outraged at the people they literally support  denying them basic human rights. I can't imagine people coming to Las Vegas and not being able to use the casinos restrooms. Charge people to use them if being decent without pay is too hard, but not having a bathroom in a place of business should be illegal. No wonder New Yorkers got so sick. I'm sure they are dehydrated and irritated. The Pizza was good enough though."
12-Jun-21,"How is this place so hyped?I'd rather go somewhere else for New York style pizza, this place disappointed"
12-Jun-21,My favorite New York pizza place Perfect place for a quick bite. Highly recommend the White pizza.
10-Jun-21,"Quick service for huge and thin slices at low low prices; what's not to like?I haven't had all lot of pizza in NYC yet, but I can see why Joe's is considered one of (if not the) best pizza places in NYC for authentic New York style pizza!10/10 will be coming back for more delicious goodness!!"
8-Jun-21,"Stumbled upon this gem while visiting New York. This is a must try for authentic New Yorker pizza. The best pizza I had while on my visit. There was a line out the door but it moved quickly. The staff is hustling to get everyone in and out. Good selection of pizzas. I tried the cheese, pepperoni, and margherita pizza. All were 5 stars!"
7-Jun-21,This is a great place to come in for a quick slice and go about your way. We were in between checking out some museums and wanted to get a quick bite. The pizza's were fresh and tasty. I ordered a fresh mozzarella and my fianc√© ordered a slice of pepperoni and margherita. The crust was thin and crunchy which I appreciated The pizza's were not greasy and didn't give heartburn.
7-Jun-21,Fast and great. Thin crust pizza so you can taste all the toppings. Many celebrities come here and now I know why. Very popular. There was a line however it went fast.
7-Jun-21,"Great pizza all around! My favorite is the Caprese with fresh tomato, mozzarella and basil. My husband loves the regular cheese pizza and white pizza too. I love the thin crispy crust, and they have great tomato sauce"
6-Jun-21,Such a great New York experience. We loved it!  Went back for seconds. I highly recommend the caprese. But we tried pepperoni and all three cheese varieties. They were all delicious!!
5-Jun-21,"OMG, Joe's Pizza was actually great. Reasonably priced and quality. Every thing we bought was awesome and the menu itself was to die for. The crew was extremely welcoming and service is terrific. Overall, I love this place. Highly recommend Joe's Pizza."
2-Jun-21,"Great late night cheese pizza!  Price is right too.  It arrived fresh, hot, and on time."
29-May-21,There are all the .99 cent places in Manhattan. Some are good but most are like Ray's. If you want authentic and amazing NY pizza go to Joe's locations. You will be very happy to pay more for a slice. The difference is the crust.
28-May-21,"Not a big fan of the pizza hype here in NY. Honestly, it's kind've overrated and a pie from dominos or Pizza Hut is just as good for like half the price. If you're looking for some unique flavors or tastes I'd opt in to a NY specific chain but otherwise would just avoid these tourist trap like places. That being said compared to other chains in this area this did stand out for its quick and attentive service and the pie was quite tasty for an okay pizza. I do think it's super overpriced though. Give me a $1 slice anyday."
27-May-21,"OMG, Joe's Pizza is really rather darn cool. It was very reasonably priced. Every single thing that we have chosen had a lot of flavor, especially Pepperoni Slice. All of the staff are incredibly welcoming - you truly feel welcome and taken care of. If it's good enough for me, it's good enough for me."
26-May-21,"Didn't expect it but, Joe's Pizza was really fabulous. Excellent place and the rates are reasonable. Such an awesome menu, it was extremely hard to choose, but I am really happy that I had Mozzarella Slice. The team was extremely helpful and service is fabulous. Joe's Pizza...What a fantastic find."
26-May-21,"Excelent Pizza and Delivery Service, Best Pizza in NY it's Joes Pizza at Broadway. I Came to New York very often this is my best place to eat o order a pizza."
25-May-21,"They get the fifth star this time around. Delicious hot slices with the service of a fined tuned machine. Some tourists from L.A. asked me where to go in the area for NY Pizza, and I sent them here and told them not to worry about the line. See you guys soon!"
23-May-21,After a long trek across the country pizza was the first thing we looked for and we weren't disappointed by this DoorDash option. The crust was perfect and we ate the whole pie in one sitting because it was delicious.
20-May-21,"For someone who new nothing about NY pizza, this answered all my questions. Crisp bottom, good portion of sauce and cheese, enough for a cheese pull, and fluffy dough. Nothing fancy, but man does it hit the spot. I was also surprised by the squares with the crispy tall edges. That might have been my favorite actually"
18-May-21,"Joe's Pizza offers an amazing psychology lesson about the power of herd mentality, but the pizza isn't just underwhelming; it's downright bad. Let me guess -- you googled best pizza in NYC and every single list you saw has Joe's on it, right? This isn't even a 5/10 on a scale of ALL NYC pizza joints (including holes in the wall and dollar slices), so it's utter blasphemy to call this elite or special pizza. It tastes like a basic slice you'd have at an 11 year old's birthday party at a bowling alley. If you think this is quality pizza, you're either from Kansas and/or you have Covid and cannot taste properly. Cheese slice is beyond basic and I wouldn't eat it if you paid me to. Honestly. Fresh mozzarella slice has absolutely no flavor, so it's technically not ""bad"", just pointless calories.The white slice is the exact same as every other white slice you've ever eaten. I majored in psychology and find Joe's to be a fascinating example of review-based herd mentality. Everyone tells you how good this pizza is, but it's just not. At all. Want to try some legitimately awesome pizza? Skip the basic garbage at Joe's and check out these instead:John's of BleeckerTwo BootsSaucePatsy'sMotherdoughLucali"
16-May-21,"Didn't expect it but, Joe's Pizza was definitely astonishing. Rates are absolutely reasonable. Every single thing that I have already tried has been pretty flavorful. The workers were very great, smiled a lot, felt genuine. Found Joe's Pizza with the help of yelp and would return any time."
14-May-21,"Great place for a fast slice. Nothing fancy, absolutely perfect. Standing room only..."
12-May-21,"I came as soon as they opened up on a Saturday morning at 10 am as I was trying to get at least once slice before I had to check out of my hotel at 12. The staff were still preparing the ingredients and just starting to make the pizzas for the day. It was about 11:15 when they started serving but only had cheese and pepperoni available. I ended up ordering their plain cheese and ate it while walking towards times square. The pizza was good but I was a little disappointed as I really wanted to try their capresse slice. The sauce was decent but not anything I would rave about. Next time I'm around, I'll come back for sure later on in the day."
12-May-21,Love Joe's Pizza! I love their classic cheese pizza. I've also gotten it delivered and they always do a great job!
8-May-21,"I'm honestly not sure why this has such great reviews. I'm honestly thinking it's because it's so close to tourist hotspots and celebrities eat there, but I don't know. I definitely don't think it's the absolute BEST in the city. I'd also be prepared to have cuts all over your mouth for the next few days because of the high crisp factor in the crust/dough. I think the cuts in my mouth just wasn't worth it. It's great drunk food. I would say... the best slices I've had here are the fresh mozzarella and white pizza."
7-May-21,"So fucking rude.  They let people cut infront of our entire party, no fucks given.  The guy got my order wrong and still charged us extra Even though he miss heard us and he was so fucking rude.  Pizza was only okay for shitty service,  Worst service ever!  Just on service don't ever go.  When I asked the guys name he said Adam which was not true.  I was there on 5/6/2021 @around 1230 am.  One employee can bring a place down just on service."
7-May-21,Love how this location has a dining area (standing only) outside with a view of Times Square. Slightly burnt bottom but still good nonetheless. Will definitely come back for more pizza!
5-May-21,Definitely was a great way to start my New York trip. New York is famous for their pizzas and this spot definitely lived up to its name.
3-May-21,"I am not happy that I ordered a food in this restaurant. I needed to wait for a pizza for 2 hours, after that I spent some time talking with delivery support. As a result I have received completely cold pizza. Moreover, driver didn't call me and I needed to guess ""is it delivered or not"". So, to summarize if you have 2 hours and like completely cold pizza, it's your choice - you will be fully satisfied and happy.Attaching pizza slice photo (several slices of pizza were burnt)."
2-May-21,"Where do I begin with the legendary Joe's... popular with tourists (especially this location). The staff are friendly and they all wear masks properly. I got a whole pie but when I was waiting for it I saw that most people get slices only, which they reheat for you. I ate my piping hot pie in the car - it was really fresh of course, but sometimes I wish they would add more sauce."
30-Apr-21,"Deserves the ranking it got, its a really good slice, you are made to feel at home highly recommend"
25-Apr-21,"A New York City staple cuisine and location. As a New Yorker all my life, I had to try out what the hype was all about and it didnt disappoint. Went with my coworkers and we loved the pizza. The Sicilian was my favorite. It wasnt oily at all (as oily as most pizzas are) We tried other ones like the Caprese and pepperoni slices and all were great. There are multiple locations throughout the city. One in each area of the city so it's not hard to grab a slice. They also have a location in Williamsburg Brooklyn which my friend goes to almost every week. Overall a great pizza joint that lives up to the hype and considered one of the best of NY."
22-Apr-21,Came during Covid - they have a hand sanitizer dispenser - spaces social distances although the condiments and trash can be next to you with high traffic areas - if you feel safe enough to eat there instead of take out then you prob wouldn't mind anyway - great pizza quality per usual !
20-Apr-21,"They get 5 stars solely on their cheese slice. If someone asked me to define what a NY Slice tastes like I would point to Joe's. They perfected the recipe and is one of the very few 9.0 and above pizza places in my book. Joe's cheese slice has the perfect ratio of dough, sauce, and cheese, and when you get a fresh slice, forget about it! I wish I lived across this place on drunk nights. Must try!"
14-Apr-21,"Great stop for a fresh slice of NYC pizza! Give this place a try, don't waste your time in those .$99 pizza places."
11-Apr-21,"Joe's Pizza is iconic for offering that quintessential New York slice: a thin crust triangle the size of your head, crispy and cheesy. It's one of the most famous pizza spots in the city with many loyal customers and fans. I had high hopes going in for a late night slice and I was certainly not disappointed. The crust was properly crispy and thin, providing a satisfying crunch sound every time it's bitten into. The toppings and sauce were good as well. I can't say that it was the best slice I've ever had in my life and it didn't blow my mind, but it was good in the sense that it delivers on what it is meant to: a classic thin crust New York slice that's hearty and filling, a very solid late night treat."
31-Mar-21,Great spot if you want a quick slice or two to satisfy your cravings. The pizza taste good with fresh ingredients. The caprese and supreme are both good. The service is quick.
30-Mar-21,The best cheese slice - can't beat it. We went twice just to be sure! And the garlic salt is heaven! Can't wait to be back!
26-Mar-21,"Insanely delicious pizza. I usually go for the plane, but their mozzarella slice is pretty good as well. Typical ny slices, large, dough isn't too thick, sauce has a great flavor. Appreciated them being open during COVID. A real nyc staple!"
24-Mar-21,The pizza was so good!!! Very very reasonably priced and the people were so nice. The wall was so cool to look at and see the different famous people that have been!
21-Mar-21,"I've gone to the West Village Joe's for years. Their pizza is amazing and in my view arguably the best in the city. It's not fancy, they crank out pizzas with abandon and they take orders and ring you up fast and move on. What their pizza also offers: no nuts, no soy, no sesame and no eggs. When food allergies are a consideration as I've written before - it limits the options and/or you're typically looking for off menu - grilled chicken and mashed potatoes. We ordered a full pie and the family gobbled it up and at 20 bucks it's frankly a steal for the quality. Thank you Joe's - still one of my favorites ( RIP Franny's in Park Slope)."
18-Mar-21,"Wow, Joe's Pizza was really great. The ambience is lovely. White Pizza that I have ordered was absolutely great, it had a lot of flavor and was absolutely delightful. Bonus that their service is so really good, they are so quick and polite. Joe's Pizza - Very impressive."
18-Mar-21,"Horrible customer service, they all have attitude problems and then they have the inaudacity to serve lukewarm pizza, seems like they don't want to work here and are underpaid cause they're unhappy whenever they serve customers. They need to hire better workers here."
12-Mar-21,This was the worst pizza I've ever tasted. It might just have been last night but based on last nights pizza delivery I will never order from Joe's again. The pizza barely had a bottom to work and the Barnett ahead tasted so burnt it was ridiculous to eat to eat
8-Mar-21,"Being from California traveling to New York, of course I was going to try an iconic New York slice. I went to multiple pizza places during my trip and nothing compares to Joe's. This is the greatest pizza in the city, and possibly in the country. I don't know what makes New York pizza so great, but I was in awe from the first bite. I wish I could've packed boxes of it in my suitcase to bring back to the West Coast. I've even Googled if it was possible to somehow get Joe's shipped to my door. I haven't been able to eat pizza without comparing it since being back home. I dream of the day I can go back and eat another slice, yes it's truly that good."
5-Mar-21,My pizza was burnt and salty. Honestly I think the dollar slice pizza is way better. I was convinced by all the great reviews literally spent $30 on a plain cheese half pepperoni pizza and all I have to say is I'm highly disappointed.
4-Mar-21,"MUST TRY PIZZA IN NEW YORK!!!Traveled from CA to spend the weekend in NYC and everyone said to try Joe's. It was fantastic! 10/10 recommend. It has been spotted in tv shows, movies etc. Its literally ICONIC..."
2-Mar-21,"OMG, Joe's Pizza was definitely magnificent. Joe's Pizza is a hidden treasure. Only quality. I think their Mozzarella Slice is just delightful. All of the staff are extremely pleasant - you really feel welcome and looked after. The service was good and I would definitely go back to Joe's Pizza."
28-Feb-21,"Honestly, it's so much hype in this place. The pizza was OK to me it is not good at all really. I really think that celebrities that go there is a form of advertisement I know good pizza. Customer service rude"
27-Feb-21,"There was no wait- we walked right inside and ordered immediately. We each ate a slice and it was excellent- perfect for grabbing a slice to go. There were markings around for people to stay distanced, and they had masks. There was a small heated area in the doorway for an extra place to stand, which we did for a moment because it was raining. Fast, great slice."
25-Feb-21,"Once upon a time, when I was 23 and single and counting my calories, I went to Joe's Pizza for a work event and didn't eat any pizza. It was a terrible decision, one that I have regretted for years, especially as I never made it back. I may be mistaken, as I don't recognize the interior photos, but I think this was the location I visited. If not, oh well, as this is a COVID-era review anyway--I finally got to try the pizza, but only after it flew to meet me in Los Angeles.My friend Tom W. very generously gifted me a Goldbelly subscription, and one day, two beautiful frozen Joe's pizzas showed up on my doorstep. One was cheese and one was pepperoni, and my husband and I got to enjoy two excellent pandemic pizza dinners. Both the cheese and pepperoni were great, and I'm sure they're even better fresh out of the oven.2020 might have been my first year since college without at least one trip to New York, and I hope to go back about as soon as I get vaccinated. One day, I'll visit Joe's Pizza again in person, and I will not be an idiot and decline the delicious pizza."
24-Feb-21,I was extremely happy with how fast as well as how friendly the delivery driver was.    Five stars there.  When I got to room was amazed that even ordering later in the night how thorough they were with making sure we had all plates napkins and condiments. The one down fall which  was the pizza was cold.  That was a bummer.  The taste texture and pizza itself was good but unfortunately a cold pizza not even warm takes away from the Pizza and experience.  We had no way to heat up so ended up only eating one piece
3-Feb-21,"Ordered in two pizzas, a regular cheese pizza and a Sicilian. Arrived way faster than the ETA, and piping hot. The Sicilian was good but WOW the regular cheese pizza was delicious! It's exactly, in every single way, what I think of when I'm craving pizza. The right flavor, texture, dough-sauce-cheese ratio, just perfect."
2-Feb-21,"Pizza toppings were great, but the pizza itself was a bit thin. We are from Chicago, IL and we like our thin crust to be firm. Great service, and the only place open during a winter storm (that we called)."
29-Jan-21,Best slice in the city.  Love the one on Broadway.  Pepperoni so damn good. This is the go to pizza place when in town.
26-Jan-21,"Glad this place is still open! Got 4 slices ( spinach, supreme, caprese, white). So yummy, perfect on a snowy day. I like caprese and spinach  ricotta the best."
24-Jan-21,Joe's was my first meal in NYC and it did not disappoint ! I got a whole pie with mushrooms and sausage and devoured more slices than I care to admit in one sitting. The crust was great and toppings were v generous. Will definitely be coming back for more sometime soon ! cheesy umamiquintessential New York sliceMama I made it :')
24-Jan-21,Trash!! Uncooked!! Pizza oozing out the box!! Nasty!! Cheap ingredients!! Definitely not worth the price.
22-Jan-21,"This pizza was DELIGHTFUL. We went on a Saturday evening and even with a line of ~10 people (vast majority of them getting individual slices), we had our full pizza made-to-order for takeaway within 30 minutes of entering the door! The pizza is HUGE so keep that in mind when you're ordering. I mean, we got this for 2 people and finished it but I'm not sure if that's normal or we were super hungry  The crust was light/airy while still having a nice crunch/bite. I would TOTALLY go back for this pizza!"
19-Jan-21,"Wow, Joe's Pizza was really impressive. The ambience is lovely. Plain Slice was really excellent, I have tried few things here and Plain Slice is my favorite without a doubt. The staff was great and really accommodating. Joe's Pizza....Love it."
11-Jan-21,"Delicious. I was visiting town and wanted some authentic pizza, which lead me to order from Joe's. The pizza was absolutely delicious and the size was huge!"
11-Jan-21,The pizzas are amazing. Something about the tomato sauce felt fresh. It didn't feel to oily eating it.. The pizza had a slight crunch to it when you bit into the pizza. One of my favorite pizza places so far.
6-Jan-21,Best pizza Ever!!! NY style thin pepperoni slice... always!
5-Jan-21,Was very excited about Joe's Pizza. I heard this place is the best. It was very busy. The photos on the wall were very cool. The pizza was average at best. Half of my pizza was burnt but this was not discovered until I got to the hotel. The service is  rude and your business does not feel appreciated but that's what you grow to expect in NYC. Joe's pizza is not worth a vist.
4-Jan-21,"I'm a true fan of NY style pizza so the hand-tossed thin crust pepperoni and mozzarella pizza from Joes was right up my alley. While it's priced a little more than others in the area, it was worth every bite! They are practicing COVID guidelines with no indoor dining however outside they do have a weather protected area where you can eat.**So #WhileUAreHere, Do good. Be nice. Order pizza and Repeat."
2-Jan-21,"Washington Square on Jan 2, 2021. Although there's no inside dining we were able to enjoy out Sicilian and Caprese pizza outside at a table accross the street. The pizza was nothing spectacular but tasty nonetheless."
1-Jan-21,How does this place have so many stars? Pizza was not good at all. I'm a New Yorker and stayed at a hotel near by and no were near as good as the pizza in Brooklyn/Queens area. I guess I could see Tourists that don't any better liking it but I can't.
31-Dec-20,"A staple and must try pizza place in New York. Joe's pizza has an amazing slice of NewYork style pizza. The iconic pizza joint has appeared in many movies, games, and photos with celebrities which appear around the store insides. The pizza itself is very delicious sweet and served at a good price. I have been here many times before, but my recent visit was different due to covid. Despite this, it was actually kind of better since the line was quick, not crowded, and decent outdoor seating. I would highly recommend this to people visiting as it is a quick and tasty meal. Especially if you are walking around the city on tour."
27-Dec-20,Quick evening pick me up in the area. I really do miss late night Joe's pizza after a night out but for now this will suffice :).  My favorite is their white sauce slice!
26-Dec-20,The pizza that started it all!I wanted a slice of true NYC pizza and Joe's is definitely the pioneer of that. I ordered a whole pepperoni pizza online and my order was ready by the time I arrived (yay! So easy)The pizza: omg the tomato sauce + thin warm slice + roasted/toasty crust = AMAZING. I've never tasted anything like it in California or chicago. I stuffed myself with 3 large slices because it was THAT good.Would I come back: YES! please try Joe's if you've never had it for one of the best pizza experiences in NYC
12-Dec-20,I searched for pizza place in Times square Manhattan NY and most reviews were about Joe's Pizza. So I was a view minutes from where we were. We walked there and line was long outside of the restaurant but it was moving fast. We were in line for about 20 minutes before we could order but it's really worth the waiting. Great pizza. Highly recommended.
11-Dec-20,"I tried this pizza yesterday and they were ehhhh ok for me. Not the best not the worst, I tried once and I don't wanna try them again. Customer service is excellent. They accept cards as payment method. Their pizza are pricey and I consider that they don't worth it. I tried better ones in New York. Anyways, thank you."
9-Dec-20,"Best slice in all of NYC!That's all my review needs to say, it is the perfect slice of New York style pizza, each pizza is cooked incredibly well has a perfect crunchy crust and a oooey gooey cheesy layer... absolutely delicious! The store is clean and the ordering process is easy, you don't usually have to wait to long for your pie or slices. The store is small & can get a little crowded at times but it is well worth any hassle you have to go through.Love Joe's, my favorite pizza hands down."
7-Dec-20,When I vistded New York city/midtown and I had a taste for pizza. 1 I heard New York had the next best pizza next to Italy. Another reason it was only 5 min away from me walking distance. When I got there I know to must have been great because people were lined up to get some. When I finally got my pizza it was the bomb I could not stop eating it. If you visit New York City and have a taste for pizza definitely come here.
6-Dec-20,"Joe's Pizza is one of those long-standing NY establishments that is literally a slice of New York. Family run and operated for at least a few generations, they've been featured on multiple food shows. I believe I saw them on Tasty 101's Worth It series, as well as a couple other Food Network shows. Being close to Times Square there was usually a line out the door pre-covid, but that's greatly thinned out the past several months and usually pretty quick (a few minutes or maybe 7-8 minutes tops if you get your pizza heated up) to pick up a slice to-go now. Personally I've had pizza here a few times, last being two weeks ago during covid times, and though I'm no picky pizza fan, I can attest that the quality of the pizza dough and toppings are better than the $1 dollar slice pizza around the corner. The extra bit of chewiness and crispness adds to the texture of the crust, and the toppings are plentiful and fresh. The flavors have a slight more nuance and smokiness from the oven. Overall a solid choice if you're looking for good quality pizza in the neighborhood."
5-Dec-20,"I had the spinach pizza...the crust was good, nice and crispy. I am more of a sauce guy and had high expectations for a slice. I would come here again and try something else. Definitely a New York City staple."
1-Dec-20,I didn't really expect a place like this to climb to the top of my pizza list but it has. I don't know if its #1 just quite yet but its definitely top 3 and it's definitely some reliable pizza for a solid price; especially considering its midtown. I typically get the fresh mozzarella and sausage for 27 dollars. I really wish the 20 dollar grimaldi's pie was around but no longer... Grimaldis is basically just as expensive. This place doesn't feel like an authentic italian pie as much as grimaldi's did but it certainly tastes good! Generally service has been solid and they oblige my requests for plates and/or bags. I'll be a customer here unless someone has a better suggestion!
29-Nov-20,They don't do social distancing. Covid -19 hot spot. They're many great New York style pizzerias In this area though! This is not one of them.
28-Nov-20,I've been here the last two times I was in the city. This place is tasty! The pizza is thin with a bit of a crunch with yummy light sauce. I had the mozzarella and ricotta slice which was good. The pepperoni slice was my boyfriends favorite. He said the pepperoni was on point and in every bite. I personally enjoyed the Sicilian slice which was super crunchy! I wish it had some toppings. I don't know whether you can add any... mine just had cheese. Everything appeared clean. Everyone wore a mask and there was hand sanitizer by the door. The only concerning part was some people would start eating inside while perusing the photos with celebrities on that decorate their walls. There is a bench outside people sat at but there was a steady flow of people so it wasn't always available. Napkin dispensers were full! They sell a variety of non-alcoholic beverages. No bathrooms.
27-Nov-20,"The staff here are spot on: friendly, efficient and fast. Pizza was good and affordable. Would return for a quick bite if I'm in the area again."
24-Nov-20,Great slice of pizza. It's thin and so crispy. A perfect snack sober or drunk ;)
23-Nov-20,Definitely one of my favorites to stop by when I'm in Midtown. Can't go wrong with a slice of Joe's pizza. Always a good environment.
20-Nov-20,"The city never sleeps - shortly after landing at LaGuardia and quickly checking into our hotel, we walked straight to Joe's Pizza. Casual and understated, we didn't feel out of place in our airport clothes. We ordered a slice of Caprese and a slice of what I believe was the Supreme, which had mushroom onion and pepperoni. Crust was crispy perfection, not soggy on the bottom. Definitely a must eat when in the area and looking for a casual bite to eat late at night."
12-Nov-20,"I don't get why this spot is ranked so highly. It's pretty good, but absolutely nothing special. Pizza generally has too much flop, at least when ordered via delivery. Don't want to hate too much tho- pretty good"
12-Nov-20,Definitely I have to put a review because I come to eat this pizza in my first time here in Newyork and the crew are so hottest thanks you guys to make my pizza hot
12-Nov-20,"I pass Joe's dozens of times and never went in because there was always a tourist line outside.  But changing times means changing oppotunities, and I finally got myself inside and the walls are covered with famous people past and present.I  ordered two slices, I got sausage and a sausage pepperoni combo because meat on top is a must for me. The pizza dough was cooked perfect and it was not too crunchy and not too soft. There was an amazing amount of cheese on it with the tomato sauce was a blend of sweet and regular.Hopefully, the tourist will be back lining up like old times and I probably be making my excuses again, but who knows since now I will have flashbacks and I just may line up too."
9-Nov-20,"Joe's has a good NY slice, but it is definitely not the best in the city. It's everything you want in a basic reliable slice."
1-Nov-20,Ordered delivery from here at my hotel and pizza was cold and disgusting. Family was so disappointed. I eat here all the time and was just angry on the service and attitude of the person on the phone. Very poor customer service
30-Oct-20,"I had a delivery order during the pandemic and everything went as well as ever. The delivery was on time, quick and efficient. The margarita pizza was as good as any. I also ordered a salad and it was fresh and tasty, with dressing on the side.  They always include oregano and hot pepper flakes, as well as, plates and utensils. I still find Joe's to be a top notch pizza delivery even during Covid-19."
25-Oct-20,We were very disappointed with our Sicilian pizza from Joe's.  There was hardly any sauce resulting in a dry and tasteless pizza.  We couldn't finish it.  On the bright side the order came really fast!
25-Oct-20,Real good pizza! I'm picky about crust and this one was nice and crunchy and toasted. Good ratio on cheese (I hate when it's gross too cheesy) and yummy sauce.
23-Oct-20,"UTILITY PIZZA AT IT'S FINEST. Exactly what we were hoping for. No nonsense. Big slice, tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni all spot on. Stewart's cream soda -- per Anthony Bourdain - a must have with your pizza."
18-Oct-20,Excellent pizza and excellent customer service! Recommend to anyone who enjoys authentic New York pizza.
18-Oct-20,When we asked someone where to get the best pizza Joe's is where we were directed. It was just as restaurants were allowed to seat at 25% so some tables were out on the sidewalk and a few indoors. Pizza was amazing and slices were cut larger and just perfect for a quick lunch while shopping. Next time we are in NY we will be stopping by.
17-Oct-20,"Took a quick trip to NYC for a wedding and our first stop was here. This was my boyfriend's first trip to NYC so We had to get some food classics. First one on the list was a good slice of cheese pizza (we've been on a classic cheese kick lately). Now...we're from Chicago and while everyone thinks we eat deep dish everyday, we have some greattttt pizza choices in our city! Thin crust is my favorite and New York style is one of my favs too. This slice hit the spot. The sauce had a nice flavor, a little sweet. The crust was nice and crispy but still had a little flop/chew to it. They also had this garlic powder that I sprinkled on my slice. Yummmmm. This slice was exactly what I was craving!"
11-Oct-20,"Came here during Covid- ordered online for pickup. This was the only place in the city that made thin crust pizza with artichoke and meatballs as toppings combinations (I checked like 10 different pizza joints). Placed an order online for a fresh mozzarella pizza with 2 toppings. Pick up was really easy and the box was huge. Took 20 minutes to be ready, very quick. The pizza (8/10): it was high quality pizza, the crust was crispy and the sauce had good flavors. The pizza was a little softer so we had to reheat it for it to be really crispy. The toppings tasted good but was a little bit sparse. I think it would've been even better if there were more mozzarella to make it really cheesy. The pie was $29 so it was a good price for such a large amount of food while still maintaining quality.This is a good pizza joint, check it out if you haven't or order a whole pie (it is thin crust though so I think if you're really hungry 2 people can split a whole pizza)."
5-Oct-20,"Great service, but pizza is over hypedCustomer service is spot on! My server was super friendly. The pizza is pretty good, but the crust at the end is so hard i couldnt eat it. Even though the crust is my favorite part. Tomato sauce flavor is good, tastes homemade. The supreme pizza didnt come with black olives or red peppers so I was a little surprised. I prefer the cheese pizza to the supreme, it had a nice ratio of cheese to sauce."
4-Oct-20,"Classic New York style pizza! Simple place, quick and delicious. Easy walk from Times Square, it's a grab and go kinda place as there's not too much space for dining."
25-Sep-20,"Cheap, yummy, and hit the spot. Not the best pizza I had in the world, but it's a great cheap bite. It wasn't overly greasy which I liked. I got three slices, the Margarita pizza, all white pizza, and a veggie pizza. I enjoyed all three!"
24-Sep-20,"Great pizza that is thin, soft, juicy, flavorful! Very pricey but the taste is worth it unlike some places. They will replace the pizza for you if you are unsatisfied so just let them know. Workers there are accommodating and nice. Lots of ingredients but check with them to be sure they have it. Great cute small place. Will be back."
20-Sep-20,"Really good regular slice, not the best in the city but it's a big City. Definitely my go to in the area"
12-Sep-20,"I enjoyed your tasty pizza. Served up promptly by friendly, accommodating staff who all donned face masks. Pizza was a bit pricey, but then again it was in Times Square. I recommend cheese slices or pepperoni if fresh out of the over."
10-Sep-20,"The cheese slice was really good! The crust was thin and crispy, and the sauce was tangy with a touch of sweet. The caprese slice was good as well! It could have used a bit of saltiness or more cheese, but otherwise it was very yummy!You can walk in with a mask and order, or use grubhub to pick up, but you have to order a whole pie with grubhub.It was $8 for 2 slices. You can use credit card with a $5 minimum purchase."
8-Sep-20,This place fooled me so bad. I ordered pizza it was canceled and I never got a refund.
7-Sep-20,"This place is good but a little overrated and pricey. I ordered a meat lovers pie and they gave me just sausage and pepperoni and charged me an arm and a leg.Again, good pizza but be warned: overhyped and pricey"
4-Sep-20,"I've been ordering from here and every order is a mixed review,  but today was really bad with 2 out of 3 pies having really burned crust to the point that they were black.. on the few times that I went in person to pick up a slice or two they are always perfect,  this needs to be addressed because the quality of the product will always speak for the company."
3-Sep-20,Tried some renowned NYC pizzeria and it was good... Had Joes pizza and it tasted just as good but for less than half the price.
30-Aug-20,"The razor thin crust of goodness was amazing. I gave half to a homeless guy outside, then found out too late that it was this good. After my first  bite, I wondered if it would be rude to take the pizza back!"
29-Aug-20,"My favorite NYC slice joint! I truly don't understand anyone who doesn't rate Joe's highly. Excellent recipe. The sauce is sweet, tangy, and complex. The crust is perfectly thin, crunchy, and chewy. The cheese is high quality and not rubbery. Try their Sicilian as well. Try not to blame them if your crust is soggy due to toppings or delivery."
26-Aug-20,I remember the first time I tried Joe's pizza when I was at an event but not really want to eat much. Then I tried Joes and I still remember how delicious it was. Today Joes really make me disappointed by giving me burned pizza. I came all the way to buy them but all of those are burned
24-Aug-20,"Not an expert on New York pizza, but definitely expected a lot more from the famous Joe's Pizza.  We ordered the Mozarella pie via ubereats.  The delivery and presentation was perfect, but I was disappointed at the pizza itself. The tomato sauce and toppings easily slid off the pizza and the tip was very flimsy and a bit soggy.  The rest of the pizza was really tough to take a clean bite off of.  I usually don't mind the crust, however this crust was too hard to eat.  The tomato sauce was also a bit too sweet for my liking, and I wasn't a fan of the mozzarella cheese.  Maybe I'll give this place another shot and try their regular cheese pie.  With delivery fee, taxes, and tips, we payed about $40 for this pie and it totally wasn't worth it.  Dare I say, I'd prefer Dominos at a fraction of the price.  Well, I'll be searching for my perfect New York slice because, sadly, this wasn't it."
3-Aug-20,Came to this location and saw so many celebrities pictures on the wall that dined here before. Ordered a slice of the supreme and the staff with reheat it in the oven for you but that makes the pizza very crunchy. It's a must try if you're in the area. Only outdoor standing at the moment or to go.
20-Jul-20,Love this place. I normally stay in a fancy hotel between Broadway shows and Bryant park and the joy in life is walking down broadway after seeing a show and stopping into Joe's for a slice. Standing or sitting outside late at night in midtown devouring a huge slice makes me feel like I'm livin' the dream.
5-Jul-20,"I was meeting my friends for a movie and popcorn was not going to cut it - luckily for my tummy, I'm in NYC.  I looked up on yelp a pizza place nearby, and came here.  The service was quick, the pizza was good, my stomach was happy, and I was able to enjoy the movie without pangs of hunger distracting me."
28-Jun-20,So yummy ! Love this place for a quick bite every timeA must go to pizza place in New York City! Love this place so much
27-Jun-20,Quintessential New York Pizza.  Which is actually a Brooklyn style pizza.  May not be a DiFara but very good none the less.   My go to slice when in midtown. Open late to do any late night craving.
22-Jun-20,Really great pizza but sloppy delivery and there was even a service fee and tip.  I'd eat there next time.
15-Jun-20,"This is probably my favorite slice spot in NYC so far. I don't mind paying a little bit more than 99c for the quality and consistency I usually get at Joe's. Everything from the cleanliness of the store, to the efficiency of the ordering process, is great! I mostly stick with classic cheese which is comforting and familiar during quarantine."
13-Jun-20,"That good ol' NY thin slice! Whenever I visit New York now, I'm always on the hunt for the best NY pizza. And while Joe's may not be the best I've ever had, they still know how to make a damn good pie.  I stopped here for some late night grub while visiting NY a few months back, and the slices def satisfied my pizza craving. This particular location is close to Times Square, so I expected it to be busy upon arrival. Luckily for me, I missed the bulk of the line just by a mere few seconds. If you've been to a busy pizza shack in NY, you pretty much know what to expect. The only real space inside is basically reserved for the people waiting line. If you can snag one of the few seats at the counter, consider yourself lucky! (although things are probably different now during the current pandemic). The lines can be long but they move fairly quickly. Along with the classic thin sliced pies, Joe's also has Sicilian pizza. I'm actually a big fan of Sicilian, but I was craving for some thin sliced heaven. And that is just what I got! Opted to go meatless and doubled down on the cheese with a slice of fresh mozzarella and plain cheese. Joe's knows what fresh mozz is. Not that shredded cheese that you find in the plastic bags at the grocery store. I mean... there's nothing wrong with shredded mozzarella. But once you've had fresh mozzarella, it will be a game changer.Loved both the fresh mozzarella and the plain cheese, but something about that plain cheese just won my little heart over. Maybe it was the cheesy, greasy goodness. Maybe it was the crispy dough or the light tomatoey sauce. Whatever it was; it was love. I truly adored it. I feel like when I have thin slices in Cali, it's either burnt or the cheese is not melted enough. More often than not, I'm peeling off off parts of the overlooked crust from the bottom of my sliced. But not here. Because it's NY. They know how to perfect that thin crust because they ARE the thin crust. That's just how they be. The original. The creators. The fresh mozzarella was definitely fresh, but the cheese was actually drier than what I'm used to (womp womp). Still tasty, but I'd stick to the plain cheese any day. These slices are the perfect size! I loved folding it in my mouth. I kind of felt like a New Yorker while I was eating it even though I ain't. Their pizza is a tad bit cheaper when compared to Prince's and Artichoke Basille's, but the quality is better in my opinion. Plus, the dudes whipping up them pies and slices go HARD in the paint. They're the real MVP's. Working their asses off all damn day and still working with a passion. I respect it. I'm happy to report that Joe's accepts debit and credit cards, but it's SOOO much easier to just bring cash. Do it. It'll save you the hassle and the time of using your card. This is an NY pizza establishment that I'd happily visit again during a future getaway to NY."
9-Jun-20,"This is our go-to for pizza delivery. Quick, tasty and always reliable! The delivery menu is limited but when you are looking for a good pie, this is the spot."
31-May-20,I ordered a pie that was half plain and half pepperoni. The pie was okay. The problem I had was that Joe's Pizza sent this Latino delivery guy with no mask and no gloves. I said to the guy where was his mask and gloves? There is a pandemic going on! He says with a smirk in his face that he forgot it at the restaurant. After that I called the restaurant and I made a complaint and it was another Latino guy that answered and he said okay buddy like it was nothing. Nothing against Latinos because my people's are Latino. I just wanted to point out who they are. I will never order from here again. Not now during this pandemic and after. Also Grubhub who sometimes picks up the deliveries for these restaurants send deliverers who pick up deliveries with no mask and gloves on. This has been happening constantly. I will not support a restaurant that does not care about there workers or clients. Good luck Joe's!
23-May-20,Very high quality pizza!  I can tell if a pizza will taste good just by looking at it.  And I drool when I see the pizza at this place.
22-May-20,As I continue to order pizza from everywhere during this covid period. I noticed Joe's pizza is the best in midtown! The crust is Smokey and the dough is fresh and crispy unlike other cheaper places that are so spongy.I would highly recommend Joes whenever you need a high quality RELIABLE good tasting pizza!
29-Apr-20,"One of the better Pizza spots in this neighborhood, exactly what you'd expect for New York Pizza. When I'm in town, I like to come by Joe's (usually after midnight) for a filling piece of pizza (or two)."
28-Apr-20,"ordered a pepperoni pizza for delivery, and the crust was extremely burnt. some slices were okay (except the crust), but many slices had a burnt taste when i but into them. for the bites i did get to eat- it was pretty yummy! however, i was looking forward to the crust i had seen in their other photos/reviews. would not order again."
26-Apr-20,"Update:After my original review and 1 star the owner Joe reached out to me personally and apologized for his staff's behavior he also provided us with a free large pie. We are thankful for this. I appreciate how he took the time out to address the issue and make up for it. This is how a business keeps customers. Mr. Joe we will remain loyal customers. Thank you much. Pics of new pie included Original:I don't even want to give a star to this place. Their customer service really sucks!!!!!!!! My coworkers order a pie which cost $30 mind you, now the company I work for orders from here all the time and although the pies are good the customer service is horrible. Well during this quarantine the guys ordered a pie and it was a horrible mess when the box was opened, they asked the delivery guy to return the pie for a new one he refused and stated call store manager which they did they spoke with a the manager who refused to refund or replace the pizza and was extremely rude about it. They have definitely lost customers in this building. I mean $30 wasted, during these times who can afford to waste money. At least give them a new pie like come on!!!!!!!"
22-Apr-20,"I ordered pizza and salad. They delivered pizza but no salad. When I called for a refund for the salad they told me it wasn't their problem and hung up in my face. Frankie Boys pizza down the street is way better (sauce isn't as sugary) and the people that work there are super nice. I can't give my money to people who are this rude. I did not receive what I PAID FOR AND WAS HUNG UP ON. When I finished telling the manager what happened with my order he said ""ARE YOU DONE NOW?"" and hung the phone up. DONT SPEND MONEY HERE!!!"
18-Apr-20,"Love Joe's.  Huge pizzas, great value, always amazing food.  'Go to' delivery choice for the office on a Friday - we always buy too much, but somehow it still all gets devoured...I am from England so no expert on great NYC pizza, but I have a feeling this might be the best..."
16-Apr-20,"Our favorite pizza slice we had in NYC! Walk in here and you'll see the walls covered in celebrities who are fans of Joe's. If Leonardo DiCaprio likes Joe's Pizza, I like it too. It was about 10pm and the place was packed. Located only a few blocks from Times Square, I can only assume that it was mostly full of tourists trying this famous pizza. There are several different types of pizzas on display, and you have to be ready to choose quickly when it's your turn, as there's a long line and the staff move fast. We got two slices of cheese pizza and a margherita slice to-go and ate them in our hotel. The slices were super thin, as big as my head, and perfectly crispy on the bottom, with deliciously melted cheese. I miss it already."
27-Mar-20,"The best pizza I had!We waited in the line because we saw a crowd and decided to give it a try. The slices are huge and the prices are decent. People were all crowded inside and there were no open high tables and also there was a line forming to the outside. It went by smoothly and we ordered our pizza.Each slice was on a thin crust and was so flavorful. It really packed a punch. It didn't taste overly greasy or heavy, but just downright tasty. I will be back again to get more pizza and possibly bring it home to houston."
15-Mar-20,Pretty good! Got another pizza after my first one! I recommend The cheese pizza. It was a cute set up and love seeing all the pics of the celebrities that have came by.
14-Mar-20,"The pizza tasted ok, however I am now stuck in the bathroom with explosive diarrhea only hours after eating this pizza.   My stomach will not stop gurgling, I cannot make it away from the crapper and I feel like I have extreme FOOD POISONING!   Thanks Joes!  (5:30PM)-----UPDATE-----Hours later still cannot make it away from the bathroom.   Running out of toilet paper.   FOOD POISONING DO NOT EAT HERE!!!9:45pm------UPDATE-------I have since puked up everything I ate from Joe's disgusting pizza, and felt better immediately.   I am wondering what was on this pizza?   It was just a plain pie.    It smelled extremely bad, not sure what they are doing/serving over there but I will never eat from there again.    Board of health should check into this place3/20/2020----UPDATE-----Still sick with food poisoning from this place, still unable to be away from a bathroom.    The owner contacted me and basically said 'this is an isolated case and we will refund your payment.'  Never refunded my money, basically said this 'was an isolated case.'  Was pretty much told too bad.   If it's an isolated case isn't that even worse, like perhaps you should look into it more?"
13-Mar-20,My friend and I tried 4 different slices and it did NOT disappoint. Some say it's a tourist trap but the price is just like anywhere else and delicious. Celebrity photos all over the walls for a reason! We plan to go back before our trip ends! The line might look long but it goes pretty fast.
12-Mar-20,"Can't go wrong with Joe's Pizza, one of the staples of NY. This location usually gets super crowded due to it's proximity to Times Square. The line isn't bad these days due to the ongoing pandemic, but there's still a decent line out the store.I got the Supreme slice on my way out of work. Same signature crust with extra toppings rather than just cheese or pepperoni. It does cost $4.75 if you're willing to spend that much on a slice.It's a $5 minimum to use credit card."
12-Mar-20,"Just a perfect classic slice of pizza! I always go for the pepperoni and it tastes amazing! The crust is great, not too thick or thin. The line can get long at times but it moves quickly. Heads up at some of their locations they only take cash (not this one so you're good). Sometimes when you just need a pizza snack- a slice of Joe's does the trick for $5."
10-Mar-20,Fast service small place but you have to try it one of the best in NYC I tried cheese and it tased delicious I've been there 6 time or more
10-Mar-20,"Finding good pizza in New York is like finding fish in the ocean. There's a couple places that set themselves apart from others, the eternal search for a great pie. I wasn't impressed with the Sicilian but I was definitely impressed with the normal. Consistent, quick and good service. Definitely a great place to drop in for a slice or 3 or 4 or 5..."
9-Mar-20,"Joe's pizza is a pretty solid place to get your typical ""new york slice""! It was my first visit, but the wait wasn't too bad- the line goes by quickly! The plain cheese slice was my favorite, but they have a lot of different varieties!"
8-Mar-20,I was exhausted from a long day of touring around NYC(first time visiting). it was about 11pm and I was hungry. I got off the 42nd street shuttle and walked upstairs and ate one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had. Definitely coming back next time I'm in NYC
7-Mar-20,"One thing I can say without question, is that NY pizza is the absolute best anywhere, and Joe's tops the list. Born and raised in NY, and living in Florida for most of my life, no one comes close, and only people from NY know this is true.  It's the whole combination that makes it, the thin really chewy doughy crust, with just enough sauce so the cheesy cheese doesn't slide off when you take a bite, that orange color, and crusty enough so you can pick up a slice, folded over, without it drooping.  I ate here twice on a 4 day visit.  First I had to have the classic cheese.  The second visit, I made sure I was hungry, a cheese and also a caprese, which had fresh ripe tomatoes, blobs of fresh mozzarella, and fresh whole basil leaves in addition to their marvelous pizza sauce. That slice, I have to say, was an OMG experience. Each bite was pizza euphoria.  There was a line out the door both visits, but the line moved fast, and got to the front in 5 minutes.  Five guys behind the counter, all working fast and efficiently, making pizza, serving pizza, and cashing you out.  We even got seats in the small and crowded restaurant, because everyone just eats and goes.  So now I am already planning my next trip to NY, because it's all about food in NY!"
6-Mar-20,"It was just after midnight when we checked into our hotel and we were looking for a quick snack. I'd passed Joe's many times but never stopped in so since it was close to the hotel, we decided to give it a try.Joe's is a small spot but I was impressed to see that there were a few seats in there. They had the usual variety of NY pies at the counter and we went with very simple options - a slice of the pepperoni and a slice of the white pies. They popped them in the oven for an obligatory warming and then we walked back to our hotel to eat. It was good quality NY-style pizza and they were really good slices at that hour. We were satisfied."
5-Mar-20,"Good but not impressive and I wasn't into the hype. I know NY is known for thin crust but Joe's was a little too thin for me. Slices are a good size though and I did like their pepperoni. Just the right amount of cheese as well.Line was out the door but it went quick! Space is very limited so be ready to eat standing up. Our group of five got lucky with a couple stools. SO many famous people on their walls which was pretty cool to see. If it's your first time in NY, then I do recommend checking them out because from what I've heard, it is a NY staple."
3-Mar-20,"Why give this place less than 5 stars? If you like thin crust pizza, which we do. Eat here. There's a line but goes quick. Don't sit under the ceiling fan it will make your pizza go cold right away.  try the condiments like garlic salt. Total $16.75 with soda or pop."
1-Mar-20,Easy to find in Times Square this pizza place is by far one of the best ones that I have been to when I am in New York! Family-owned for years and years and what is very cool is that Joe's Pizza was a location filmed during the Spider-Man movies with Toby Maguire years ago!It's a very little hole in the wall with about 3 high tops and a couple bars against the walls and I wish I could jokingly say that when I tell you there was a line out the door I was not kidding! This place was hopping! While the line Looks insanely long the wait flew by and I was quickly placing my order.I opted for a slice of cheese pizza because I wanted something original and I mean being a New York obviously you need to get a slice of pizza at least once. The pizza dough was cooked incredibly perfect and it was not too crunchy and not too soft. There was an amazing and perfect amount of cheese on it and the tomato sauce was the Perfect Blend of sweet and regular. I don't like sweet tomato sauce but this place was just the right hint of it.Hot and fresh and cooked upon order this pizza is some of the best that I have had while I have been to New York the last couple of times. Many famous people also stop here as they have framed photos on the wall so be on the lookout! Reasonable prices and great food don't leave much to be desired!
29-Feb-20,"Always on point,  my only complaint is the small place has no seating ,  lots of loud and obnoxious people inside most of the time,  not sure if people go there drunk or what.  Great quality pizza though"
28-Feb-20,This is the place for pizza In New York City. Original not only on the style but also the incredible taste.
28-Feb-20,"I ordered two slices and they gave them to cold so I asked if they could warm them up a bit more. Then they forgot about them, which resulted in them being burnt. I asked if I could have two new slices given they have given me black cardboard and then they proceeded to give me two cold slices. I don't think it's a lot to ask for two warm pizza slices but they can't even deliver that. Better places in NY to get a hot slice without attitude"
26-Feb-20,Good pizza as long as there is no huge line outside.  Close but still not the best pizza in nyc
26-Feb-20,"Pizza isn't great, but what's worse is the service. I asked for a Margarita Slice and the guy who takes the order says ""where do you see a margarita slice?"" in a very condescending way. That just left a bad taste in my mouth, and I won't be coming back. If you're going to be rude to your customers, you belong in the back washing dishes."
24-Feb-20,"FIRE. Absolute fire pizza.Better than Prince Street...don't @ me.There's always a line but the line goes real quick, so it ain't no thang.You just tell the guy what you want and they heat it up and serve on paper plates. I always get a slice of the supreme and a slice of the cheese. I love how thin it is and the slightly burned crust just completes the slice.¬†Just writing about it now makes me crave it.¬†There's limited seating, so I usually just take it outside and enjoy it while walking the streets.¬†Those 2 slices comes out to $7 something and well worth it. Next time I think I'm going to just get a whole pie of the supreme...and I'm not sharing.There's just something¬†about NYC water that makes the dough phenomenal.¬†Definitely coming back for multiple trips the next time I'm there for work."
24-Feb-20,So nice we went here twice during our week long visit to NYC. Ordered:-cheese pizza-pepperoni pizza-supreme pizza-white pizzaPros:-cheap food! good food! -I like the classic cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza the best-I like how thinly made the pizza is made and the slices are hugeCons:-not a good idea to eat the next day if you have left overs. It's best freshly ordered.-there's always a line but what do you expect when it's located at Times Square and the price is cheap.Tip:-figure out what you want before it's your turn to order. the line will go much faster.
24-Feb-20,"Honestly, this is the best slice of NY style pizza I have ever eaten. The pepperoni has a strong savory flavor and the cheese was so fresh tasting. The tomato sauce was FIRE and the crust was great too, slightly burned, but I could live with that. So when all four components blend well together you have a perfect slice of pizza!"
23-Feb-20,"Pizza doesn't look like much but wow I am loving NY style pizza. The whole reheating pizza thing seems off at first but trust me, the process works! This ensures every slice is super hot and crispy when you order! I really enjoyed the simplicity of their pizza and it's a quick and super satisfying bite. Wish we had this in SJ."
22-Feb-20,"We had a horrible experience ordering from Joe's Pizza. The pizza arrived undercooked and all the toppings had slid to one side of the box. When we called the restaurant they accused the doorman (who never touched the box) then they accused us of ruining the pizza on the 20ft walk from our door to our table. The pizza was inedible and the service is crazy. We live in Manhattan. To assume we would be trying to scam some company for a 25$ tab, is ridiculous. There are a million other place to visit. SKIP JOE'S"
21-Feb-20,"Carmine location is better but it's a solid option for Times Square. They're open fairly late and it's a good intro to NYC pizza for the tourist. Place is buzzing at all times but crowds don't linger for long. Most times everyone is pretty hospitable when it comes to the chili flakes, basil, and garlic powder. Do get yourself some of that Mexican Coca Cola though. I can't think of a better complement to a plain slice. No restrooms..."
21-Feb-20,"it was late and we wanted pizza. Everything around us was closed and Joe's kept coming up. We hopped in an uber and walked in with not much of a wait. I got a pepperoni, mushroom sausage slice and my lady friend got a pepperoni and cheese slice. He tossed them into the oven to crisp them up and the 2 slices with a soda came to only $11.The crust was thin and crispy and held up well to the toppings. We both thoroughly enjoyed our slices while sitting in the front window.Great pizza for a late night fix."
20-Feb-20,"Me and my GF had just landed in the city and we were looking for something quick to eat since we were starving, great pizza and great price. Cant really ask for more than that."
20-Feb-20,"NY pizza at it's finest. So so good! Very busy, not much seating. I highly recommend this place."
19-Feb-20,"Ordered delivery to our hotel as the front desk person at Staypineapple highly recommended it. We got a Sicilian pie with sausage, peppers and onion. Even though delivery time was estimated to be 60 minutes, our food arrived within 25 minutes. Delivery person was so nice. Pizza was AMAZING. I'm from Philly, and although nothing beats NYC, our area has some standout pizza joints. The crust was crispy, airy, and moist. Sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. Toppings were evenly distributed and the sausage was real Italian style- not the crumbly, dry crap you'd find at lesser quality restaurants. Sauce was neither bitter nor too sweet with complex flavor. They made sure to add plenty of napkins, plates, red pepper flakes, oregano, and garlic powder on the side. I don't even like pizza that much, but this was ON POINT and will 100% be my go-to pizza every single time I'm in this area. The menu consists of only pizza and salads. So you're getting fresh, delicious pizza done right."
19-Feb-20,"Horrible experience! I ordered from a hotel while traveling for work. I was so looking forward to a great NYC pizza... I asked them to cook my pizza well done, thin crust. I asked for extra crushed red peppers.My pizza arrived undercooked, not thin crust, no peppers, no napkins or plates and almost cold. The delivery guy just said ""sorry"" when I asked where the peppers were. They didn't care because I had already paid. Never again."
18-Feb-20,My son and I wanted to try an authentic NYC pizza and this place was fairly close to where we were staying.  We braved the weather (30 degrees) on a Saturday night at 8pm.  There was a decent line (past the gift store next door) that moved at an ok space.  I would say we waited about 20 mins.  What I noticed was that there were a constant line of delivery guys picking up their order.  But I don't think that made any difference.  Ambiance:  Very small restaurant.  Mostly bar seating and a few high top.  I sent my son in to try to grab a seat and we got lucky.  Expect others to join you at the high top.  Service:  They are fairly efficient.  There are ton of guys making pizza in the back.  There is a cashier and then a guy taking your order and shoving your slices in the oven.  They seem to have the system down pat.  I would suggest knowing exactly what you want and keep the line moving.Food:  I loved the pizza.  Thin thin crust.  Ample cheese.  My son actually preferred the pizza  at the Joe's in the west village.  But I found the pizza to hit the spot.
18-Feb-20,"We came here at around 10:30 AM after flying back super early (Can never go wrong with pizza for breakfast right?)Food: We ordered a Supreme Pie for the three of us, but we found out one of my friend's couldn't eat it because of his diet so it turned into me and my other friend eating the entire thing. The pizza tasted fabulous; the various toppings were fresh and tasty, the cheese melted well, and the crust was the right amount of crunch and thickness. This was honestly one of the better pizzas I've had over the past few years. Service/Environment: It took around 20 minutes to make the pie, which was fair considering how warm and fresh it was delivered to us. If you don't have the time to wait, you can also order by the slice. (They have pre made pies for this) The restaurant itself isn't very big, so we had to move some things around to fit our pie on the table. I also kept bumping into people by accident and vice versa when I was moving around. The interior also has a bunch of photos of celebrities posing with the owner of the shop, which I thought was a cool touch.Price: An entire Supreme Pie was $30. The other pies were around the same price, give or take depending on the amount of toppings you put on it. This is a pretty fair price for an entire pie I feel (Just don't be like us and split it with just two people lol).Overall: Very fresh and tasty pizza. I can see why so many celebrities have ventured here and why there was a line gathering in front of the store at 10:30 AM. I will definitely be coming back here in the future."
18-Feb-20,"Food arrived cold, pizza was bland and flavorless, and crust was burnt on the bottom. Nothing more to say."
17-Feb-20,"The pizza is not good, the service is terrible, and the place is dirty. There was so much trash everywhere. These people have zero knowledge of what customer service is."
17-Feb-20,Ordered a meaty pizza for delivery around 2am on a Thursday night. The pizza was bland and dough tasted raw. Definitely wouldn't order from them again.
17-Feb-20,"A lot of these popular tourist places disappoint, but not Joe's. Great, basic slice of pizza. The sauce is particularly good. But eat it hot--I got a pizza to go and after walking back to my hotel in the cold it was not nearly as good.Service is very basic and geared towards speed, but appropriately so. There isn't a ton of room so you might eat standing or out on the sidewalk. But darn if it isn't good."
17-Feb-20,"Best pizza I've ever had. The line was out the door, but moved fairly quickly. We visited Joe's twice in a weekend, it was THAT good. Location is small and crowded but we didn't mind. Pizza was thin and crispy. Highly recommend if visiting NYC."
16-Feb-20,"This was the nearest Joe's to my hotel and I had it delivered.  It got to me quite a bit quicker than the estimate.  I had heard so much about this pizza that I was prepared to be let down, but it really is great pizza.  I want to try some of the other well known pie places while I'm here, but it's really tempting to get Joe's again"
16-Feb-20,"Joe's is the prototypical New York slice. The pizza here is very much no-frills and bare essentials -- simple, but time-tested.I live nearby, so often find myself giving into temptation and grabbing a single cheese slice on my way home. It's not my absolute favorite NY slice, but I definitely enjoy and savor it every time.And for a by-the-slice pizza joint, this place actually has a decent amount of seating. I rarely have trouble finding a spot when strolling in solo-mode.For natives or not, Joe's is definitely worth a visit."
15-Feb-20,Loved it!! Does live up to the hype. I would definitely return if I was in the time square area. It's a good quick bite. Limited seating. Pizza is a nice think crust.
13-Feb-20,"Happy I got a great shot, however pizza was not as good I expected honestly. The sauce was good but the cheese wasn't melty and delicious as I recalled traditional New York Styled Pizza to be."
13-Feb-20,"My favorite slices in NYC. I've lived in Manhattan for six years, and didn't start going to Joe's until this past year. I feel like I've been living under a rock now that I know the magic of Joe's pizza.What to get? THE SURPREME! It's a perfectly thin slice of pizza with lots of meat. Fold it in half and chow down like a New Yorker. Service  - Given the constant crowds, Joe's funnels customers through like a well oiled conveyor belt. Everyone knows to be quick to order, pay, and rush to a counter or simply stand outside to inhale their slice(s). I'm really hungry typing this review right now....but I'm in Cali so I'll have to deal. You guys go get'em."
12-Feb-20,This is definitely the place to get an affordable ny slice. Even when the line is long (which is usually all the time) they get through people pretty whisky so you're not waiting that long.
12-Feb-20,Best pizza !  We always make sure to get this for our office events!! Go for the spider pizza. Top notch!
11-Feb-20,"Joe's is not the best pizza in NYC, but it is, I think, the quintessential nyc slice. On my most recent visit, I had a slice of pepperoni and a slice of tomato/mozzarella. The latter slice could have been hotter, but the pepperoni was great. Usually it's better."
11-Feb-20,Late night saving grace! We were staying in the Moxy and their kitchen closed. We asked the bartenders if they minded if we ordered a pizza (we needed a late night bite to save us from a rocking hangover the next day). They obliged and then we donated the leftover pizza to the staff. Pizza was delicious and appreciated the late delivery!
11-Feb-20,The famous joes pizza in the city I prefer the one in Brooklyn but the pizza was great but it was too touristy for me a lot of photos on the wall if you saw the original spider man than you have seen this pizzz ship before
9-Feb-20,"For NYC pizza this is solid 3-star pizza. You won't be disappointed. If this pizza joint were anywhere outside of NYC, it would be 4-stars."
8-Feb-20,"The pizza was amazing! The line wasn't too bad, and we got our food fairly quickly. I love the thin crispy crust and the supreme pizza is definitely worth getting over the normal cheese. The caprese was pretty good too, but our slice wasn't warmed up enough and so the cheese wasn't completely melted and the tomatoes were cold."
8-Feb-20,This is the first pizza place that I ever had a New York City got me a slice of pepperoni pizza and a Diet Coke and I felt like a real New Yorker it was awesome really enjoyed it the scenery was great sitting there next to time square eaten slice of Joe's pizza can't get much more New York that
8-Feb-20,I loved the pizza here. This is a crowded and popular spot. Worth stopping by to get a slice.
7-Feb-20,First time time trying pizza in New York and it was pretty good. Got a pepperoni pizza and the slice was pretty big and not oily. I enjoyed the decor of this place and I liked seeing how they hang up all the famous people pictures up on the wall which was pretty interesting to look at. I did notice that they deliver so thats a plus if your a local in New York. As far as seating there is some seating but can get full at times.
7-Feb-20,I mean come the hell on. It's joes.  I got my wife grab me a few slices and bringing to back to Cali cuz I miss it so
6-Feb-20,"Legit the best pizza I've ever had in my life! If you're looking for absolutely delicious pizza made the right way, this is the place!"
3-Feb-20,"Went in to get a slice.  It was good but there was no place to sit so we took it to go and went back to the hotel lobby.  Wife's pepperoni slice was really burnt and I don't think she would go back,  but my supreme was great and I would like some more.  But it's Joes so you got to go.  Right??"
3-Feb-20,Love Joes Pizza but this location is giving them a bad name. Staffed by rude losers who are incredibly rude to customers and clearly hate their job. Pizza also not as good here. The kind of service  that can make a life long customer never come back
2-Feb-20,"There are so many places to eat in Midtown Manhattan, but this is definitely the place to go for pizza. The line seemed long but went very quickly. The pizzas are fresh, and they throw them back in the oven to warm up once you order it. Will definitely go again!"
2-Feb-20,"Delicious: enough said. Popped in to get a pizza fix. My crust connoisseur vibes were thrilled. I live for a quality crust, and this did not not disappoint at all! The pies are coming out often so everything is super fresh and having to go through a reheating cycle. The one with pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms and onions was primo! Good spot to see what NYC pizza is famous for."
2-Feb-20,"Writing this review after getting delivery from them twice now. We never request, but their deliver with their pies always come with a surplus of spices (red pepper flakes, garlic, and oregano), paper plates, and a stack napkins. Their delivery always come faster than their estimated time.. even today (super bowl night)!But onto the important question. Is their pizza good? Short answer: yes. Longer answer: get the pepperoni and mushroom (proof in picture: only cheese Bc the roni/shroom was gone in 5 secs)"
2-Feb-20,"Wow just wow, this pizza is just beyond amazing. It blows the pizza that I have at home away by mile. Not to mention that even with a long line outside I still got my pizza under 10 minutes. IT has fast service and with great quality!"
1-Feb-20,"It was a good slice.  We got just cheese and they reheated it to a bit black which threw us off but it was a good flavor, nice crust consistency and it is packed all the time so you know it must be pretty good"
28-Jan-20,"At $3 for a slice of cheese, $4 for pepperoni, you better be getting something quality. This hits the mark. Service is fast, and at 3pm there was no line. Given the location, can't say anything bad about the place. In fact, it's quite good."
25-Jan-20,"The infamous Joe's Pizza! We couldn't go to NYC and not go to this place to get the pizza. They have such great reviews and with over a thousand people on Yelp reviewing it, we had to try it for ourselves! Ah, a new york slice .. this is what it's about! The slices are known to be HUGE and how big it really is! I am someone that can eat pizza all day, everyday so this was a pizza dream. Pizzas aren't too thin, but they are thinner than some other places. There are peppers and cheese on the tables if you need them. I would definitely come back!"
24-Jan-20,Grabbed a slice a few weeks ago when visiting nyc. Good pizza good price. Quick service. Few spots to sit otherwise plan to tAke and go.
22-Jan-20,"Pretty good place to take your stab at New York pizza while visiting! A glass display will reveal the many choices and I love being able to order by the slice to try several toppings. However, be warned that the slices are huge.I really enjoyed the white pizza, sicilian pizza, and a pepperoni/mushroom/red onions combo. The toppings were flavorful and thus, made the pizza satisfying. The price is also pretty affordable compared to other popular pizzerias in NYC. The only thing I'd want different is to not have the pizza overcooked. Some of the slices were pretty charred to the point of burnt. This made for a chewy, almost inedible dough that was not pleasant to eat."
21-Jan-20,"Best pizza i had in my entire life. if you want that classic pizza without all the bullshit, this is the place to go. NO CAP"
21-Jan-20,"I didnt believe the hype, but I have to admit, I was wrong. I was told by people to try Joe's Pizza in NYC because its the best pizza in town, but at first I just didn't believe the hype. One day, when I was craving pizza, and about to go to one of the smaller pizza stores to grab a 99 cent slice, I thought to myself to just give Joe's Pizza a chance. Upon arriving, there was already a line all the way outside, and the wait was approximately 15 minutes. Just from seeing the line, I got excited to just try the pizza and see for myself if the hype was justified, and after having my first bite, it totally was. I had a slice of Pepporoni, and a slice of Margerita pizza, and I regret not getting a whole pie. The crust of the pizza was made perfectly, the ingredients on the pizza tasted fresh, and I was one happy customer at the end of the day. I will be back soon as a soon as I am back back in NYC."
20-Jan-20,"Be prepared for the possibility to stand outside in line waiting to place your order. This is a very popular pizzeria in Manhattan and it gets crowded. However, the service is great and moves really fast so you won't be waiting long. I tried a slice of the  White and Caprese. Both slices were very light and fresh. You can taste the natural ingredients. Plus, the pizza wasn't greasy at all! Because of the crowd, I took my pizza to-go. I forgot to add Parmesan and crushed red pepper though!  The pizza was good without it, but it would have been even better with it."
19-Jan-20,"It was ok, but might be a little over hyped.  It is in Times Square.  There was a bit of a line but it moved quickly.  Best pizza we had here, hands down, was a slice of supreme.  Pepperoni, capresse, and Sicilian were all so-so.  Place was crowded inside and had to stand to eat.  At least you get your pizza really fast."
16-Jan-20,This location is very famous so I has to visit. Aside from the fact it was 5min from the hotel I was staying at. It's unfortunate that there's no pizza like this in LA. Can't wait to go back for more Joe's Pizza.
16-Jan-20,It's an ok pizza. I've had better. I'm from NC and had high expectations from this place since the line to get your order placed wraps around the corner but it fell short to be desired when it comes to flavor.  The dough isn't anything spectacular and so is the sauce.  Let me say that our locally owned take and bake has better flavors should surprise the many.  The topping seemed stale/old? perhaps overcooked but this was my first real NY style pizza and was not impressed at all.  Maybe your experience is better than mine but will not wait in line for a subpar pizza.
16-Jan-20,The queue can get long but service is quite fast. Pizza is thin and good especially  when it's just fresh off the oven. Had one pizza slice that was too burnt to my liking.
14-Jan-20,My mom met me in the city and I decided to take her to get Kati roll and than pizza! I knew this had to be good when I saw a like out the door! There were maybe 30 people in front of us but the line moved quickly and the pizza was great 7.5/10! I will definitely be going back for another slice - the slices are $3 and a pie is $21 (for plain cheese pizza) don't miss out!! Especially if you love pizza
13-Jan-20,"I had a cheese pizza with sausage and onions delivered to my nearby hotel by door dash.  DoorDash delivered it within 30 minutes and it was hot.  However the pizza was soggy and tasteless.  The crust was not firm at all and could not hold the cheese, sauce, sausage, or onions.  Everything just fell apart.  I was very disappointed.  I had heard some good things about Joe's and was looking forward to the pizza.  But it was not good at all."
11-Jan-20,"Pizza was under cooked, vegetable toppings crunchy. Little Cesars is better pizza than this."
10-Jan-20,Got Fresh Mozzarella and a slice of Cheese. Not much flavor. Soft and Thin Slice. Wasn't satisfied. Went back to Patzeria Perfect Pizza second time. It has more flavor. Soft and crispy (crunch).
9-Jan-20,Ordered a pizza for delivery while in town for business.  Pizza was delivered on time but crust was burnt!  Every bite had a very unpleasant burnt taste.
8-Jan-20,"I'm not sure what more I can contribute to a business that already has great reviews and over 1000 reviews, but all I can say is that the reviews are correct.  This is the best (NY style) pizza ever.  My goodness.  I don't know what they do because it tastes like heaven.  And the pizza slices are so reasonably priced, I just can't believe something this delicious can be so affordable.  I'm in love.  We tried the pepperoni, white pizza, some sausage one, and the margherita.  Everything was delicious, but my fave is still the classic pepperoni.  What makes this place so perfect?  Is it the hot stringy cheese?  The sweet sauce?  Even the crust is so damn good.  And what also amazes me is that it's not even that greasy.  How is that possible?  Magic.  It's magic, I tell you.  Lines can be long, but we never waited because we always came before or around 11 am.  But shortly after 11, lines will get long fast.  But the staff seems extremely efficient so I wouldn't let that stop you from getting a slice of HEAVEN.Waaaah Joe, I'll be dreaming of you while I'm in LA.  Sigh."
7-Jan-20,"Good quality, affordable pizza.  There was a line out the door but it moves quickly.  Definitely a must when in New York."
7-Jan-20,Great pizza and the price for a huge pie was pretty awesome too. They delivered to our hotel & the service was super fast!
7-Jan-20,"We stood in line for 20 minutes in the freezing cold to try this place...and it was well worth it! It has great reviews for a reason. They are very reasonably priced, located in a convenient spot and have a great selection of delicious pizza. I tried their spinach pizza and it was really flavorful. It was nice to see the pictures of all the celebrities who have cons their before too."
7-Jan-20,"I'm giving this joint 5 stars simply for the experience of buying a whole pizza in New York City. It was so different, and so cool! We came through on a Monday evening around 7:00 pm. There was a line out the door, but we were prepared to wait. It only took about 15 minutes for us to reach the counter. You can buy by the slice or a whole pie. We opted for a whole pie to take back to our hotels. It was $25.00. Not a bad price to feed your family in NYC! Our pizza was ready in about 20 minutes-- we left and came back. The pizza was truly NY style... thin, bendy, and delicious. We really enjoyed it! We'll definitely stop by again next time we're in town!"
7-Jan-20,"Best pizza around hands down! They constantly have a line around the block of both locals and tourists trying to get themselves a slice of that goodness. They have pizza by the slice ready to order or by the pie. I shared a pepperoni and cheese pie with the family and we couldn't get enough. The slices are huge, cheesy, and delicious. They have mostly the basics when it comes to pizza toppings, if you want a customized pizza I recommend calling ahead of time to bypass the long lines and wait times. The place is very small so most people just put some garlic powder and pepper flakes on their pizza and bounce. Weirdly enough, I found myself just standing around outside eating my slice amongst other people doing the same, and we all kind of bonded over how great the pizza was. Fun tip, I recommend looking around inside at all the pictures of celebrities that frequent this place, apparently this place was featured in one of the older spiderman movies! If you really want the authentic NY pizza experience, go to Joe's!"
5-Jan-20,"I was skeptical- pizza place right around Times Square? Can't be great...WRONG! This is the best pizza in Manhattan. The line is long but don't let that intimidate you, high turn over and seats open up fairly quick. They really mastered the slice. Also, this is the pizza place from Spider-Man so if you're from out of town and a movie buff it's an added bonus to visit. The store can get a bit dirty occasionally with napkins on the floor but I don't even care...the pizza is SO GOOD I will happily leave with a couple of shame napkins on my shoe. PS: the only reason I didn't post a picture of the pizza is because it was literally gone seconds after it was in my hands."
5-Jan-20,"Our first time and definitely not our last! Delivered to our hotel. Fresh, hot, crispy crust amazing sauce and cheese-perfect ratio! Will be dreaming about it! That good!"
4-Jan-20,"The worst pizza I ever had, got food poisoning and have been throwing up pizza all night, absolutely the worst, overcooked crust possibly spoiled tomatoes or mushrooms"
4-Jan-20,Classic NY SLICE and it does not get any better.  This is pizza at its best.  Just the way it should be.  A perfect crunch when you first bit it and then just a little chew.  Sauce and cheese ratio is perfect.  When you eat a slice here you know why pizza is a love food but the problem is you get this slice anywhere!! Some say they never had a bad slice of pizza. Some say they never had bad sex.  Well that's because they probably have nothing to compare either to.  When you eat a slice at Joe's it ruins you.  Not many other slices anywhere will hold up!!  I will no longer eat average or bad pizza.  It will HAVE TO Excellent or nothing!!
4-Jan-20,"This was on my list of MUST GOS for New York! On the first day, my bf and I walked past Joe's Pizza and there was NO LINE, so we were kind of skeptical, thinking hm, maybe its not that great until we realized that it was almost midnight and people don't usually eat that late on a week day haha! When we did decide to give it a try, we ended up waiting in a long line because it was during lunch rush hour. It wasn't too bad because the line goes QUICK! We both got pepperoni and OH MY GOD. I didn't think Pizza could taste so good. Not sure how to describe it but it tasted so authentic and fresh. Thin, cheesy, with lots of flavour! Ended up going back again on our last day (keep in mind we were only in New York for 6 days...)! Definitely a must try! If you think the price is bad, wait until you go to other pizza places to see the prices even more inflated!"
4-Jan-20,"Seriously so GOOD! I never believed that New York has the beat pizza until I came here . I seriously crave Joes pizza and unfortunately for myself I live hundreds of miles away. So enjoy this pizza while you can , don't skip this place. Actual interior isn't too large but it's good enough for me ."
3-Jan-20,"It's good, very good. Usually an enormous wait outside the place. So plan accordingly the place is fast therefore knowing what you want ahead of time is best to avoid an embarrassing tourist moment. Drinks are the standard bottled everywhere else. Open 24 hours a day. Prices are reasonable especially for the area."
3-Jan-20,"Best pizza I've ever had. Hands down. Got there at 3am and there was still a line. There is a reason why. Perfect amount of crunch, great sauce, toppings were delicious. Highly recommend."
3-Jan-20,When you are in New York it's worth the wait. The secret is that because of the high turn the pizzas are really fresh.$4/slice and you need to spend $5 to use your credit card. I would recommend to come hungry and get 2 slices. This place is absolutely delicious. It's worth the walk from Time Square but make sure you buffer the time for the wait.You can also order a whole pizza ahead so that would save you time with the line up.Will make sure to come back every time I'm in New York New York!
3-Jan-20,"My boyfriend and I went to New York City for New Year's Eve. We successfully watched the ball drop, but felt our trip wouldn't be complete without a slice of NY style pizza. One of his coworkers had recommended Joe's Pizza. When we arrived, the line was out the door. Thankfully, it moved very quickly and within a few minutes, we were inside and able to order. I ordered a slice of pepperoni and he ordered a slice of pepperoni and a slice of spinach. The slices had crisp thin crusts, the perfect amount of marinara sauce, and delicious cheese. The best part was we were able to eat the pizza on Broadway in Times Square. Such an incredible experience!"
3-Jan-20,"NYC staple.. I was so pumped to take my husband here for the first time and to see his face when he truly understood what it's like to have a slice of pizza from NYC.. truly magical!!!!!! Pizza slices are large,affordable, and above all absolutely delicious!!"
3-Jan-20,Definitely lives up to expectations of being the best pizza around times Square. I'd highly recommend going here if you are by times Square.
2-Jan-20,An amazing place to eat! The line can look intimidating but it is well worth the wait. This is a great spot to check out if you are visiting the city and you're craving some pizza. Would definitely recommend.
2-Jan-20,"Pizza was ok for a NY pizza, but ordered pepperoni and received a cheese, have hungry kids and didn't want to wait again for a new and deal calling!"
2-Jan-20,"Dropped by a hour or so before closing after a night out with friends to grab a quick bite. The usually line can be up to 40 minutes or more but the service was quick and everyone was super friendly. Took 10 minutes MAX!! Even if we had to wait longer, the food is definitely worth it! We grabbed a few different slices, loved the simplicity and flavor of the fresh mozzarella slice. My friend recommended us this place saying it's the best pizza in NYC and that he's been eating here since he was young. And let me tell ya, Joe's Pizza defiantly lives up to the name. Both of our slices and all of our friends were awesome! Fresh, flavorful, and the prices aren't bad either ;)  (Not the best photo, sorry we were hungry!)"
1-Jan-20,"Good pizza! There was a hugeeee line outside but it went by pretty fast. If you are getting a pie, I definitely recommend that you preorder so you don't have to wait in line. They only have 1 size for a pie, large. They also sell shirts and sweaters."
1-Jan-20,"My first New York City Pizza. Not bad, but wouldn't be near the top 20 in Pittsburgh pizza. I am truly surprised."
31-Dec-19,Tried to surprise my husband with pizza and got this burnt trash. Came all the way from California to apparently find a new pizza joint. So sad
30-Dec-19,Cold and without any special taste. I think in your country they make better pizzas than Joe's.
30-Dec-19,Did not like the atmosphere and they do not wash there hands. Don't bring your kids here because they say bad words at the kitchen.
28-Dec-19,"YUM! The line was really long and went out the door. We probably waited half an hour to 45 min there. The slice is your typical thin crust NYC pizza. It's on the crispier side since it's reheated in the oven a second time as you order, but I loved the crunch. (Friends complained that the crust was dry.) The pizza sauce is unique--bright and zesty but not too acidic. Slices are $3 each for a huge piece."
27-Dec-19,"Disappointed. I type this at 330am after finishing my pie. I initially walked by this place several times refusing to wait in line. Finally no line and rushed in. Pepperoni please!Mediocre pizza at best. Pizza sauce not much taste, and the crust taste hard like cardboard (no flavor). I live to eat pizza and was expecting so much more. To me what I think is amazing pizza, is 50/50 pizza in Las Vegas. Bunch of pics of celebs on the wall. I am unsure if they go to another location that might be better? But this TS location was nothing spectacular. I would never return and pay $4 a slice. Again not terrible but nothing to go out of my for or wait in a line. Around the corner out of desperation is .99cents a slice which was in my opinion of equal value if not maybe a better taste. I seriously hate to say it, but it's true. Having passed Joes seeing the line I ended up at the discount pizza place which was ok for the price.The staff was prompt and nice. Location and tables not clean. But for the volume of Customers I guess you don't really have to try and impress."
27-Dec-19,The Best Pizza in New York ! Must go and get a huge slice or a whole pizza ! You want regret it !!
24-Dec-19,Ordered a whole pizza delivery waited for an hour Bottom was so burnt could only taste the burned dough. :( not a good idea to send it as a delivery order when i cant wait for it to be refunded or exchanged.
23-Dec-19,OverratedOverly hyped by celebrities Sauce is sweet. Not a lot is on their cheese slices.Caprese slice is decent.Always a line but goes quicklyBest part is the dough... thin and crunchy Two slices cost about 9 dollars
23-Dec-19,"Joe's is one of the best in the city. Pizza is the real deal. Excellent sauce, quality cheese, thin crust.....but not too thin! Good size slice for the money. It was a cold day (20 degrees), so we took our time eating, but they didn't mind. The group of us kept buying slices. If you're doing your own pizza tour (in & out for a slbe sure to stop here. My opinion, it's one of the top five in the city. Updated:  another holiday trip to NYC and Joe's was good to us! Best pizza in the city. Nice weather this time too!"
23-Dec-19,The pizza here is classically simplistic. Airy dough that is thin and somewhat bland. Combined with the perfect thickness of melted cheese and scattering of toppings. The turn over of pies here is insane. They had half a dozen people making/cooking pies just to keep pace with the line that never once was short enough to fit inside the restaurant. The pizza tastes fresh and has a lightness to it that lends itself to just stopping in for a slice as a snack vs a meal. I saw several people order pies to go. I bet a whole pie is a great meal but i think this quality lends itself to slices vs meals. I suppose there's only one way to find out.
22-Dec-19,"This place is wonderful! I went twice on my last trip to New York earlier this month. The prices are very reasonable, $11 for two HUGE pieces and a Pellegrino? Can't beat it.The employees there work quickly which is nice because most of the time the line is out the door, so it's nice that they keep it going. The pizza was fresh both times I went in and they were continuously cooking. It's clean and cute inside. The only thing is, it's small and packed, so it may be difficult to find a seat. But a lot of people just stand at the tables inside or the bar outside- part of the New York experience. Highly recommend and will definitely be making it a priority to go whenever I'm there. Worth checking out!"
22-Dec-19,"My first NY pizza was at Joe's and it honestly didn't quite live up to the hype. It was still great, but nothing extremely special compared to a few whole in the wall places I visited in Brooklyn during my short stay. Still great and would love to try and order a large pizza so I can get a fresh slice!"
21-Dec-19,"This is supposed to be a food dead zone but Joe's Pizza certainly didn't get that memo.  They are serving up delicious slices in quick fashion.  The sauce, cheese, crust ratio is working for me.  This is an old fashioned slice of straight up pizza, not messed around with.  They also offer a nice array of specialty slices.Nice inexpensive way to take a break from walking around on a cold NYC day.  Definitely recommend it."
21-Dec-19,"Heard a lot of great things about Joe's being the best, so I was expecting super amazing pizza that would blow me away. Well, it was just good. Tasty, definitely. Their regular cheese pizza doesn't really do much wrong but there's still room for improvement within the flavor itself. With a pizza that's praised so highly, I feel like there shouldn't be room for improvement. It didn't live up to the hype but I don't regret going, because it's still good pizza. But it's nothing I would say someone absolutely has to try if they're visiting new york..."
21-Dec-19,Best pizza ever. I'm from New York and this is my go to place for pizza.  This is my favorite place and the customer service is always great and delicious and and if you really want to get a real feel of New York pizza then you have to try this place. Now it is down in time square so the line is all the way around the corner but moves fast. Just do yourself a favor and go.
21-Dec-19,"Delicious, fresh pizza!!! Had classic cheese slices. Famous, crunchy, tasty pizza. Midtown, west Manhattan. Went at 12n. Expect a line. It's that popular. You eat standing up. Thank you for having real NY pizza."
20-Dec-19,"Ugh, asshole on the phone. We order from here from time to time, always takes forever. Tonight took 2 hours. Guy on the phone was a jerk, comically so. An hour in we called to ask about where the pizza is, he was like oh yes it is on its way. 20 minutes later, called back, he said oops i dunno, we'll send you another. 20 minutes later I called back, at this point I'm HANGRY it's 9pm. He says it's not his fault, he doesn't know where the pizza is, he won't refund us because the pizza has been made he just doesn't know where it is (!?!?!?) I tell him this is shitty, he says ""ok bye bye"" (!!!!) This is my first ever yelp review because I am HANGRY and also, stunned at the rude.  I'm going to cast a spell on you and your slimey pizza."
19-Dec-19,"Authentic New York: from the line and crowd, to the characters behind the counter and the delicious pizza. A great place and must taste while in NYC."
19-Dec-19,Simply the best pizza in NYC - had it every night I was there. I do agree with other reviews that you should stick with the pepperoni. So good
18-Dec-19,"It's very hard to find a good new York slice,what a notice is most if these pizza shop in the city are not serving good slices,the slices are greasy the bread taste terrible the sauce is two much,I ate at Joe's pizzeria the other day for the first time what a slice #Wow delicious I ate three of those bad boys i was surprised how good it was thin sliced not to much sauce and not to much cheese just right,the dough was crispy and delicious now that's a slices,8.9 is my score..."
18-Dec-19,The hype is real and well worth the wait in line!  Ordered 4 different slices to share with me & my bf. My favorite would be the white slice! It's the best one I've tried. mushroom/pepperoni/onion was my 2nd favorite. All 4 slices we tried did not disappoint. Appreciate that the staff is really quick and friendly
16-Dec-19,"On my last trip to New York this is the pizza place I went to get a slice. This was worth it, I sent pictures to all my friends saying 'this is the perfect slice of New York style pizza'. Honestly the best food I had while I was in the city for the week, I will return for sure with friends."
15-Dec-19,"We were on a quest to find the best NY Pizza! This place definitely it!! We got the caprese, fresh mozzarella, mozzarella with spinach, pepperoni, pepperoni with onion, sausage, and mushrooms. YOU MUST GET THE FRESH MOZARELLA and CAPRESE. They toast your pizza when you order so it has a crispy crust. The pizza is not greasy at all and folds perfectly!!! Tip: The fresh mozarella topped with powdered garlic and red pepper takes the pizza to the next level!! Only like a handful of seating inside (along the walls). Theres like 2 or 3 tables where you can stand and eat your pizza. I would say max 25 to 30 people inside at a time. Line goes by quick so wait is not absurd. I will say we tried the 3 top rated pizza places around time square and this was the best one."
14-Dec-19,"Ordered pizza delivery to my hotel & upon delivery the guy did not have the 2 water bottles I ordered. I called him to let him know and he said he'd be back in 5 minutes. However, 10 minutes passed as I sat waiting in the lobby & nothing.... I tried calling him back but he then began forwarding my calls. I called the restaurant and the guy said he'll call the delivery guy to come back, so I said okay. But 30 minutes pass & nothing.... I just gave up. I wasn't upset at the fact that he forgot... whatever I didn't get the water, but it was the fact that both delivery guy & restaurant employee ensured me he'd come back to deliver but then I just sat & waited with no communication back to me. I ended up calling the restaurant and the guy told me to call grubhub to get my refund and he said 'i'm sorry, I couldn't send him back. We are very busy.' It would have been nice to get a call back to let me know that!!! Instead I waited.....On top of all of this, the pizza we got was burnt. See pictures below.... This was my first time using the delivery option on yelp using grubhub. Worst delivery experience. Never had to deal with this with uber eats or postmates."
14-Dec-19,Delivery took for everrrrrr. Said 40-50mins but was legitimately 2hrs. Pizza was cold and mediocre. Called grubhub and the restaurant twice. Disappointing.
12-Dec-19,I just don't get the hype. Where is the tomato sauce? Whats so special about the dough?
12-Dec-19,If you're near time square don't miss out on this pizza. It doesn't disappoint and it's fast & good service. Joe's is some of the best pizza you can get in the big apple!
12-Dec-19,Had a slice of the supreme and slice of Sicilian. If there was a place like this where I live I would weigh at least 500 pounds within a few months. Thankfully I got some grease on my sleeve and was able to enjoy the scent of greatness  throughout the evening.
8-Dec-19,"Line out the door, fast paced moved right along, it was as good as all the locals described. Worth the wait! Funny there was a pot truck Parked in front"
7-Dec-19,"Am I the only crazy person who doesn't find this pizza to be particularly phenomenal? Got pepperoni and white slice. Nothing out of the ordinary? Lines long, workers are nice, it's cozy and busy inside but other than that.. I've tried better pizza this is solid for a drunk night. Also white pizza kinda had a gross ashy burnt taste to it"
7-Dec-19,"So when they say quintessential slice of Pizza in NY, it's not exaggeration by any stretch. If you have a chance to dig into 'any' one  of their slices, you'll agree. We tried a slice of almost all variations and they were close to perfection. Thin slices with lightly crispy bottom and topped with cheese and toppings loaded with flavor. Droool....Service - 4/5Food - 4/5Ambience - 4/5"
7-Dec-19,"Go! It's worth it. So many selections, if you want the true New Yorker experience. I would go!"
7-Dec-19,Life changing pizza for someone from California (me) experiencing New York pizza for the first time. I will say that the best slices are the pepperoni and the white pizza. Didnt care for the sausage and pepperoni one nor the white pizza with spinach. So good and quick. I have to come here every time I'm in New York for work.
7-Dec-19,The place was tiny.  The cheese and pepperoni slice was pretty good but the basil tomato mozzarella my wife got was not.  Cheese wasn't melted and she didn't finish it.  I would eat it again but it was nothing special IMO.
4-Dec-19,The pizza is great but not worth the wait. Go when there's no line or a short line. This short line in the this photo is a 5-10 min wait. Try the Sicilian and love their mushrooms
4-Dec-19,"Over the summer, we took a trip to NYC and this was our first stop for dinner as soon as we landed.  Luckily, we got to come here twice since it was within walking distance of our hotel.  You can easily pinpoint the location of this franchised pizza parlor.  Once you see the long line out the door then you have found it. Joe's Pizza is a more casual restaurant.  You order at the counter as you get a glimpse of the tasty pizza options.  Although, it's jampacked with pizza lovers, the service is super fast.  There is limited seating but most customers order their whole pie as takeout.  You can take a seat outside along the bench lined streets.  I'm not really a pizza fan but when I took my first bite of the pepperoni pizza, it was divine.  You couldn't ask for anything more authentic than this pizza.  The slices are huge and you must fold it in half to eat it the right way.  The sauce to cheese ratio was perfect.  The crust is thin and crispy.  You receive your pizza slice fresh and hot as they pop in the oven for a minutes.  I totally became a pizza fan overnight.  The only downfall is Cali does not have any good NY style pizza joints.  Oh well, I'm willing to travel across the states for amazing pizza.  The scenery and food is worth it as well."
3-Dec-19,"Such satisfying, classic NY slice of pizza.  Thin crust that's slightly crispy with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  Grab a slice, you wont be disappointed!"
3-Dec-19,"There is a line out the door for a $3 cheese slice when there are $1 pizza joints on every other block because this pizza is worth it. Oh so worth it.  Slightly sweet sauce and piping hot cheese that will take the skin off the roof of your mouth if you have problems delaying your gratification and take a bite before you hit the cash register. (Not that I would know from experience. Ouch.). I wanted a white pizza slice but I couldn't risk garlic overload before a client meeting. Since it opens at 10am and closes at 4am, I may be back before my 24 hour NYC trip ends."
2-Dec-19,"I am born and raised in New York and I judge good pizza by whether or not you can make a great classic cheese slice and Joe's Pizza does!!! I was shopping at Macy's in Black Friday and asked the sales person where I could find a good slice and they said Joes. The line was out the door!!! I took that as a good sign. Let me tell you, those guys make that line move. They are so efficient that we were being served in no time and it was a cold day so I appreciated that. I got a cheese slice and a spinach slice-SO GOOD!!! My cousin got a Sicilian and was in heaven. The place is small but in an authentic New York pizza shop sort of way. You don't linger here. Eat your pizza, chat for a sec and get out! You don't linger but you don't feel rushed. You stop while shopping or doing whatever. This is not your sit down and contemplate life sort of place. My cousin and I said it was our best slice or at least top 2. It was the perfect place to take my mentee for her first slice of New York pizza. Loved it!!!"
2-Dec-19,Wait in line and get a slice of some NYC pizza pie. It's amore. Seating is crowded and cramped and you might get lucky by the time you order and get your slices. Don't get fancy - you won't find fancy here. Order slices add a topping or two. It's gets heated up and you fold it and eat it. Kapeesh?
2-Dec-19,"My friend and I were over by 38th and 9th on a cold and windy day and I was craving a good-ass slice of pizza. Immediately Joe's Pizza came to mind as my go-to spot *somewhat* in the area. I was in heels and unable to walk in my full on NY sprint and the wind was brutal. We passed about 5 or 6 pizza spots on the way and my friend was about to lose his patience. We get to Joe's pizza and unexpectedly, there's a line out the door on a Thursday night. We still wait and let me tell you, he was singing me praises of glory after his first bite because man, is this pizza STUPID delicious. It's more than a classic NY slice, it's the refined slice of NY style pizza. I ordered two tomato basil slices because I'm basic when I comes to my pizza tastes. Dress it up with some crushed red pepper and oregano and BAM. I felt moved to make a plan for world peace after my first few bites. I can't even explain how sad I was when it was over. I should have bought 4 slices. We turned around to watch a couple behind us eat their slice as deliciously and savagely as we did just to vicariously relive the experience through them. Just typing this review up is making my heart ache with yearning for this amazing human creation.Anyway, TLDR-this pizza is the bomb.com and if you are in midtown in NY it is a must that you go here."
1-Dec-19,"Yup it was good. Good service too, the guy behind the counter gave me a second slice for free since he said the first was too small. Great pizza, great people."
29-Nov-19,"3.5 I'd say. It's open late night, line moved quick, condiments we're available, food was consistently pretty good getting it late night. You'll be one amongst many tho, cuz everyone gets out of the club at the same time, there's limited space to begin with, and the battle of the bulge is real. Ask for what you need from others since the spice or grated cheese you're looking for can be truly nomadic while you eat and won't stay in one place the whole time. Just take the pie with you though and forget about the need for counter space if you don't need to. Spice your slice the way you want it and runaway. Everyone crams. Personally I like space sl the slices being foldable and the crust not giving way was pretty good for my needs.I'd come back in after a night of drinking when nothing else is open and the cart food isn't what i crave at the moment."
28-Nov-19,"Joe's Pizza does not disappoint. It is located in the heart of Times Square, so it is conveniently located for dine in, take out, or delivery. In fact, we received our delivery in less than 20 minutes. It is authentic New York pizza, some of the best we've had in the city. The only thing you should be aware of is that are no non pork meat toppings. Other than that Joe's is great."
27-Nov-19,Unpopular opinion. I kind of found Joe's pizza overrated. Yes I'm a tourist so I had to check it out because so many people told me to go. Honestly all of the other pizza joints I went to were a lot better. There was a bit of a wait when I went but the line went by really fast. When I got my pizza it was cold and really didn't taste all that great. I will say I was walking around(getting lost) since 6AM and that was the next time I ate which was around 1ish so I was Hangry. Maybe that's why it wasn't all that great? I'm not too sure. All I know is that I would probably wouldn't get it another try unless someone bought it for me. I'm not saying it was horrible. It just didn't live up to the hype. I was expecting big things.
23-Nov-19,"Wow-za!! Had given Joe's Pizza a shot after trying another pizza joint earlier that day and I am so glad I did. Joe's had a crunch to their crust unlike any I've tried and their ingredients tasted so good you can tell they are of higher quality. The prices are more than reasonable for what you're getting - a quality irresistible slice of heaven. If you're in the area, you can not go wrong stopping by here for your pizza fix. It was also really cool to see all the pictures of celebrities that have given this place a visit - many of them more than once!"
23-Nov-19,"Well ladies and gents this is really a tragedy. I'm having a real $&@@& moment here. You know...when I was a kid, climate change wasn't spoken about much, a stogie was a stogie. None of this !&&$ ing vaping cr@p and you really couldn't buy a bad slice in nyc. Dammit I'm telling the truth. Perhaps back then you could even confide in what people said. The reviews that people gave places. It meant something. I'm a New Yorker. Yes this is my city. Our city as well but this place is more mine than any tourists. And we New Yorkers tell it like it is. It's our duty to do this. How this place can be rated 4 stars is a travesty. This is perhaps some of the worst pizza Ive ever had. No taste, chewier than orbitz gum and just plain awful. Don't do it folks. Don't do it. You've been warned!"
23-Nov-19,"Good pepperoni pie with smoky, extra thin crust. Too many pizza shops are so in love with their sauce that they bucket it on until it is overpowering. Thankfully Joes is not one of them. The sauce was rich and flavorful but relatively sparse, which is awesome in my opinion. Having said this was the pie THAT much better than ""authentic"" NY pizza in Nashville? Not really, so one * off for the unrealized super-hype. It arrived plenty fast but only lukewarm but I am putting that on Doordash not Joes. Also pretty pricy, honestly even by NYC standards. All in all though, it was good pie and I will likely return when back in NYC, but maybe brave the lines and eat in next time now that I am sure a magic genie is not going to pop out of the box."
22-Nov-19,This place was really cool nearby Timesquare they they had a lot of pictures of celebrities up in the wall of them trying the pizza also this was the pizza place of where Spiderman two Peter Parker worked at the pizza was good long line but it went by really fast if I am by the area I will definitely try it again.
20-Nov-19,"Line was very long but I had heard great things about this place so I didn't mind the wait.As I ate my pizza, I found myself looking around in awe at all the photos on the wall of celebrities that have gone to Joe's Pizza, the money wall, and all the people spilling in from outside the street.The pizza was pretty delicious with its thin crust and savory pepperoni. However, I was a little disappointed because my pizza was really burnt on the bottom and I felt like some bites were mouthfuls coal.Workers seems extremely stressed and rushed, resulting in burnt pizza."
19-Nov-19,"I love Joe's it might be touristy but i like the pizza and not pricey at all, when in nyc you hace to hace a slice there ‚Äç"
18-Nov-19,Decent NYC pizza but a bit over cooked if you like doughier crust. My wife likes the crust well done so she was happy.  Rest of the pizza was great.
16-Nov-19,If you want to experience the classic NY slice you have to come here. Get the plain cheese slice. None of those fancy slices with spinach or tomatoes. Their pizza is constantly on point and fresh at any time because they're constantly churning due to such high demand for deliciousness. Don't fear the long lines that may form as they usually move pretty quickly
16-Nov-19,"Good slice of Pizza, not that expansive. 14$ for 3 slices. Tasted good. Good value overall to eat something quick !"
12-Nov-19,"My favorites are the white & the cheese! Hands down the best white pizza I have ever had. I'm obsessed. Wait in line, it's so worth it!!"
12-Nov-19,YUM!!! I got the Spinach pizza. It's a fun and easy spot right next to Times Square to have a late night snack (we went past midnight!) and it's cool to see all of the celebrities that have been here as well. Huge slices.
11-Nov-19,"Fantastic pizza. The crust is perfectly crispy and the sauce is magic. I got a slice of pepperoni and loved every bite. This place is usually packed, so prepare to wait. The line moves quickly and Is definitely worth the wait. Joe's is perfect for a quick bite that is sure to satisfy your pizza craving. We stumbled in around midnight on a Sunday and there were 7-10 people in line. Joe's is for sure a must stop when in the city."
11-Nov-19,The fresh mozzerella pie is a 3.5 out of 5 for me. Delivery was fast. Included plates and toppings. The crust is the tastiest part!
10-Nov-19,"Best pizza in NYC hands down!!! Line moves pretty fast and dont forget its a $5 lit to use ur card, no problem for me just got two slices (pepperoni , supreme)"
10-Nov-19,This is the best pizza I've ever had.  . We had to wait in line for about 15 minutes but it was worth the wait.  This location is on Broadway between  40 and 41st street.
9-Nov-19,"I am from Chicago so my thoughts on pizza is much different than NY. I've had NY pies before and they were okay. On my last visit to NY, I had the opportunity to visit Joe's. I thought I'd order a slice but noticed everyone in line ordering two slices thinking that they knew something that I didn't, I followed suit. Well, I'm glad that I did. I must say that I was impressed. The pizza was really good. The best NY pizza I ever had by far. It's no wonder that there were three police squad cars parked outside. I was concerned that there may be a problem in the restaurant. It appears that the only problem was that they were as hungry as me because there several police in line. Good food and quick service is always a plus in my book. I definitely recommend paying them a visit. I will be back the next time I'm in town."
8-Nov-19,It's good. Just get a slice or two. Fold it in half as you walk down the street and enjoy while walking at night. I certainly enjoyed the experience.
7-Nov-19,"Delicious pizza and fast service! I had a slice of cheese, my husband and had a buffalo chicken and a bbq chicken slice. We each enjoyed what we had and the value is great. Not much room to sit but I didn't expect there to be. Definitely check it out"
7-Nov-19,"This spot survives on name alone, idiot tourists who like to be duped and want to name drop that they at Joe's and new New Yorkers who don't know no better or who ate at the original Carmine's location in the early 80's. Such a fall from grace and poor example of what Joe's by the slice used to be. This horrific inedible rendition often comes out of their oven double baked with a black, burnt tasting crust, dry and crackery, cheap sauce and cheese, with no flavor. This is a hard pass and should be avoided at all costs.  Go visit nearby Patsy's or Grimaldi's instead, Roberta's, Totonno's, Keste or any number of spots that have overtaken Joe's by the slice for a really long time now."
6-Nov-19,Best pizza Of All Time!! Crust is thin but not burnt. Cheese pizza has such amazing flavor blend of the right amount of sweet sauce with cheese. So happy we were able to enjoy it! Thank you Joe's
4-Nov-19,This is all about New York pizza. Couldn't be happier! Thanks for a great experience!!
4-Nov-19,"I wanted to eat some good NYC pizza while I was here, so went to a high rated yelp recommend place.  The place is very small with kind of a whole in the wall feel.  Line was out the door when I got here at 5 pm on a Thursday.   You can buy pizza by the slice or whole, around 5 buck each slice.  They had bottled sodas and water for purchase.   I got a slice of the caprese and a slice of the supreme.   The pizzas were pretty fresh but they do reheat it in the oven again when you give them your order.  They are thin crust pizzas but there's definitely a chew to the crust.  Nice and crispy but chewy at the same time.  I definitely liked the supreme better than the caprese since the cheese was kind cold on the caprese and the flavor was very bland, all I tasted was pretty much just tomato.  The line went fairly fast, I had about a 15 min wait time with maybe 10 people in front of me.  They do take credit cards but make sure you don't forget anything since they have a minimum to use a credit card so order your drinks before you pay or you'll have to pay in cash.  With hundreds of pizza places in NYC, this isn't a bad representation, so if you're close by, I would stop by and grab a slice or two."
4-Nov-19,Slice was perfect. Just the right amount of cheese. The crust was perfect. I would eat a slice from here anytime.
4-Nov-19,Delicious! Fast and good pizza! The line was long but I mean what do you expect with it's location the pizza was great
3-Nov-19,"Great late nite pizza joint.   Extremely crowded but we found a seat.     I was told there usually is a line but we didn't encounter that.    Thin, crispy crust which was the best part of the pizza.  Nice NY style pizza."
3-Nov-19,"We walked by Joe's earlier and the line was out the door and down the sidewalk, so we figured it had to be good! It was delicious! We ended up going back when the line wasn't quite as long, but it moves so quickly! It was fun to watch the workers move so fast in the back and continually make and bake the pizzas. I had the margherita pizza and it was really good."
3-Nov-19,Didn't mind waiting in line because the pizza was that good.  All of the pizza is good and you can't go wrong with a slice of New York cheese pizza.  Plus it's close to time square ... limited seating but you aren't there very long because you will want to get in line for another slice.
2-Nov-19,First stop when you touch down in the city. Quick and ez and best pizza spot for the $.
1-Nov-19,New York Pizza staple in the city! Definitely worth a try. Simple but good quality ingredients. The dough is just the right texture. As far as the toppings. I personally enjoyed the simplicity of the cheese pizza. Fold it in half and eat it like a pizza sandwich. For $3-4 per slice it will leave you happy and satisfied. Line can be long specially on peak hours but service is fast and efficient so don't fret and just go in! Take note very limited seating inside but you can get it to go. Get a whole pie for the group and definitely gonna be a crowd pleaser
1-Nov-19,Found out about this place through a bunch of YouTube videos. Planned to stop by on our NYC vacation and was not disappointed. We got there just in time to beat the rush which was intense. Line was out of the shop. My wife and I got a slice each which was the perfect portion because they're huge. I loved your flavor and I think most if all the crunch of the bread and crust. I was expecting some sogginess but that wasn't the case. Once we picked our slices they threw them in the oven so they came out hot and fresh. Would definitely go back again
30-Oct-19,"We wanted to try out a few pizza places after watching Hamilton and this was one of them. Thin crust pizza is solid here wow so good. The way the cheese pulls all gooey from each bite! Oily, but crispy and so worth it. Supreme had legit tasty sausage on it, not that cheap stuff. Decent price and open late at night. The line goes by quickly and they even sell imported coca cola with that real cane sugar for $3. They also sell other bottled soda such as sprite, etc. You really can't go wrong with any of the thin sliced pizzas here-- My favorite is the white. However, when I tried the sicilian slice due to a recommendation, I was not pleased. It was that of the quality from my elementary school cafeteria pizza. Blocky, flavorless, and overall, not that great. Barely any sauce or cheese on it."
30-Oct-19,Can't ever go wrong with the plain pizza here. Can't just eat one either. Always satisfying especially after a movie or broadway show. A variety of toppings and drinks available. Limited seating but usually seating gets freed up fairly quickly.
30-Oct-19,"Classic New York style pizza at TSQ !Dropped by to try a pizza slice on a weekday evening. Being a New Yorker for years now..it's a shame that I hadn't tried Joe's for so long !! There was a line but it moved fast and we were in by the counter in 5 mins or less.They have a standard few choices (6-7 choices - pretty basic ones). The pizza is available by the slice (a hearty big slice - which can be an entire meal in itself) and also by the pie. We got a supreme and a white pizza slice.The base was light, thin and soft - crispy on the edges. The sauce was good - not too tangy. And the meat was fresh and well seasoned. I liked the cheeses too.. especially the ricotta. However the pizza was petty oily. One slice is 4-5$, which is slightly on the expensive side but not out of common for NYC.Would eat here again if I am in the area. But I have had some better New York style pizza in the City !"
29-Oct-19,"I love joes! Classic New York slice, good price, plenty of spots around the city!I'm a classic gal, so my favorite is the plain cheese, but I have tried the fresh mozzarella slice as well. Crust is perfect thin and crispy, nice balance of sauce to cheese. If you're looking for a great slice in NYC, Joe's will not disappoint!"
28-Oct-19,Joe's Pizza was a great introduction to New York at an authentic staple of Times Square!  I don't know if there's anything more quintessentially New York than having delicious slices of pizza at 1am!  The atmosphere is amazing and the line of late night snackers was perpetual. Eating at Joe's Pizza felt like being an extra in a Mart√≠n Scorsese film.
27-Oct-19,I must've come on the wrong night because I am completely and utterly shocked at the glowing reviews this place gets!!! Not nearly enough sauce or cheese & the cheese slices are as flavorless as pizza can get!
27-Oct-19,Classic New York pizza. Crispy and definitely delicious. A perfect stable in the city of New York. Got three different slices and enjoyed each one.
27-Oct-19,"My first fine to NY and this was my pizza slice experience! Let me tell you!!!! I was some happy camper. This pizza was so hot so fresh so goo! We came earlier in the day and literally went back to get more. It was nice and crispy on the bottom, soft and gooey on the top. With it being down the street from Times Square, be prepared for it to stay busy. Line out the door busy. However it moves really fast. I would definitely go back!"
27-Oct-19,"Very BAD service! Meh, pizza... so I went in to get couple of slices (1435 Broadway location) with toppings, I asked the guy how much they were, he rolled his eyes with an 'attitude' telling me how much they were $4.75 each. Since it was pouring outside I asked for pizza box & he said they don't give it out unless you get 4 slices. What kind of place is this? It's a tourist trap where they overcharge for their 'mediocre' pizzas for unsuspecting tourists from out of town. This is what I hate about NYC, bad food with a bad service. Go around the corner on 40th street ""Dollar"" pizza place where you get better service and cheaper better pizza."
26-Oct-19,One of the best pizzas I've had hands-down! Passed by this place probably hundreds of time and never knew until a friend recommended it.There was a line and I was told that there is always a line but it moved fast. The fresh tomato and mozzarella was simply amazing! The meat slice was a bit salty but still good. Prices were a bit higher but each slice was large. Worth every penny!
26-Oct-19,Very good! I tried the cheese and ten spinach pizza slices. Busy and small pizzeria. The line moves quickly but I was able to grab a seat and scarf down my slices. I usually only get cheese but the spinach slice was there at the counter so I figured I should try it! Service was good and friendly.
26-Oct-19,"If you like thin crust pizza, this is for you! Perfectly flaky and crispy. Line goes out the door, but you'll be inside ordering in less than 10 minutes.I ordered the White, Spinach, and Sicilian. My favorite was the Spinach. The Sicilian had red sauce that I wasn't used too (too much tomato to me).A must-try if you're in the area !"
26-Oct-19,"I just had dinner here two weeks ago with my tween daughter and it was the best $10 dinner ever! We were about to catch a Broadway show and needed a quick spot to eat. Joe's fit the bill! The line was long and when I stood at the end of the line, I was close to the door. The menu is fairly straight forward, and you can easily read it as you wait to place your order by the slice. While I waited in line, I directed my daughter to grab two water bottles from the fridge to wait with me in line, and then we told them we wanted 1 slice of cheese and 1 slice of white pizza and paid at the very end of the line.  I spent less than 5 minutes on the ordering process from beginning to end. Seating is typical New York- it's first come, first served barstool seating at pub tables and bar tables along the store front window. It was crowded, but my daughter and I had no problem grabbing seats from patrons that were finishing their dinner and leaving. The pizza was piping hot and the crust was thin and tasty! Will definitely come back!"
24-Oct-19,"Great location by Times Square. It's pretty good pizza, decent price. Not the best but not the worst. 4 stars for great location and great flavor. Would def go again if by time square. The line is long but it moves really fast!"
23-Oct-19,Coming back from the theater last Thursday night it's late but you can always use a slice. I'm a native New Yorker so trust me and I hate when people say that that this is true New York City pizza! Joses been serving pizza for a lot of years they got the thin crust they got the right cheese to sauce ratio and when they make a Sicilian slice it's as big as you needed to be with plenty of flavor. These pizza shops are scattered across the city while I was walking around New York I sampled several locations. When you walk in you got seating all around no problem get online the staff is fast the pizza comes back hot and you can't leave with just one slice. Pick your flavors pick your toppings they got it all. Bring your friends it's wrong New York City pizza!
23-Oct-19,"Delicious pizza! The pizza comes out piping hot. You can tell this place is popular because the line goes out the door. It goes by fast though, and it's definitely worth the wait."
22-Oct-19,Delicious pizza for only $1 per slice for cheese pizza and you add on top h toppings cost $0.50 more. And for $2.75 you got two slices of cheese pizza with one soft drink. They are delicious but they not the best pizza and you can get in the area since you get what you pay for. To some people they are oily so that doesn't look appealing much.
22-Oct-19,"Joe's Pizza puts Chicago Deep Dish to shame! My girlfriend and I stopped by Joe's after an intense day at New York Comic-Con, and we were blown away by the pizza. The location is a bit small, so seating is limited. We came around 10 pm, and it was packed! We saw a lot of the cool memorabilia inside, and a lot of famous people have visited Joe's Pizza, it was even featured in the original Spiderman movie. I ordered the Sicilian, while my girlfriend ordered the Supreme. Prices are pretty reasonable for NYC because it ranges from $3-$5 a slice, and the slices are huge! The Sicilian is not your average pizza slice, and it is rectangular shaped and super cheesy! The cheese melts in your mouth. However, the Supreme was king for us because it was a huge slice and came with a generous portion of pepperoni and mushroom. Definitely get the Supreme when coming to Joe's for that classic pizza experience. When we come back to NYC, we will make Joe's Pizza our first stop!"
21-Oct-19,"Once you take your first bite of the slice you get a full understanding of why there is always a line (don't worry it goes very quickly). I had a margarita slice and my only regret was not getting two slices lol by the time I finished I kept debating on whether or not to get another one but I didn't want to be late for my show (I'm a slow eater). This will definitely be on my list of pizza spots in NYC near Times Square area. My only complaint is that people need to learn how to pick up their trash after themselves, like how hard is it to throw away your plate and soda you were having. It's a busy place so help the staff out with that simple task."
21-Oct-19,"An NYC staple and voted best pizza in NYC numerous times.  The wife and I came in with our daughter on our last trip to NYC. Plenty of slice options, line can get long but like any good NY institution they have a great system in place and the line moves very quick!  Fresh pies are always on their way out of the oven as you wait.  We had one cheese slice, one white slice and a sicilian.  Every single one of them was outrageous and I debated getting back in line for more!  There are plenty of pizza places on every block of NYC but only some are true quality NY pizza like Joes.  Keep up the great work and reputation, we'll certainly be back for more next time!"
21-Oct-19,"Joe's is the definition of NY pizza, crispy thin crust with the perfect amount of cheese and toppings. NY pizza is best enjoyed folded in half :)We ordered the mushroom, supreme, and white pizza. Enjoyed all 3 after walking around Time's Square. This location is open til 2:30am, great place to grab a late night slice of pie."
20-Oct-19,"Best pizza in NYC! I heard about this place before and I decided to try it. Try the plain cheese pizza, it can go wrong."
20-Oct-19,Amazing pizza! Loved the breaded eggplant topping! The building was so unique too- it used to be a church!
19-Oct-19,"Wow! Talk about good pizza! Joe's hit the spot (twice) with their authentic NYC pizza. The crust was done to perfection and the flavors were delicious. The caprese pizza was my personal favorite as it was loaded with fresh tomatoes and basil. We walked right in on our first visit on a Wednesday evening but had to stand in line a bit on our second visit, which was well worth it. If there's a line, just keep waiting, it'll be worth your time! It's entertaining to watch the guys behind the counter as they prepare pizza at a pace that's pretty amazing. Definitely an art form! So glad we got to enjoy authentic, delicious NYC pizza on our visit."
19-Oct-19,"Absolutely delicious!  The family and I were visiting Manhattan for the first time and made it a priority to try some NY-style pizza.  Joe's did not disappoint!  Order timed a slice of pepperoni and a slice of mushroom, sausage and onion.  Both came piping hot and delicious with a smokey, wood-fired crispy crust.  We'll certainly be back!"
17-Oct-19,"Joes pizza has bomb pizza! The pizza is really good which kept me going back. I usually go with my husband but last night took a friend who's visiting from out of town. As we sat at the counter top inside, a couple of  perv little cooks came out multiple times and just stared at me weird with googly eyes. Heads up to Joes Pizza kitchen staff, people go there to eat pizza! Not be creeped out by a bunch of weirdos standing in the middle of the restaurant looking at you like you're a piece of meat! I'd say to the ladies, avoid this place if you're trying to avoid a rapey vibe."
17-Oct-19,"Joe's Pizza is about as NYC as it gets, and for that you should definitely make it a stop.  We wanted to go to the original on Carmine street but were in Times Square and it was getting late so opted for this location.We went for a regular cheese slice which was piping hot and absolutely delicious.  While you can throw a rock in NYC and find good pizza, Joe's reputation precedes itself for being one of the top spots and for good reason, the pizza is absolutely delicious.Note that it's definitely not a dollar-slice joint and you'll definitely want to keep in mind that slices are between $3-$5 but absolutely worth it.  If I had more time, I definitely would've tried the Sicilian, Fresh Mozzarella and White slices.  They looked absolutely delicious and will be my next move when I'm back."
17-Oct-19,"A go-to if you're in NYC and looking for pizza! There is always a line out the door, but it's very worth every minute. Highly recommend the sausage and pepperoni pizza!"
15-Oct-19,If you are ever in CALIFORNIA go to Toppers Pizza. Joes pizza hit the nail on the head.  It wasn't the best pizza but it is the best pizza in Times Square after 10pm.
15-Oct-19,"I heard a lot about NYC's thin crust pizza and Joe's Pizza.  Finally had one with mozzarella.   Was not impressed at all.  Thin layer of tomato sauce, sweet enough to make me think I was eating a danish. Will probably get a lot of grief over this but do not know what is the big deal over Joe's pizza.  Having only had one NYC  pizza , I will reserve judgement on NYC pizza in general."
9-Oct-19,Joes pizza is really as good as it gets. I love their slices. It's the perfect NY slice.
9-Oct-19,"Very busy pizza place located by times square. Had to drop by and try a slice of pizza; ordered a pepperoni pizza and it was huge. It's $5 for a slice so it was not bad. Pizza was really fresh and piping hot. Crust was nice and crunchy. I'm not the biggest fan of pizza, but this pizza was pretty good. However there is barely any seating which was not great because I don't enjoy eating things on the go. Lots of tourists as well so it got quite loud inside."
8-Oct-19,"Hard to beat this place for pizza.  It is 100% New York.  Recommendation...don't get too fancy with the selection.  Stay with the cheese, margarita or pepperoni.  Also, the lines can be a bit long, and New Yorkers don't appreciate people who cut in line.  A fight almost broke out in front of me as additional family members showed up with someone else.  ""F"" bombs were flying.Anyhow, highly recommend.  Great place!"
7-Oct-19,"I'm a huge fan of another pizza place in the area, but they don't deliver and we wanted delivery this night. Joe's wasn't nearly as good but still pretty great. If you are looking for a good delivery option of NY Style pizza, give Joe's Pizza a try!"
7-Oct-19,"The pizza crust is always burnt!!! Its the worst pizza in New York. Your better off going to the 99 cent pizza spot around the corner. I work across the street and the tourists that come to time square flock to this place because they don't know any better. It bothers me that they walk away with the misconception that this is  the taste of New York pizza ... I Recommend Margheritas Pizza 163-04 Jamaica Avenue.Jamaica Queens NY No toppings needed, Excellent NY pizza!!"
7-Oct-19,Unfortunately to me this place is a clear tourist trap. I waited in a long line to get a slice here and it clearly did not live up to my high expectations. The pizza was super oily and droopy. I understand pizza is going to be oily but there has to be a line drawn when the oil seeps through the plate and a handful of napkins. Also seeing streams of oil flow down when you pick the slice up....is a no no for me. Save your time and go to a less touristy establishment.
5-Oct-19,"As a New York native, I rarely ever find myself in the Times Square area. However, I've been going there a lot in the last few weeks for Broadway shows and late night show tapings, so I'm incredibly thankful to have this Joe's Pizza in walking distance for a cheap, delicious, and reliable meal. A slice of pepperoni will set you back $4, but it's better than anything else you'll find around Times Square. It's the perfect snack for when you get out of a two hour show nearby. There's usually a wait here, but the pizza is always fresh and comes out hot, so I consider that a win."
4-Oct-19,"Best pizza in New York!!!! Can't imagine New York pizza without THIS PLACE!!!!!! The dough is thin and chewy, so fresh and it tastes amazing!!!! It's literally the best pizza in town!!!"
4-Oct-19,"After watching Barstool review this iconic NYC spot, I decided to try it one night. It was extremely straightforward with waiting in line to picking your slice, they throw in the oven to heat up and by the time you pay it's already ready. Highly suggest the cheese pizza and the pepperoni! Make sure you stop by if your visiting NYC, they have four locations."
3-Oct-19,"Very good pizza! And although there was a line out the door when we got there, it moved quickly. When we're in New York City again, we'll definitely come here. Two slices next time!"
3-Oct-19,"Finally, out of all the times I've been in NYC, I get to try one of the places that sell NY Pizza. I wanted to see what all the hype is about. During my stay, I went here twice. First time was near closing time, which wasn't busy as much as during lunch time. FYI, if you go during busy hours, the line can go all the way outside. So, make sure you're not super hungry!I tried the cheese, and caprese. Something so simple makes it so good. Thin crust, nice sauce, not too much cheese. It just seemed well-balanced.I would highly recommend and for tourists to try to get a New York feel. Having this restaurant located in Time Square, parking it very difficult!"
2-Oct-19,"Good quick bite. Nice size slices. Not the best pizza I had in NYC, but definitely above average. Long line because of the location."
1-Oct-19,Very pricey slices. $4 for a pepperoni slice and $3 for a regular cheese slice. Absolutely delicious! There's always a huge line outside the doors of any Joe's Pizza. Great place for a quick bite. Or order for a party!
1-Oct-19,"My husband said, have to have pizza in NYC! Ok way better than Chicago style! Thin crispy and the little bit of burnt crust is AMAZING!! Had the true New York experience tonight"
30-Sep-19,"This place is amongst my favorite pizza spots in NYC. It's an awesome and affordable spot for late night pizza. I came around 9pm on a busy night and although the line was long and out the door, it moves fast!Each slice of pizza is somewhere from $3-$5, which is pretty cheap. For a couple of bucks, you're getting a great quality slice of pizza. The slices are a pretty good size too! My favorite was definitely the supreme. The restaurant itself is pretty cramped. There are a good amount of tables but there's just too many people either waiting in line or waiting for tables to guarantee you having a table to eat at, so do not plan on dining here. Overall, really solid spot for pizza in New York. I wouldn't say its NYC's best as some people say, but its very good."
29-Sep-19,"Good New York style pizza.  Being from Chicago, my standards are pretty high but Joe's lives up to its reputation. Reasonably priced and fresh ingredients. Line was out the door but man these guys move quick. In and out in 20 minutes. Had the white spinach and tried the cheese. Definitely be back. Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand!"
29-Sep-19,Heard the hype about this place and decided to give it a try. Got a plain slice. Crunch was good but cheese and taste was just OK. Maybe we had just got a bad slice?
27-Sep-19,"Joe's Pizza is the best pizza I have ever had in my entire life. they're so thing and crispy and flavorful. My first time eating it was in march and my second time having it was in July and I was thinking to myself that it cannot be still as good, but first bite and BOOM it was just as good. I love Joe's Pizza"
27-Sep-19,"Yup this is the famous Joe's Pizza. My favorite is the ""fresh mozz"" slice for $3-4. Sprinkle some garlic salt and chili flakes and I am so in heaven. I think this business is cash only so come prepared. To me, this is classic NY pizza: chewy crust, tasty tomato sauce, cheesy... just perfection you can't get in any other city."
26-Sep-19,"this is one of the best pizzas i have ever tried. theres always a line but it goes by fast and somebody will hold their table for you if you ask. the cheese slice and the pepperoni, AMAZING."
26-Sep-19,"joe's pizza is super yummy. their slices are so good and crunchy and really hit the spot when you're hungry. i came here with my dad and he loved it too. i think my favorite slices we got were the pepperoni and the slice that has sausage, onions, and pepperoni. there isn't much room to sit so keep that in mind- but it's definitely worth a try!"
26-Sep-19,"We are from out of town, and after a busy day, we just wanted to order pizza to our hotel. We found Joe's on Grubhub and the ratings looked great, so we ordered a pizza and Coke. It was delivered to the lobby of our hotel, fresh and hot. Now I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza (NY pizza) and not a fan of super thick crust pizza (Chicago). I like it right in the middle. If you're like me, know that Joe's pizza is DEFINITELY a true NY pizza. Super huge pieces that are almost paper thin.  They only offer one size, and there are 8 giant slices inside. The thinness probably necessitates the huge slices.I will also mention that they had salads on their menu, but I didn't see any type of breadsticks. I love breadsticks! ;)Either way, the pizza was good enough and we have full bellies. Pizza was super fresh and hot."
26-Sep-19,"Loved my trip to joes pizza! It was a little bit out of my way, but I was willing to check it out and see if it can live up to the hype and I wasn't disappointed. The place itself is not big and is probably the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars. I personally feel like they should expand this place because the line gets crazy long! However, it does move fairly fast. They have a few seats here and there, but they're usually full due to the small capacity. They also have a bunch of pics on the wall of different celebrities who have passed by and grabbed a slice.  The pizza itself was delicious and very cheap compared to other places in NY (especially in broadway.) however, it wasn't the best slice of pizza that I have ever eaten, but it is very Italian authentic. Needless to say, I will definitely come back here and probably order a whole pie for my family and I next time I go to the big apple."
25-Sep-19,"Joe's pizza is worth the hype! The service is fast and prices are reasonable ($3 for a slice of cheese). I came here at like 1am pretty much every day I was in NY lol, easy and delicious!"
25-Sep-19,"Really tasty. Super pizza, fast staff. We really liked pizza with tomatoes and mozarella."
25-Sep-19,"I've had Joes Pizza in NY and I've had Joes Pizza in LA. It's basically the exact same thing-delicious. I only get the bbq chicken pizza, it's the best one I've ever had anywhere. Nothing compares."
24-Sep-19,"This branch is now lousy...bad crusts bad over cooked pizza. I realize that it's busy, but this no longer tastes good. There's no ice, no fountain drinks any more..only warm bottles of soda. Dry pizza long waits..go to bleaker or 14th street for the real deal, this stuff....not so muck.am almost dominoes like quality."
23-Sep-19,"Okay, I'm sorry. I do not understand the hype with this place. I go to New York almost primarily FOR THE PIZZA. Like it's really the best pizza in the country in my opinion. I recently visited again, and had a couple of people tell me to go to Joe's. It turned out this location was near where I was staying so I went, all excited. The line was insane, so I thought, obviously it will be worth it.I finally get to the front of the line and look at the pizza, and to look at, it really didn't look exciting. The pepperonis weren't even thick or curly! Like what the heck! It looked like basic pizza. So I forewent pepperoni and got the fresh mozzarella one. I kid you not. I've had pizza before that maybe was too greasy, or too doughy or whatnot. I have NEVER IN MY LIFE had FLAVORLESS PIZZA. It was shockingly flavorless and boring. It was seriously such a bummer after getting so excited about it. If I wasn't in New York I wouldn't care that much. But I visit New York for the amazing food, and this was a huge letdown. Maybe this location's not as good because it's a tourist trap in Times Square. Maybe it's my bad for not going to a different location. Who knows. But I do not recommend. I don't understand the hype. Wish I did!"
23-Sep-19,"This was our first stop in New York. So hyped up, we were recommended in LA, Cali to come try this pizza place. The line was out the door, but it moved quickly because the pizzas were ready to serve and then reheat it again before paying. Their timing is incredible. They keep the line moving consistently and pizzas are all baked on time. Only thing they need to change is their interior. Needs a bit renovation!"
23-Sep-19,"Had to come to Joe's since it had been nearly an entire day on this particular trip and I hadn't had pizza yet. Seriously, you should never go a day in the city without getting some pie.Ordered what I did the first time I ever visited Joe's, one white and one supreme. Still falls under the solid, not spectacular category. Seriously can't go wrong with a slice at Joe's, especially if you want something quick and tasty!Service here is tremendous. I came here almost at midnight and the line was straight up out the door. But they move FAST. I got in line and I had my pizza in less than 15 minutes. They know people want their pie and they do not mess around.Like I said, if you want some quick and tasty pizza, come to Joe's. If you want mindblowing pizza, Joe's is not the answer. But it always gets the job done!"
22-Sep-19,"No words at all to describe this pizza!!! I was not expecting all what it really is! If you're in Manhattan, you HAVE TO stop by! Nothing to do with Spider-Man either!"
21-Sep-19,"The line was so long however the pizza was just okay. The crust is nice and thin, but the cheese pizza is a bit bland. Dissapointed as I heard many good things about this place. There are other less known places in NY where I have had better slices."
20-Sep-19,One of our favorite pizza places. Literally every time I'm on an Amtrak back home that stops at penn station I bring a box back on the train with me. That much better than the pizza in pa lol
20-Sep-19,Literally amazing.  So good I ate burnt pieces of crust and flight every temptation to re-enter the line for 2 more pieces.
20-Sep-19,"Expect a line but goes by pretty fast (the team here has a great system of expediting, heating the pizza and taking your payment). Pizza is about $4 a slice. Pizza was delicious! Wish I could've tried more but there is a variety of vegetarian options (mozzarella/basil, cheese, white cheese, spinach even I think). I got the meat combo one and tried a bite of the white cheese one. Both were good. Thin crust.Table space is limited but people come and go pretty fast. We got a high top table outside to eat off of. Seasonings on table include garlic and chili pepper."
20-Sep-19,"I moved from NYC in 2008 and have spent most of that time longing for a slice. It was worth the wait. Even when you have to eat standing on the sidewalk, Joe's is the best pizza ever!"
19-Sep-19,"Best slice of pie I've had in North America! Seriously delicious pizza at a must-go tourist attraction!! FOOD // I've tried the Cheese, Pepperoni, and Supreme slices. I highly recommend the Cheese, Supreme, then Pepperoni (in this order)! I'm not usually one to get cheese, but the cheese here is a CLASSIC and I have no complaints. The sauce is delicious and subtly flavourful, the cheese is yummy, and the slice is perfectly thin. I love that the Supreme slice has pepperoni, mushrooms, and onions, and is so packed in flavour! The Supreme is a different type of delicious from the Cheese slice as there is this burst of different flavours in your mouth. I would also recommend a glass bottle of Coke as the perfect pair with your NYC pie.SERVICE // I got here after watching a show and after Top of the Rock (I came here two nights in a row) around 10-11PM. There is always a line here, but it moves very quickly and I ended up waiting 15 min for both nights on the weekend I came. The servers are quick and friendly. ATMOSPHERE // It's a small-ish diner, but enough to seat quite a few people. I wouldn't recommend eating here as it gets pretty crowded and dirty. I get my pizza to-go, but there are also options to eat at the seating area outside! PRICE // It's ~ $8 for two slices of pizza - It's worth the size of the slice and flavour! I would pay this again for Joe's Pizza!!!Verdict: Joe, you make some good 'za."
17-Sep-19,"Ate 2 slices here, Sicilian and Pepperoni, and both were great, didn't have to wait at all, just walked up and ordered.  This was around 11:30am on a Saturday.  Joe's has been on all kinds of 10 best pizza lists and it deserves to be, it's the quintessential New York slice."
13-Sep-19,"Cheese slice for $3.00? Yes please!!!In a land where once only the most sophisticated American were able to graze and say with pride, ""I am a New Yorker,"" only few of our foremost landmarks that made this city what it is still stand today.Look around you. You will a handful of cheap and rundown fast fashion clothing stores, with the ever increasing costs of rent steering away the creativity of small businesses that once occupied this city. Joe's Pizza is the one true pizzeria that hasn't had its reputation tainted or quality outsourced. Thin, crepe-like discs of dough are stretched, brushed ever so carefully with a sweet tangy house made tomato sauce, sprinkled with just the right amount of cheese. Not too light, but also not too heavy. If you aren't careful, it is easy to wolf down 4 slices in one sitting.On the walls, hang printouts of the ever so deified celebrities that we countlessly encounter, through TV, movies, instagram or wherever where you may be prodding. You may be able to recognize the blotchy, 2000's low pixel quality portraits of these figures that are Leonardo Dicaprio and Bradley Cooper, or you may not. But for what it's worth, just know this is a damn solid pizza joint."
12-Sep-19,"Busy little place, but efficient. I ordered a whole pie which took about 15 minutes and I watched how quickly they could get slices to people and get you on your way. Nice staff as well and decent selection. Not a lot of seating though, so get it to go and walk the block or so to Bryant Park to enjoy. The pizza itself was fantastic. Good thinn, crust, flavorful sauce, delicious toppings, and just the right amount of cheese (not too much or too little). Really enjoyed this pizza on our vacation."
12-Sep-19,"Like any pizza carry out in NYC, at 2 AM it tastes pretty darn good!  I will have to return during the day to give a more accurate review!  Lol!"
9-Sep-19,"Best pizza hands down in NY!! My bf wanted to come here because it was shown on Spider-Man. I don't really care for pizza but THIS. CHANGED. EVERYTHING. The pizza is on a whole other level. The crust is so thin, but the cheese was balanced perfectly. The supreme has sausage, pepperoni, onion, and mushroom, the right toppings!! Love that they are served per slice. We walked it home to our hotel and it still tasted bombdiggityyy!! We had it 2 times and I wish we had it more! I would go back to NY just for this pizza. I am drooling just thinking about it, ugh!! Don't be deceived by the line because it goes by fast.I'd bring back a whole pizza if I could. Sac, step up your game ????"
7-Sep-19,"Cozy small but very famous Pizza store. I walked by before noon and no line so I hopped in to give a try. Ordered the classic cheese slice at only 3$. Such price for Manhattan is great! Pizza tastes amazing, fresh mozzarella and not so sweet tomato base on the thin crust. After I left people began lining up,"
6-Sep-19,"Fresh but ok... and I believe it's due to the nature of the quick service that often midtown Manhattan demands. The typical pizza quick service setup with not much seating so if you're coming non-solo, something to keep in mind."
5-Sep-19,"It was late at night and we just finished walking around Times Square. We were starving and almost all food establishments were closed... but not Joe's. It was a relief that Joe's offers accessible, affordable, classic NY-style pizza to satisfy those late night cravings! My favorite is their margherita pizza with that crispy crust! Would definitely be back on my next NY trip."
4-Sep-19,Great pizza. I mean for being a walk up dollar slice chain its bleeping great.... and a must if you're here in NYC.Its traditional NYC pizza and some times the lines are long but they go quickly get slice you wont regret it
3-Sep-19,I love Joes Pizza!!!! Out of all the places I've ate in New York I always have to come to this place. It is super busy and there's always a line. But the line moves soooooo quickly. They do have a lot of options. So you're sure to find something you'll like!!! Seating sucks. But what do you expect. It's New York!!! But I love it. Plus it came out in the spider man movie so hip hop hooorayyyy
3-Sep-19,Line out the door!!! But moves quickly so don't be afraid or intimated.  Needed a late night fix and this was perfect! Couple of slices of Mozerella hit the spot and will definitely be back for more!! Love this place!
2-Sep-19,"There are very few things in NYC that I would consider a bargain. Pizza is one of them, and Joe's Pizza is one of the best! The pizza is incredibly balanced, perfect amount of sauce, cheese, baked to perfection. $3.00 a slice. This is what make NYC, NYC"
2-Sep-19,This is your typical pizza place you see in movies. The line was long but it moves very fast so don't worry about getting in.The pizza is really good!!! Not the best in NYC but a very typical and delicious NYC pizza. Very safe choice in the city. My husband already went twice in a day.
1-Sep-19,"With locations all over NYC, I would describe Joe's Pizza as a trusted go-to place to get a traditional slice of New York style pizza.  While it's not my #1 choice for pizza in NYC, there is no denying that they make a pretty damn good slice. I've personally had slices their pepperoni, cheese, and Sicilian and all of them are fabulous. The Times Square location usually has a pretty long line, but the staff moves very efficiently. All in all, to avoid stumbling into any lackluster NYC pizzerias (and trust me there's a lot of them), Joe's is your best bet."
1-Sep-19,"So damn delicious. Crispy crust, amazing flavor. Tried cheese, white, spinach, caprese."
30-Aug-19,"I had wanted to try this pizza because I saw it in the buzzfeed worth it series show. We ordered a cheese pie, which was $21.00, compared to 1 slice of cheese ($3.00).  The pizza itself was really hot and made fresh for us, but the pizza was a bit big for the box and one edge of the pizza got folded over a bit. Also, while we were eating, the cheese just fell off the the pizza. I don't know if that is because it was hot, but it just slid right off one we got a bite. Overall the pizza was really good, crust a bit hard, but had good flavor."
29-Aug-19,"Pretty average pizza. Both regular and white slice that I got were burnt. I'm guessing that's what they do, so the tourists think that they are getting crispy NYC style pizza. Overall the pizza is pretty average, and there are plenty of better pizza joints around. Even some 99c slices are better. Definitely a 3 star place. If anyone rates it any higher, they must be from out of town"
29-Aug-19,Pizza was was great. The crust was just how I like it. The slices were massive! This is a great place however it's a little busy and there may but be too many seats inside. It's also a little pricey but still a fair price.
25-Aug-19,If your in ny and want a really good slice of pizza for good price go to Joes famous pizza. The slices were great sizes and prices were reasonable. I got a cheese and white slice and both were very good and thin. Next time I'm in Times Square I will be going back to this spot. Be prepared to wait in line during the evening but the wait is worth it.
24-Aug-19,Visiting from Miami and stopped here while shopping. Amazing food!! I had pepperoni  and added oregano and red pepper flakes. Didn't even get to snap a pic. Fast service so don't let the line fool u. Wait it out. It'll be quick
24-Aug-19,We arrived late in New York City and were looking for a good pizza.  We found Joe's Pizza in Times Square.  Great thin crust pizza.  All of us went back for seconds.  Friendly staff.  Open 24 hours.  Will definitely go back again!
23-Aug-19,"Pizza was very thin and crunchy, large slices and very tasty! Just how I like it. There was a line but it moved quite fast and the pizza was delicious."
21-Aug-19,"PETER PARKER WORKED HERE..well not this location, but he DID work at a Joe's Pizza! Joined the line that was out the door, down a couple stores. As people passed us, they asked if this place was really good and joined the line. The more people you see in line, the more you want to get in line! The slices are huge and pretty cheap! The line moves pretty quickly, but there's definitely a fight for seats! Be considerate and give up your seats as soon as you're done!"
20-Aug-19,"Likes:- Service is efficient, the line moved quickly.- Pizza slices are heated before being served.Not a fan of:- This is a eat and go kind of place, so there were quite a bit of dirty napkins, food crumbs and spills on floors and tables.¬†- Cash only, but the good news is tax is included in the price.My¬†flight was delayed quite a bit and I ended up arriving at the hotel at 11pm, well past¬†dinner time. Since we had training early morning, my work friend and I decided to grab a quick but good bite. Joe's pizza fitted the bill. I was enticed by the vibrant colors of the caprese pizza ($4.75) from the display case, so I opted for that. There was a good amount of toppings and everything was so fresh. The exterior of the thin crust was crispy, yet soft in the center. The tomato sauce was balanced with a nice sweetness to it. I didn't plan on having a second slice since it was already midnight, but I couldn't resist trying their famous cheese pizza ($3). I did not regret my decision. The cheese was rich, milky and creamy. Paired with the delicious tomato sauce, the flavours were perfect. However, the cheese pizza was slightly soggy in the center, which may be due to the faster turnover compared to the caprese slice I tried. The best part is I didn't get that gross greasy feeling after the meal and I didn't feel thirsty. It shows that this place uses good ingredients and are passionate about delivering an awesome slice to customers.This is a solid pizza joint and I would definitely return the next time I visit!"
19-Aug-19,Thin slices with great bread to sauce to cheese ratio. This is called NY pizza. Great pizza at great prices. People are nice too. Will come back for sure.
19-Aug-19,"My friend and I stumbled upon Joe's because we saw a huge line outside. Maybe it's because it was late and we were hungry or because we had walked 25,000 steps that day but that was the BEST SLICE OF PIZZA I'VE EVER HAD. There's only a handful of toppings to choose from and the ordering process is really basic but you really can't go wrong with what you order. Slices are HUGE and worth the money / wait. This location is super close to Times Square too which is convenient if you want to grab and go.As someone who has a 10 step skin care routine and tries her best to avoid anything oily...I'd smother my face in another slice of Joe's Pizza again if I could right now."
18-Aug-19,Some of the best pizza I've had in a while the pepperoni pizza is off the Sauces bomb there's just a long ass line other than that worth it I heard the vegetarian pizza is good to
18-Aug-19,Visiting NY from California and had to introduce my wife to real pizza (California pizza just doesn't compare).  The pizza was amazing and they delivered fast to our hotel!  Would definitely order from here again!
17-Aug-19,"The most iconic New York food is probably pizza. And for the true New York pizza experience, I think you have to go to Joe's. This is exactly what you imagine a New York pizzeria to be, whether it's from the movies and television to what your friends from New York have told you. This place is quick and simple: you come in, you order what you want, they give you the food, you eat it. It's not that complicated. Don't spend too much time thinking about it and poring over the menu options (there are that many) because time spent thinking will take away from time eating pizza. And the pizza here is definitely worth eating. Thin crust, not too hard, not too soft, with a perfect mix of sauce and cheese. The sauce is not too sweet, the cheese is just right. While you eat your pizza you can watch all the other customers and try to decide if they are tourists or real New Yorkers. You can also spend your time looking at all the pictures on the wall, trying to name all the celebrities that have visited Joe's. Like I said, a true New York experience. If you want to say you had New York pizza, you can definitely say it after you've been to Joe's."
17-Aug-19,"Crazily good but tough to get a place to sit and eat your food but I get it, it's NY eat on the run.Reasonable priced for NY.Don't pass up the opportunity."
16-Aug-19,"My first stop after landing in New York was to try Joe's Pizza. My friend and I came on a Friday night around 9pm and there was a super long line as expected, especially since it's right in Time Square. It did not intimidate us because the line moves fast. We ordered three slices to share: Mozzarella, Caprese, and Supreme (FAVE). I'm not usually too crazy about pizza but I was extremely hungry so every piece tasted amazing. I love the thin slices and the crispiness of the crust and the cheese is beyond cheeeeessy. UGH food porn!? If you're a tourist (or a local) and a fan of Spiderman, you have to make a trip to Joe's Pizza. No disappointments here!"
16-Aug-19,Pizza was delicious!  Guys behind the counter were polite and efficient.  Had to wait about 10 min in line on a Friday night at 7pm.  Very crowded inside with not many places to sit so I took mine to go.
15-Aug-19,"This is a very good slice. The place draws a crowd and it's no secret. Might even be viewed by some as a tourist trap so close to Times Square. Finding a place to stand can be a challenge and it can be messy, but if you want a good slice, walk past the other places and head here."
14-Aug-19,"There was a line. Came here cause Buzzfeeds. Pizza was amazing. $4 for one slice, 28 for entire pie. It's pretty good. Nothing amazing though."
13-Aug-19,"I had to see what all the hype was about and was not impressed.  After waiting in a long line, I got a slice of Pepperoni and a slice of Cheese.  The Cheese was good but not impressive.  It had that great thin crust I wanted and the sauce was good.  The sauce overpowering with flavor but perfect for the thin crust.  The Pepperoni was much better than the cheese.  The actual pepperoni was flavorful and went well with the sauce.  Very basic but good.The price for a slice of pizza was $3 or $4.  Not bad a big slice of pizza.  The inside of the place was very crammed but it was great to see tons of photos of celebrities that ate at Joe's."
12-Aug-19,"Simply the best pizza I have ever had! New York style pizza at its best. Thin crust, great sauce and seasoning and the best cheese. Delicious! Get on line and be patient- it's worth the short wait."
12-Aug-19,"This is that pizza joint you go to for that classic NYC pizza stop you see in movies and shows. But there will be a line so be prepared to wait! We came on a Monday afternoon and there was still a line. If you're looking to find a spot to sit inside - good luck, it's like vultures trying to find food inside. We ordered three different kinds of pizzas (just so we could try everything). The crust is crunchy while still soft on the inside. The pizza isn't piled annoyingly high or sloppy so in just one bite you get so much flavor along with fresh ingredients. The slices are huge but if you're really hungry I'd recommend a second for the road. We paid $18 for 3 slices of pizza and 2 drinks. Awesome price for being right in Times Square. Come here if you want some authentic pizza and want to give your wallet a break!"
11-Aug-19,Pizza was so good! The line seems long but it did move pretty fast and was worth waiting for. Will definitely return for there for more pizza when I'm in  NY.
9-Aug-19,"Worth the wait! We came twice on our trip to NY because I really enjoyed it. Joe's was nearby the hotel we were staying at and every time we walked by there was a line. Don't be afraid, the line actually moves pretty fast! Both times we waited around 20 minutes. Joe's was my favorite pizza in NY after trying a few places. I love how thin and crispy it is. We tried pepperoni, white, supreme and sausage/meatball? My favorite was the pepperoni, simple and delicious. Slices cost about $4, if you're not too hungry 1 slice will fill you up."
9-Aug-19,"We did a Yelp search for ""Best Pizza in Area,"" Joe's came up with high reviews...tried it and we weren't disappointed!  We had delicious slices of NY style regular and pepperoni. Line moved very fast and smoothly. Hot pies were coming out of the ovens quickly."
7-Aug-19,This place was exactly what we were looking for at 1:00am on a Sunday night after lots of beers and a Yankee game!!  Not the best NY pizza but it is open late night.  The staff was quick and there was a decent selection of pies.
5-Aug-19,"My husband came in starving from a late flight . So yelp to the rescue to tell us what was open, I mean we're in a city that apparently never sleeps right! Well this spot was about a mile from us and when we walked in it didn't disappoint flavor and taste wise. It was really good and super fast service. The pizza wasn't greasy at all and the drinks aren't fountain drinks there the basic 20 oz sodas you buy from the store so no refills sadly. The seating area is super cramp and really not a lot of moving area."
5-Aug-19,"The best pizza we had while in NYC. There was a bit of a line, but it flowed well. Nothing fancy, just great taste in really big slices of pizza!"
5-Aug-19,"I got a slice of fresh mozz and the white slice of pizza. Personally the white slice  is the way to go! The line wasn't too long, yes it out out the door but it didn't take more than 15 minutes to get in and get out. It's a small restaurant so there probably won't be any seating in there unless you're lucky. But overall it was very good!"
5-Aug-19,"I have been in NY twice over the past few weeks and walked by Joe's several times while there. There was always a long line so we put off checking it out. On our last visit, we decided to wait to see if the pizza was really worth it.The good news is that the line moves fairly quickly. Between my husband and I, we ordered a slice of caprese, a slice of cheese, and a slice of pepperoni to go. My take on the caprese was that it was just ok - not much flavor and I've definitely had better. The plain cheese was MUCH better as was the pepperoni. Is it the best pizza I've ever had in NY? Not by a long shot. I would have rated them a 3 1/2 if I could."
5-Aug-19,It's good but felt like it's not that special.. tasted like any NYC  pizza.. The line was crazy but they're so fast.. don't afraid from the long line.
4-Aug-19,"We grabbed slices of cheese, pepperoni and caprese. We got their before the large lunch rush so only waited for about 5 minutes. This will not go over well with devotees but it reminded me of the pizza at Pizzeria Regina's in the North End. In fact, it reminded me so much of it, I wasn't sure what the hype was all about. Don't get me wrong. It is very good pizza, and I would go back. I just wouldn't wait in the ridiculously long lines for it."
4-Aug-19,"THE pizza in NYC, need I say more? Thin crust pizza with a variety of toppings, margherita and the supreme were amazing"
3-Aug-19,"Worth the wait the line was long but moved quickly!!! Right across the street from CVS, down the road from time square So many choice of pizza but limited drink selection- but what do expect it's a NY pizza at its best!!!"
3-Aug-19,"YAYYYYYYYY! The line moves fast, pizza is HOT, and the people in the area know that this place is quality. Delicious. I was looking for a good pizza place and walked past a place near my hotel that had bad reviews so I walked out lol. This place was not far but took forever to get there because we ended up walking through Times Square lol. Never walking through Times Square but definitely coming back to Joe's whenever I am in the city."
2-Aug-19,"We were hungry after seeing a play (""To Kill a Mockingbird"") so we looked on Yelp for nearby pizza places. Joe's was highly recommended so we walked a few blocks to this location. The long line was daunting, but we were assured by others ahead of us that it would move quickly--which it did. There were many interesting celebrity photos and testimonials to keep us entertained as we waited for our turn to try the famous pie. We got three slices--combo, fresh mozzarella, and pepperoni. THEY WERE DELICIOUS! The slices were quickly heated in s brick oven to be piping hot. The pizza slices and a bottle of water cost $17. Not bad. Next time I want to try their white cheese, regular cheese, and caprese pizza. There are several high tables and bars to eat in the restaurant. Or it's close enough to Times Square to eat while people watching. Many people said they were getting pizza to take back to their hotel. Great new favorite in NYC!Oh, and they're open until 3:30 a.m.  Wahoo!"
2-Aug-19,"Delicious NYC pizza! Thin crust, perfect amount of sauce and cheese.  Totally worth waiting for if there is a line."
1-Aug-19,"A staple near Times Square, whenever we visit NYC. I wouldn't call it the best pizza in NYC but it's damn close. The crust is perfect, the slice holds its shape and the first bite into the pizza just reminded me how much NYC pizza is ahead of anything you get in Dallas. We got 5 slices (cheese, pepperoni, Sicilian, fresh moz) and every one was great! The location is super busy and there's a line all the time. Seating is very limited...maybe 15 seats. Most people just stand outside and eat.I still prefer DiFara and some other NYC icons but Joe's location, price and quality cannot be beat."
1-Aug-19,Yum!! Great pizza so far it's been our favorite!! I had the pepperoni and was satisfied. My family enjoyed their pizza too. I'd be back if we visit NYC again.
1-Aug-19,Cheap and good ny style pizza. Would definitely recommend stopping by late night after you get the drunk munchies. There was a line around 1:30 am when we got there. But it moves fast
29-Jul-19,"Unlike any other New York slice I've had this trip, Joe's cheese slice was soft. The crust was light brown with scattered burnt bits. I think this is the definitive characteristic New York-style slice. It's gotta be a grab-n-go meal. You need to scarf down food fast while on the run, and honestly, I love it. Because the crust wasn't tough, the flavors of the tomato sauce and cheese oozed in and augmented the already flavorful dough.  The cheese was slightly chewy and very stretchy. As far as low moisture mozzarella pizzas, Joe's slice was maximized in flavor. However, the sauce was the dominant flavor of the pie. It was sweet and slightly sour. There were even little bits of tomato in this slice which was a pleasant surprise. There is a reason why people call Joe's the best in the city."
29-Jul-19,This is by far our favorite NY pizza! Perfect crispiness. The crust is perfect! The slices are huge. Definitely worth waiting in line for.
28-Jul-19,"Best pizza in the world. Delicious, and crispy.family year trip.We were so glad to found a wonderful, testy wonderful pizza.Prices are very affordable. Come visit guys"
27-Jul-19,"Ordered pepperoni pizza for delivery.Taste was great, the pizza was big, could easily be shared between 3-4 people. The promised delivery time was an hour, took around 30 minutes instead. Will definitively order from them again."
26-Jul-19,"Joes Pizza has everything you want in a New York Pizza spot. The Pizza is foldable and greasy, but not too much. The wings were crispy and the buffalo sauce had just the perfect amount of spice. The beer was cold, the mugs were frosted.Our waitress Sam was on top of it and made sure we lacked for nothing and had a great energy.Joe's is a definite stop anytime you need a pizza fix in the times squarea."
25-Jul-19,"Small place which is obvious as Manhattan is most expensive real estate. Lots of people and there was a line moving at a good pace.Grabbed a slice of cheese pizza for $3 cash. Hot good thin slice, definitely tasted different than other places.Would I go again? Yes why not. Is it the best cheese pizza slice? Nah I don't think so. If you are around, grab a slice. Who can say no to pizza."
25-Jul-19,"Definitely one of the best slice in NYC. I ordered one plain slice and it's simple yet delicious. It's not fancy but the food speaks for itself. The other selection of pizza looks good too. They have garlic powder, Parmesan cheese, red chili flakes and black pepper as condiments."
25-Jul-19,"Literally THE BEST pizza I tried here in New York. Out of all the pizza places my boyfriend and I tried on our trip, Joe's was our favorite. We ended up eating here 3 times in the 3 days we were there! The first time we went was during lunch and though the line was out the door, it goes by pretty fast so don't be discouraged! The last two times were after a night of drinking and we were looking to fulfill our munchie cravings. I've tried the Supreme, Cheese, and Fresh Mozzarella pizza and all were super delicious. I feel like I would definitely stick to just the plain old, traditional Cheese pizza. I love how big the slices of pizza are and how, despite the long length, the pizza can still hold its shape. The crust is the perfect amount of crunch and doesn't overpower the taste of the toppings, much like how a lot of other pizzas with thicker crusts can do.Highly recommend this place!! A bit steep for a slice of pizza (ranging from $3 - $4.50), but definitely worth every damn penny. Will DEFINITELY come back here whenever I am back in New York."
25-Jul-19,I wanted to experience New York pizza and when I walked by and saw a really long line I knew I had found it. The line moved really fast and it was worth the wait. This pizza was amazing.
24-Jul-19,"Solid, solid slice. Probably the best traditional cheese slice you can get in the city. The slice itself is pretty big. The sauce to cheese ratio is perfect. The tomato sauce has a subtle sweetness and a very fresh taste. The cheese is what makes the slice for me though. It's fresh, gooey, stringy, and tasty. Slices are thin, but not crazy thin. It doesn't have much crisp. The slices are cheap $4-5. The line is usually out the door, but moves swiftly."
23-Jul-19,Solid pizza. Tried almost all their slice options this trip. Pepperoni and white are best. Better than pizza I can get at home but probably not life changing.
23-Jul-19,Was hoping this place was going to be better but was a little disappointed on our visit. Both the margarita slice and white slice I got were over cooked so it was dry. Did not taste fresh. It was extremely hot outside and almost as hot inside. Small location which was way overcrowded.
23-Jul-19,Probably the best pizza in New York. Super fast service. We ordered 6 slices and took it outside to eat ! Felt so good to eat this in New York!
23-Jul-19,"Joe's Pizza was sooo good!! Due to its location in Times Square and popularity, be prepared for a line. However, the line moved very quickly and service was efficient. There is little seating inside but a lot of people just order pizza to go, so it's definitely possible to get a seat. The pizza itself was very good and inexpensive. I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for pizza in Times Square."
23-Jul-19,This was the best New York style pizza!!!! The price was right also less than $5 for a huge slice!!!
22-Jul-19,"When in NYC, it is a MUST to have a slice of pizza and it appears that Joe's Pizza is where the locals go.The line is usually out the door and there are a bunch of Joe's in town, and this one is the closest to Times Square.I went for a standard Pepperoni slice and a Diet Coke and it was very good. Unfortunately, the inside did not have any seating as it was small and crowded, so I enjoyed the slice like a true New Yorker and ate on a bench outside."
22-Jul-19,"I came here to try the iconic New York pizza and it exceeded my expectations. I got the supreme pizza, which was crispy but soft at the same time. The sauce to cheese ratio was amazing."
22-Jul-19,Possibly the best cheese slice I've had in nyc. Be ware of the long line however it does go pretty fast.
21-Jul-19,"Well I see many 4-5 star reviews but not that impressed but it was solid slice place.  I would go back if it was there and near by, but for sure I would go to Ray's Famous over this as a small chain in NYC vs. Joe's. But that said it is better than any $1 slice place and had the nice crust crunch, but not as much on the cheese and sauce, but 3+ for sure."
20-Jul-19,"If you are looking for high end fancy pizza, look elsewhere.But if you want solid NYCPizza delivery, I recommend Joe's. We ordered a whole meat lovers pie and it was delivered fast and hot! Crust is thin, sauce is tomatoey and they did t skimp on the meat.Only downside is limited options. You can't get get onions or olives. However, you can choose different toppings for each half of the pie which is nice if you have a non-meat water and just wants cheese."
19-Jul-19,First pizza in New York and it was amazing! Definitely will go back :) limited seating and line out the door but it went fast!
19-Jul-19,"Short sweet and to the point.We got Caprese, supreme and fresh mozz! So so so good!!  Fresh and delicious"
18-Jul-19,I was double charged through my credit card and also paid cash . Can I have my refund please through my credit card.  Overall pizza was good
18-Jul-19,"This may be more of a nuanced or critical review simply due to the fact that expectations run high for New York pizza in New York.  The pizza isn't bad, don't get me wrong, it's just not great.I ordered delivery via Yelp and though estimated delivery was nearly 90 minutes, the food arrived quickly and fresh.  Fair warning when ordering delivery, Joe's does not provide the option to order single slices.  I understand the need to accommodate owner cost, but placing a minimum delivery order should suffice.  Forcing patrons to order a full pie is honestly unfair and not a good business practice.  Once the food did arrive, the food was warm and seemed that delivery was very quick.  But the bites into the pizza just didn't have that New York pizza kick.  I don't know how to explain it, it wasn't bad, it was good pizza, but something seemed to be missing.  I wouldn't not go to this restaurant, but it wouldn't be my first choice when in New York."
17-Jul-19,"Very quick note - The Pizza was great, delivered fast.  Delivery guy was a nice guy.The weather was awful, so Joe's Pizza in the hotel room was fantastic!"
16-Jul-19,"Made a pit stop after seeing so many positive reviews, it was also my first ever taste of the NY pizza. Long line equals good food, right? But after ordering the caprese pie I was truly disappointed..+1 Star for how fresh and hot it was but -4 for all the toppings and cheese dripping like molten lava and coagulating on the bake sheet. We scooped up our toppings with the bread and ate away. Italia meets South Asia...On a side note, where the hell can one find a good cup of chai in NY?! I mean come on,man!!!"
16-Jul-19,Loved this pie!  I only wish I had stopped in at the beginning of my trip so I could have gone there every day!
15-Jul-19,"First stop on our trip to New York, and it didn't disappoint. Photos of celebrities decorate the wall as you wait to pick up your slice. The line winds out the door, and moves quickly. If you're lucky, you'll get a seat at a table or a standing room only spot at the bar. Many people take their slices out with them and walk around the city. Slices are all less than $5, and are pretty good sized. I got the fresh mozzarella and absolutely loved it. No complaints about this small pizza place!"
15-Jul-19,I can not believe how they got this much good review as really it was nothing to mention about their pizza and even the bread was burn! And just 5 kind of pizza base in the name but in reality just all are cheese and tomato and that's it
15-Jul-19,"While stopping in New York for a short amount of time with my family we knew that one thing we had to do was try some of the famous thin crust pizza. Lucky for us we passed by Joe's Pizza on the way to Times Square and with a long line out the door, we knew we found a good spot. There were so many people in the line that it looked quite intimidating but it does move quickly! Within a short amount of time, we found ourselves in the front and ready to order. They had so many different slices to choose from and all were in a very affordable range of $3-5. We ended up going with a couple of slices of cheese, pepperoni and the white pizza. All of the pizzas were delicious. The flavors were good, the crust was cooked perfectly and the toppings were yummy. With this type of value, you really can't complain! I would 100% come back here the next time I visit NYC."
14-Jul-19,"Everyone talks about New York pizza.  This place is by far the best pizza I had in new York.  The pizza is so light,and huge slices.  The line was long when I got in it but they move fast.  When I come back I will definitely visit this or one of there other locations.  I recommend this place to anyone who likes or wants to try NY pizza"
14-Jul-19,It was a long line and the pizza was ok at best. I be honest and say that I got the very last slice of a pizza so I do not know how long it was out. I would stop by again if I am in the area and try it to see that was the case.
14-Jul-19,"Definitely the best pizza by the slice place of those around Times Square. I went here twice (in two days) and got the cheese pizza. I will say the pizza has more flavor than you would think. Not much seating inside but they have a few benches outside. They also don't have a soda fountain, only fridges with beverages."
13-Jul-19,"Incredible pizza every time. I do prefer the Union Sq location to this location in terms of seating options and general business. The food is equally as good though, of course, it's Joe's. The Union Sq location seems to have a better handle on service speed and I've never had to wait in a super long line like I've had to do at the Bryant Park location, probably since it's so close to Times Square. Anyway, if you're a tourist looking for good N.Y. pizza, don't go to 2 Bros a few blocks away, ""splurge"" for Joe's."
13-Jul-19,"Great pizza, great service and great price - best slice we had in NYC! If there's a line  it's worth the wait!"
13-Jul-19,"All I can say is believe the hype. Joe's Pizza is really as good as everyone says it is. My family and I ordered a bunch of various slices and shared a few bites with each other. I tried the White, Pepperoni, and cheese slices. All I can tell you is that no matter what you end up getting you won't be disappointed. I loved the style, the taste, and just everything about it. It is a thin pizza but the crust has a nice chewy and gooey feeling that just makes it taste so good. The sauce and cheese are light and not overpowering. The various toppings are put in the perfect amount to make for the best pizza I have ever had.My family and I came on a Friday night and it was a decent-sized wait. We waited for about 20 minutes but it moved pretty quickly and was well worth it."
12-Jul-19,"Best pizza in town is all I can say. I like Williamsburg's store the best. Don't hesitate if you're around there, try it!"
12-Jul-19,"Small space and long lines, but totally worth it! Get the mozzarella slice. Don't expect to sit down inside, we just hung out on the sidewalk walk and ate...just as good"
11-Jul-19,Ordered and paid online and skipped the (long ass) line. Ordered a pepperoni and white with chopped garlic; DELICIOUS. Huge foldable NY style pizza.Go if you want to experience the real deal.Pizza didn't have a fighting chance to get it's picture snapped.
10-Jul-19,"Once again Yelp steered me in the right direction!  Wanted to find some good NY style pizza and ended up here.  The line was out the door which typically I would not wait in but then I could smell the pizza and knew I'd have to wait.  Thankfully the line went pretty quickly.  All the tables and benches inside were taken, but just as we got our pizza slices a table opened up.  This place is not big but it doesn't stop people from standing in line! The only problem with the quick turn around on tables and benches is they have no time to wipe them down between customers and it is a bit hard to get over eating at a dirty table.The walls are filled with framed pictures of celebrities that have been to Joe's which was fun to look at.I loved the thin crust.  Crunchy yet chewy!  The sauce was perfect...not too sweet and a bit tangy.  I like it so much we came back twice during our stay.  Both times I had cheese slices with slightly different cheeses each time.  Excellent!!"
10-Jul-19,"I'm a SoCal native who visited NYC over the previous weekend. This wasn't our first pizza stop, but it was our favorite. My sisters and I were excited to try white pizza, and this place didn't disappoint. They actually had our first choice available, unlike the place we went to the previous day. It may have been a combo of walking all day in the humidity and the flavor of the pizza, but It was so good that I already want more. The seating area is a bit small and the line looks long, but it moves fast. There's a reason this place is popular."
10-Jul-19,"I can see how this is the most recommended pizza of NY. The sauce is sweet and fresh, not astringent or tinny. The crust is thin and chewy but not so thin that it's cracker like. The cheese to sauce ratio is perfection! Honestly this is a pizza that is best plain without toppings. The toppings almost took away from the sauce flavor and distracted from the pure pizza itself. Definitely go at an off time to avoid the wait though. It's good but not good enough for a 30+ minute wait."
8-Jul-19,A very hyped pizza spot in Time Square. When I got here there was a line outside the door but it moved really fast. Service was quick and the workers were nice and efficient- like moved AND talked fast. The grease on the pizza was REALLY prominent. I used MULTIPLE pieces of napkins to dab off most of it. Pizza was thin and flavorful. I'm not sure what it was but there was a savory flavor that I hadn't experienced before that made the slice special. Wasn't a life changing experience but was a pretty dang good slice of pizza.
7-Jul-19,"Good pizza but it is not worthy waiting.   If this is the best pizza in NY, there are many better pizzas in other cities (Chicago, San Francisco).   The lower part of the pizza is burn and not too many cheese and pepperoni."
7-Jul-19,"Such good quality pizza for the prize!  Ordered a slice of classic and fresh mozzarella.  Fresh mozzarella is amazing, perfect balance of sour/sweet/salty taste and that charred flavor at the end!"
7-Jul-19,Honestly pizza had not been the same since I ate a slice from joes the last time I was in NYC. It's that good.
7-Jul-19,"They live up to their hype. There is a reason why they always have a line out the door. The pizza is simple yet delicious. Although there is always a line of people their service is super fast. The pepperoni pizza is my favorite, it's simple but flavorful. We visited this place many times during our one week stay and also ordered delivery on a night when we were exhausted from walking all day. The delivery was extremely fast and convenient. Joe's pizza is NY's best!"
6-Jul-19,"What an excellent pizza, delivered hot to my hotel in under thirty minutes. Great cheese, awesome sauce and a nicely toasted crust. Absolutely delicious. Thank you."
6-Jul-19,I LOVE Joe's pizza! Have made an effort to stop in every time I'm in NYC. Had a pizza delivered the last time I was in and was not disappointed. Would 10/10 recommend this place for anyone looking for an awesome NYC pizza!
6-Jul-19,"Solid pizza, but I don't get all the hype. I will try Bleaker street next time..."
6-Jul-19,"Don't worry about the long line, it's worth it and it moves fast. The pizza was good for our first try at New York pizza."
6-Jul-19,"Great slices (great cheese and crust) right near Times Square.  If you are with a large enough group, you can beat the lines and call ahead and order an entire pie (8 slices)."
6-Jul-19,Overrated NY style pizza.  We had IpizzaNY twice so we thought we would try something different on our last night being in NY.  Ugh instant regret.  I had the Sicilian which was a thick crust.  It was a little burnt and the sauce had no flavor.  My husband had pepperoni and one with Ricotta cheese and also said it was bland.
5-Jul-19,Classic NewYork pizza. Joe's lived up to the hype. Go here for ur pizza while in New York.
5-Jul-19,"I got 2 slices, one cheese and one Supreme. Surprisingly, was not greasy and defintely was fresh. Both were amazing and some of the best pizza ive ever had, and not to mention was defintely affordable. I was very impressed by this place and 100% wud go again."
4-Jul-19,"My friend and I ate here, and we really enjoyed it. It was busy, but we managed to snag a spot at the window. We both got a slice of cheese pizza for $3 per slice. I had heard that this was good pizza, but I hadn't had it before. It is a great price and great taste. It was hot, fresh, and filling. A few minutes after we sat down, the line got huge. I do not have any complaints- it was a great experience."
4-Jul-19,"This is your typical New York style pizza. The line was down the block, so my expectations were high. The toppings were greasy, but good. My main problem was the crust. I know brick oven pizza has some char spots, but the entire bottom of one of our pizza was completely burned. It kind of ruined the experience. Our second pizza was fine and did not have this problem."
3-Jul-19,Two stars for the quick delivery at 2 am. Pizza was just like any other normal pizza you can buy from the grocery freezer section .Everyone keeps raving about how pizza in new York is the best and blah blah but this one is a complete disaster. Especially with the extra cooked crust that's impossible to eat :/
3-Jul-19,"So far the best slice of pizza I've had in NYC. I'm not usually a big fan of NYC style pizza but Joe's takes it to a higher level. They chat the crust just enough to make it crispy and browned around the edges. Dough is soft yet firm enough to eat on the go if you have to. Sauce, cheese and toppings are all very good! Worth a look if you're in the area."
3-Jul-19,"A-OK. I rate this below Paulie Gee's, which is still the pizza to beat after ~2 weeks in NYC and ~5 slices of pie.+1 star for being really great value. For this price point, it's the best I've had so far.Not worth a special trip or a long wait, but a good choice if you're passing by and need a bite."
2-Jul-19,"I'm not a Pizza kinna girl, but how can you not get pizza when in NYC?! I gotta say this was probably one of THE BEST pizzas I've ever had. I'm STILL thinking about it!- FOOD: We got 4 SlicesSupreme (WOW Great)White w/ Mozzarella (Great)Spinach (Good)Caprese (Good)MOUTH freaking Watering! My favorites were the Supreme and the White Cheese pizza. The pizzas were thin, but huge slices. The flavors were very strong and paired so well with the crispy doughy crust and the sauces kept things moist without being soggy or dry. I honestly can't describe it as anything but a legitimate New York pizza. What more do you need or want (especially if you're not a pizza lover)?!- Price: Cheap Eats 100%...like you'll eat it and be like ""seriously how is this only this much?!""- Location: We went to the location on Broadway smack dab in Times Square. We got there a little after lunch but there was still a line outside but it moved FAST! By the time we got our food and was eating a whole new line had formed outside...but worth the wait!- Ambiance: The vibe is great inside. It's tiny and there's limited seating, but we were able to get a table for 3 of us to eat. It was like a typical pizza shop with all it's hustle and bustle. Lots of pictures of celebrities that have visited before!- Service: Everybody was nice, but of course they're fast. This isn't like back home in Houston where everybody stops what they're doing to have a conversation with you. They were working fast and efficiently back there though. - Cleanliness: Place was in great shape!Go check out the hype if you're a tourist. I'm sure the locals have many other spots, but I think it's a good starting point for a newbie! Next time I'm going to do a special order with my favorite toppings!"
2-Jul-19,"Tastes great!! Especially for the price. Personally didn't like the caprese and white pizza. Fresh mozzarella and cheese was the best! My family liked the supreme too. Highly recommend for people looking for classic everyday New York pizza. Cracker crust, dry bottom, and tasty sauce. Sauce is little on sweeter side though. Line can get long but pretty fast pace. Much faster to pay with cash. Loved it! Sorry- blurry pic is screenshot from sc video."
2-Jul-19,Absolutely the BEST slice of pizza!  There is always a line here no matter what time.  The service is quick though.  Totally worth the wait!  I could've eaten here all vacation.
2-Jul-19,"4.5 but it's a NY institution, so rounding up.Classic for a reason. One of the best, accessible pizza by the slice in downtown part of manhattan, with couple of outposts.Classic is fine, but fresh mozz is really where it's at."
2-Jul-19,Heard so much praise for this pizza place from people I know so I tried it out. I wasn't disappointed it was yummy and good size pizza
1-Jul-19,"Great authentic New York pizza with great, efficient & friendly service.  Great choices of different pizzas too.  Loved it."
1-Jul-19,"One of my all time favorite pie shops in NY! It's a must-have every time that I'm in the city. The service is always friendly and great. The slices are perfect from hot melted cheese to thin crust to toppings. Every bite has the perfect ratio of crust, sauce, cheese and toppings! I normally get a slice of pepperoni and a slice of fresh mozz. So. Damn. Yummy! Can't wait until my next trip back to NY!"
1-Jul-19,"Visiting from Chicago so our expectations were high! Joe's pizza was delicious. The perfect sauce, cheese, and dough ratio! Very impressed with speed of delivery. They also included many plates, napkins, red pepper, oregano, and garlic powder which came in handy staying in a hotel. Would recommend and order again!"
28-Jun-19,Classic NYC pizza. I don't think you can go wrong with Joe's. The lines get long but it's worth the wait. 4 slices and 2 drinks were a little over $20. The walls are adorned with celebrity photos who frequent Joe's. Nice snack while walking around and enjoying the city.
28-Jun-19,"Joe's was on our list for today after seeing how packed they were yesterday, however, after walking Round the city all day we just wanted s rest... sooo... DELIVERY!!  Ordered Supreme at 5:30, received an immediate text confirming delivery by 6:20.  When I called the front desk to give them a heads up at 5:45, the pizza had just come through the front door.  It was piping hot and DELISH!  Next time we'll brave the crowds and try some different toppings a slice at a time but definitely not regretting our choice today!!!"
27-Jun-19,Absolutely the BEST slice of pizza!  There is always a line here no matter what time.  The service is quick though.  Totally worth the wait...
27-Jun-19,10/10 best pizza in New York and quite possibly the world. My husband hasn't stopped talking about the greasy cheesy pie that we ordered while in New York. Love that they are open super late. I think the location we ordered from was open until 3:00am. We ordered one for delivery and it was well worth the price. You get a big ole pizza for about $20.Grab a slice if you're in the city and you won't regret it.
26-Jun-19,Looking for a good pizza place in New York. This one is definitely the way to go! So fresh and good. Definitely coming back next time I visit!
26-Jun-19,Delicious!  The epitome of a NY slice!  Do yourself a favor and go to Joe's!  You won't be disappointed!
25-Jun-19,great pizza! always worth the wait. it hits the spot when i need some good cheesy tomato goodness
25-Jun-19,I was not very satisfied with the delivery service. Forgot my water. The delivery guy who gave us the water second time was careless. And we gave him two piece of pizza for sending the water. He was cool to that. It was his job to send both the pizza and the water to us. He forgot the water. But did not realize his fault.
24-Jun-19,"Really excellent pizza. In my opinion, the quintessential NYC slice. Greasy, but it should be. Lines are long but move pretty quick. Best if you have cash going in here as the card machines really slow things down."
24-Jun-19,Classic NY style pizza. We were sober at 1:00am on a Sunday so taste buds were fully functioning. The right amount of crunch and pull in crust. The right amount of char on crust and the right level of sweetness in crust. I will find my way back here. Good use of carbs!
23-Jun-19,"First time I waited in line outside for pizza for 30 minutes, service was ok.  Pizza was great for times square.  I had tried a few places for slices and it was usually cold.  Here because it's always so busy new pizzas come and it's warm.While not the best, considering it's by times square, definitely the place I would go if I wanted pizza."
23-Jun-19,"One of the best pizzas I've ever had. I love how late Joe's pizza is open till for any late night munchies or for anyone that is jet lagged and craving a bite. It's thin and crispy, so it's not too heavy. I tried:- Supreme (MY FAV)- Special (white and spinach.. thought it was ok)- Pepperoni (ok)- Cheese (not bad) For my next visit, I'd def order 2-3 slices of the Supreme"
22-Jun-19,"Best pizza in New York!  The line can be a little long, but definitely worth the wait! When you want amazing New York pizza, this is the place to go!"
22-Jun-19,"We had joes after seeing a lady with their pizza box,  so we ordered two for the room , they were fast and it was delicious, I've had most pizza joints here, joes is up there"
21-Jun-19,"Came on friday for lunch and didnt expect the line to be out the door but it was moving pretty quick. Packed full of tourist and very nostalgic of an authentic nyc pizzeria. Grabbed myself a white slice and was thoroughly impressed. The service was quick from beginning to end. The crust was perfection - thin, got that crunch and crisp and the great amount of flour. The  cheese was rich, buttery and scrumptious. I may just start a weekly pizza lunch tour. Must try if you're in the neighborhood!"
20-Jun-19,"it was good, really thin, crispy pizza but it wasn't like wow its amazing."
20-Jun-19,"Fresh, hot, tastes great and to the point (no frills), came right before lunchtime for 0 lines!"
20-Jun-19,Amazing pizza! First time to NYC and had to see what the hype was all about. It was worth it and certainly lived up to it.
18-Jun-19,"Unreal! I'm a Chicagoan & have been everywhere around the world, VERY picky about my pies! While there is no better pie than CHI...I WAS ABSOLUTELY in Pie Paradise at JOES!Fantastic in every way!  Doesn't matter where you are from, CHI, NY, Italy or elsewhere; -----YA HAVE TO TRY JOES"
18-Jun-19,"Good pizza, not bad per se.  didn't have a lot of choices and the cost starts at $3/slice.  Moves fast, even if there is a line.  Some seating, not a ton.  Big slices at least; two will do you."
18-Jun-19,"Don't give up if you see the line. The line actually move very fast. If you are ordering a box, you can skip the line. Very thin pizza Good price Taste good Large slice The wait is reasonable"
18-Jun-19,"Joe's pizza was my first NY pizza and it was delicious! I got a pepperoni slice my first time and a margarita pizza the second time. The only reason I am giving this a 3 star rating is because the pizza was a bit chewier the second time I came back. My mouth was sore after I was done eating lol.I did like the pepperoni pizza more than the margarita pizza and if I'm ever back in Times Square I would come back here, despite the long line.Maybe the 3rd time's a charm and the pizza isn't chewy this time"
17-Jun-19,"We did some research looking for the best New York Style Pizza. Joe's was well recommended by locals and tourists alike. We ordered a classic pepperoni pie and a pepperoni, onion, sausage, and mushroom pie along with an individual salad. The salad was good, but the pizza, ah... the pizza. I'll be the first to admit I am no kind of educated person when it comes to New York Style pizza, but the pizza we had was TOP DRAWER. Don't hesitate to take the plunge and give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"
17-Jun-19,"Believe the hype. Hot, fresh, crisp and delish! The line was long but it moves quickly. Well worth the wait."
16-Jun-19,"Great New York style pizza! This location is pretty close to Broadway and Time Square, so it's convenient. But also be prepared for it to be crowded. Luckily, when we arrived a table was opening up so we didn't need to stand and eat. The employees are fast and very hard working. That long line moves extremely fast and you have your pizza slice within minutes. I got the pepperoni and white pizza slices. I liked the pepperoni the best. The white didn't have much flavor until I added the red pepper flakes. Although the cheese on top was great to dip my crust in. Slices are huge and they have plenty of ingredients on top to get flavor in every bite. Definitely a good stop to make for lunch to feel like a true New Yorker."
16-Jun-19,The cheese was ok and the sauce was fair for the NYC quest to find the best pizza in NYC.
15-Jun-19,"Great spot to take your friends when they're in town visiting and drag you to Times Square (also great in general). There's a line, but it moves quickly. The pizza was thin, crispy and warm so no complaints. There isn't many places to sit."
15-Jun-19,"I wasn't impressed... the pizza was warm-ish, not hot, and after all the food reviews I expected it to be phenomenal but it was just okay"
14-Jun-19,"Wow, landed at JFK at 12:30 am, by the team we had our bags, found our ride and arrived Manhattan, it was 2:00 am. We arrived on a 6 hour flight from LA, so we were hungry and on a mission to find an open NY pizza joint. We couldn't have been more fortunate as scanning Yelp, after trying several places, we found Joe's Pizza and they were open until 3:00am. We came in to a short line, got our slices, then, as if NY was waiting to see where we stopped, the place got crackin. We were there 30 minutes total and they had a line the whole time. After taking my first bite of my pepperoni slice, I knew why. The pizza was awesome! Love NY pizza and this spot was great, and open until 3:00am. Traveling from LA, we always land late, looking for food. We'll be back for sure!"
14-Jun-19,"This pizza restaurant is very well known in New York City and has won many awards. The service was incredibly fast and we were around the corner from the street! The staff was kind and friendly, and the whole atmosphere was what you would expect for a pizza place in New York. However the pizza itself, while I would say it was great, I wouldn't put the label amazing on it. I don't know if it's really ""the best pizza in New York"", but if it is, you may be a little let down as I was."
14-Jun-19,Caprese pizza was delishCrust was crispy. Just make sure you put Parmesan cheese on it and not garlic
12-Jun-19,"We were in town for a few days and wanted some good NY pizza. We heard great things about Joe's so we decided to stop by for dinner before our show.Although the line was out the door, it moved quickly - these guys are like a machine.  The only part I didn't care for was that if you purchase by the slice you have to choose from the pies that are in the case.  There are 5-6 varieties so it was fine - just not what we usually like.  The slices were very good - we had supreme, pepperoni and also cheese.  The crust was tasty and slightly crunchy.  We were fortunate enough to find seats - there are only about 18 seats - which was a big plus.  If you're looking for genuine NY pizza - Joe's on Broadway and W 40th is the place to go!  But for the lack of choice of types of slices, I would've given 5 stars."
12-Jun-19,"Pizza showed up burned, and the driver made me come downstairs from my hotel room to get it, even though the hotel will let them upstairs. The non burned part was pretty good though"
12-Jun-19,Absolute BEST pizza in NYC! Don't even question it-- just GO!!!! Went here at least 4+ times on our trip!
12-Jun-19,"Line is long but moves relatively fast. My recommendation is to eat it nearby if you want it hot. Cooled off considerably by the time we walked the slices (in a box) back to the hotel. I liked the lack of tartness of the sauce. Mozzarella was good. Out of the three, the crust was burnt on one. If you are going to buy four slices, just buy the whole pie (8 slices) for twenty-thirty depending on toppings. The closest chain pizza place with the same texture dough is California pizza kitchen."
12-Jun-19,"Loved the caprese pizza. As soon as I took the first bite, the crust was so good, it did bring me back to my days of growing up folding my pizza and eating it. D loved supreme pizza and DH liked his fresh mozzarella pizza. Line was too long but pizza did hit the spot!"
11-Jun-19,Pizza wasn't bad. Service was great. Ordered thru Grubhub and was told to expect it in an hour. 20 minutes later a delivery person from the restaurant showed up. Pizza wasn't too greasy and price was pretty good. Had a pepperoni and a half cheese/meatball. Meatballs were tasty. Pepperoni wasn't bad. Only getting 3 stars because there wasn't a wow factor really. But it's good solid pizza at a reasonable price.
10-Jun-19,"After all the hype I've heard about New York being the place for pizza, there are many different opinions on who has the best. I finally decided to try Joe's. Maybe I should have gone to the original location and not the one near Times Square. The pizza was burnt on the bottom. Don't get me wrong I like a thin crispy crust, but this was straight burnt. Ordered a XL with pepperoni and sausage and two of the slices had absolutely no toppings at all just plain cheese. Was not impressed and have had better pizza in California. Again maybe I should have went to the original location."
10-Jun-19,"When visiting NYC, finding food can be overwhelming, especially when you want something quick and delicious. Joe's Pizza was the perfect spot to wrap up our quick trip to NYC. We ordered a tomato, basil, mozzarella pie. It was perfectly delicious, I loved the freshness of the basil and the mozzarella tasted so fresh. My uncle and cousin gotta extra slices to go, they were very happy with the onion, mushroom slices.Atmosphere was lovely and lively. We were able to find stool and relax. The employees were lovely, very accommodating and service was quick based on our order.Definitely will have to stop next time I'm in NY :)"
9-Jun-19,Line was out the door and down the sidewalk. But service was still fast! My daughter wanted a slice bigger than her head. Joe's did not disappoint. Great pizza!
9-Jun-19,This is a pretty good slice of pie I had here.  You pick whatever pizza slice you want and wait a few minutes for them to warm it up.  You can see they got their assembly line system to perfection as you see the workers in the back working furiously to bake and pack their pizzas!  The slices range around 3-5 bucks depending on the toppings you want.  The sauce was really good and I love the cheese on top.  Great place for a quick slice of NYC pizza!
9-Jun-19,"A classic slice, there's a 99 cent pizza right on the corner of joe's if you are too impatient to wait on the line and don't have 2 extra dollars."
9-Jun-19,"Saw it on TV as the typical new york pizza.  If this is typical I am moving to New York.  Just great, my favorite type of pizza.  One of the best things about my vacation to Mew York."
8-Jun-19,There are no words.  Eat here!!!!!!!!!Slices are huge for the price and packed with flavor.  This is how pizza should be.
7-Jun-19,We had heard great things about joes! We were a little underwhelmed. They had specialty root beer which was fun. My pizza wasn't warm and my husband's was dry from being under the heat lamp too long. Hopefully just bad luck since many of our friends recommended it!
7-Jun-19,"The sauce is sweet, no tang and the dough a bit chewy, and nice crust. A good wait about 10 min to order 2 slices. It's also a bit messy, no one is cleaning up the mess people leave behind, no public bathrooms."
7-Jun-19,"Our first time to NYC. Was told that we needed to eat at Joes.  Here is my assessment:Service:  this is a busy place.  The line was long out the door however, didn't take long to get in and order pizza.  The peeps behind the counter are quick and move you right throughFood:  The pizza was ok. I don't think it was worth the hype.  They didn't have a lot of variety.  Again...it was ok.Atmosphere:  there really aren't many places to sit.  We were luck enough to get a table, a very small one.  But good luck if you can score a seating place.  I guess most peeps just take the pizza with them"
7-Jun-19,I ordered a pizza as we were wrapping up Top of the Rock. Walked back to hotel and the pizza was arriving as I walked up. The guy called when he was 2 min out to let me know. Great food! Great delivery! Super fast and friendly!
5-Jun-19,"Best single slice of pizza I've ever had.  Fresh Pepperoni, can't recommend getting whatever just came out!"
4-Jun-19,So I am glad I tried them out again. A much better experience. Phenomenal pizza. I got the extra cheese. Very tasty. Could do with a little more cheese. But overall. Outstanding.
2-Jun-19,Very solid NYC pizza place! This was my first ever NY pizza and it was quite memorable. Ordered their pepperoni slice for $3-4 per slice. The slice was huge -- there was so much cheese and pepperoni! A bit greasy but nevertheless very tasty and I was quite full and satisfied after.Convenient as it is close to Times Square and Broadway.
1-Jun-19,"I was really excited to try this place on my last visit to NYC. I was finally going to try authentic NY pizza! Service was quick and their prices are reasonable. To be honest, I felt like the pizza wasn't anything special. My pizza crust wasn't crispy and the guy taking our order was a little rude. Dining space inside is limited but there is a bench outside if you want to take your pizza to go. I'd like to give this pizza shop another shot the next time I'm visiting NYC."
1-Jun-19,We walked a nice little ways to arrive at a line out the doir. Surprisingly we did not wait to long. Decent slice of pie. We tried pepperoni pizza and white pizza. I would try again if in the area agsin.
1-Jun-19,"I came here on a rainy Wednesday evening and my spot in line was at the door. The line moved quickly. I told my order to a man -- two slices ($4/ea.) of pepperoni pizza -- and paid at the cashier. The slices were fresh, hot, and large, and I almost thought that I couldn't finish both slices in one sitting.Despite the place having plentiful of seats, it can be difficult to get one since it gets really busy and crowded. Luckily, I was able to snag a seat for one. The walls were decorated with articles, photos, and comments written on various international currency: proof as being both a tourist and local favorite. I left Joe's Pizza with a content stomach and would definitely go back again for my next trip to New York!"
31-May-19,"DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT GO INTO THIS ESTABLISHMENT THINKING THEY WILL SERVE YOU PIZZA WITH A SIDE OF RANCH. If you're a pizza enthusiast like myself, we all know that nothing goes better with a giant slice of pizza than ranch. The first thing I did when I walked in was ask if they served ranch which I then received a disgusted look on their face cause I wanted ranch and the gentleman told me ""no ranch bro, I guarantee you that you will come back for another slice. You don't need the ranch"". Even though I absolutely need ranch with my pizza, I made an exception for this spot. My girlfriend and I ordered 4 slices of pizza (2 for the each of us). I must say even though I had no ranch to add to this pizza, it was pretty delicious and I did in fact go for another slice and it definitely was not because I was drunk I really wanted another slice knowing I had no ranch to douse on it :(. Highly recommend checking this spot out, only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because, that's right...you guessed it...NO RANCH."
30-May-19,"For a ""Famous NY pizza Joint"", Joe's is a little unimpressive. This location is located right in Times Square and is likely to have a line. On Monday evening (On Memorial day) at around 9pm, we waited about 20 minutes to get our slices, which isn't too bad. My friend and I shared a Supreme (Sausage, pepperoni, onion) and a White pizza with spinach. I think the Supreme lacked a little kick. It could use some more flavor. I think this is why you see people generously pouring on seasonings like garlic salt and peppercorn. I think the thinness and the fresh tomato sauce are a solid cornerstone of an authentic NY pizza, but to be honest, I have had better and probably will not be back soon."
30-May-19,"Certainly one of the better pizza joints in the city.  Wouldn't say it's the best slice out there, but I wouldn't mind having this slice 2-3 times a week. It can get crowded and try to avoid 12PM- 1PM, the line will be long and you won't get to sit anywhere."
30-May-19,"Line is long and out the door, but the service is fast! We were fortunate to find seating inside but don't count on it. My husband and I each got a slice of pepperoni, and I got a slice of cheese, and he got a slice of the Sicilian. It was between $3-$5 per slice which I think is reasonable. Various spices to sprinkle on your pizza are on the tables, you'll need to ask for Parmesan. I would happily go back again and maybe even order a whole pie. You won't be disappointed if you stop here."
30-May-19,The hype was too much. Sauce was bland and cheese and crust hand no flavor. First pizza I've ever had to put salt on. Rag√∫ sauce had more flavor than the famous joes
29-May-19,Great pizza. Got a whole pie; half cheese half pep. Perfect sauce to cheese combination. Would order again and definitely recommend. Could of been a little more crunchy but definitely hits the spot for an actual NY pizza.
28-May-19,I couldn't have asked for a better slice! Crispy yet chewy and savory with a touch of sweet. Went in for one (pepperoni) and ended up going back for a second (fresh mozzarella) and was not disappointed by either! I'll be going back soon!!!
28-May-19,Closest to New York style pizza you can get. Get the caprese pizza and the plain cheese and you cannot go wrong. You'll be drowning in the flavors
27-May-19,"I know this is a highly talked about pizza spot in the city, and every time I walk bye there's alway a long line, so I was excited to go with my friends when we were all in NYC. The line was long to no surprise and we were excited for some amazing pizza. Sadly we were super impressed. The pizza wasn't warmed up enough- I think I need to try it again when it's not too late."
26-May-19,The line was out the door so we had to stop in here. I am rating this 3 stars because the supreme pizza seemed like it was sitting and they reheated it and burnt the bottom. I'd try it again but a slice of fresh pepperoni because I regretted my choice after I saw the fresh pizza come out. Huge slices and fair priced.
26-May-19,"So it is my first time ever in NYC! & I was dying to find some ""NEW YORK PIZZA"" and of course they are at every corner but no pizza has topped this one not only was it the BEST PIZZA EVERRR but it was cheap!!! Compared to paying 6-7$ a slice ! Only 3-4$ and the pizza was huge! I want to take some back to Florida"
26-May-19,"Guys!! If you are new to NYC definitely try this out. In the past year in NYC, I have tried pizzas from several places around my campus and they all taste good to me.(anyway it is pizza how can it be bad?) But after I tried Joe's, I would say they are different!! I got three slices: pepperoni,plain cheese and caprese. The best is the crust. It is really thin and crunchy in the edges. My favorite is the pepperoni one salty and greasy. Caprese is surprisingly good too. Just smell the baked basil, you are gonna love it. Limited seating inside the place but who cares. I can finish it on my way home. Food porn haha."
24-May-19,Iconic NY Pizza. The pizza is worth the wait!! It was not even 15 minutes in line which was great.
24-May-19,"Ahhhh..... This is exactly what I wanted it to be.  I just had pizza at some of the best places in Chicago (Gino's East and Lou Malnati's) and this was far superior.  A lot of that is because NY pizza is far superior, but if you just want to grab a great slice fast, this is the place."
23-May-19,"Went here for a quick bite near Bryant Park. The line moves really quickly, and the slices are enormous - one should be sufficient for lunch if you're not super hungry. Their mozzarella tastes fresh, the crust is thin and crispy on the bottom - overall great pizza for ~$4-5 per slice. Lovely and friendly workers as well!"
22-May-19,"Amazing pizza! The pizza is so thin and really delicious. The line is long and the wait for a whole pie can take quite a while, but definitely worth it. Going there for the first time, I wondered how good it could really be with all the hype surrounding it. Then I had a bite and understood. Eat it fresh before it gets soggy. The white pizza was okay, I would suggest getting the plain instead as it is simply amazing."
22-May-19,A must once you get to NYC! To enjoy joes pizza. Take the margarita it's so good and crusty
22-May-19,"Seating can be a bit tricky especially when it is really busy. There is typically a bit of a line but it is well worth the wait. One of the best slices I have had in NY! Also, fun fact: Joe's was featured in Spiderman, the movie!"
21-May-19,"Great NYC thin crust pizza (could stop right there)! No frills, limited seating, and service with that cranky NY attitude ( no extra charge). Had 2 slices with a client and loved it!"
21-May-19,Great pizza spot in time square! I had no idea they were in the spider man movie so that was pretty cool. The pizza is delicious. The slices are huge typical of the New York style pizza. I can't wait to come back and try the deep dish.
21-May-19,Great spot in theater district! The pizza is delicious and authentic to NY.. great sauce and crispy crust. I recommend!
21-May-19,"Must stop here to get pizza while in NY, the line was a little long but well worth the wait. I paid $15 for four slices of pizza, but they were like Costco size... DOUBLE the deliciousness. I recommend the Caprise!"
20-May-19,So. This pizza is soooooooooo good. Hot.  Tasty. At 12 noon or 1 am. Honestly went 2 times in 3 days or should I say early morning! We loved this place worth a visit guys.
19-May-19,"Lot's of people are giving Joe's five stars. Which makes me think I have to try it again.  But for now, I am giving three stars because there was just nothing special about it.  Nothing wrong with it either, mind you.The pizza is good for sure, but not like out of this world.  I thought the pizza I had at an Italian place a couple blocks away was better tbh.  The line here is super long but it goes fast.  But if you want to sit inside, that's really limited."
19-May-19,Just ordered delivery .. the pie came fast but the sauce tasted like someone dowsed sugar on the sauce and the crust was burned. Paid $30 for aPie and a drink and it was a complete waste! Mistaken this place with the one in the east village.
19-May-19,"The hype is real.  It's one of the best slices in the city.  I did a lot of pizza research before coming to NY and Joe's was a recurring recommendation.  This is NOT the original location, but it is close to Time's Square and Javits center.The cheese is simple perfection. The crust is thin and perfect.  Folds perfectly.  They have very limited seating.  I'd get my slice to go and eat it outside.  Credit cards only if over $5 purchase.Make sure you know what you want before getting to the counter so you don't hold up the line."
19-May-19,Decent pizza. The line moved quickly and the white pizza was pretty good. I was able to fold it and eat it while walking around which is what pizza should be--portable.  The white pizza is $4 a slice but pretty good. Crispy crust but I definitely could have used more garlic.
19-May-19,"This is kind of a weird one because my experience is highly inconsistent. Depending on the day, time, location and pizza of your choice, you can either get an excellent pie/slice or just ok one (even a slightly burnt one if you order delivery). So my rating can be 1 star or 5 stars. That being said, my favorite is white pizza. Will I go back? Probably"
18-May-19,Great pizza! I got two slices of cheese and the slices are HUGE! I found this place on Yelp while searching for the best pizza in NY. It did not disappoint.
16-May-19,"Most of those eating and reviewing here don't seem to be familiar with the fact that this is the 3rd NYC location of Joe's Pizza (original being on Bleecker St.).  The location on 14th st. is a more authentic rendition...it tastes fairly close to the original.  This Times Sq. location though, while still a solid slice, simply isn't the same as the original location.  The sauce is completely different, as it is much sweeter.  The one plus of this location vs. the original is that there is a greater variety of ready-to-order pizza combinations with toppings (at the original it is pretty much plain or pepperoni only)."
16-May-19,This place is amazing! I had the cheese pizza and the caprese salad pizza. Both were awesome. This is very cheap too. A MUST TRY!
16-May-19,"Usually great but got a Caprese slice that was too done for me, tasted burnt. Still like going there but should not have picked this one Tuesday night."
15-May-19,"The white ricotta pizza was probably the best thing I eat on this entire trip. Worth the wait, worth the calories, just overall so worth it. I was hesitant at first because I don't like greasy pizza (well, its more like it doesn't like me!) but Joe's was amazing AND I didn't get sick. Though I did soak some of the grease off before eating it.I should've ordered a second slice :( won't make that mistake next time."
15-May-19,Great spot in the middle of everything.  As seen on Spider-Man. . There was a big line and they took care of everyone quickly.  Love the NY style pizza.
14-May-19,"Yes this is by far the best pizza I've had in NY! We had the pizza and the pepperoni. Both were big and thin, the sauce is OUT of this world, full of flavor! The cheese was delicious and the pepperoni was tasty. Seems that most clients opt for the plain cheese, and being that I prefer the ""supreme"" pizza, I do have to admit their simplicity of the plain cheese slice truly let me appreciate and enjoy the deliciousness of the ingredients. I will always come to Joe's when in NY!!"
14-May-19,"I love Joe's pizza! Get it while it's hot and fresh and you're guaranteed to have a good experience! Tastes better when you're hungry and having a late night snack after a Broadway show ;) You can't go wrong with a $4 slice. I tried the supreme, the mozzarella, and the slice, and ended up liking the original slice the most. It's definitely an experience lining up for a slice amongst the crowded restaurant, but that gives it its charm. The walls have photos of celebrities dropping by which is fun to look at. The line might look long, but it moves quite fast."
14-May-19,"Exceptional,  pizza is amazing.  Great taste and great crust.  I recommend the veggie and meat lovers.  Always a go to for lunch and sometimes catering orders.  A must have for our office pizza parties.  Definitely need to wait but so worth it.Will definitely be ordering from again!!!!"
13-May-19,"Got a slice of the Fresh Mozz ($4). It was as big as my head!Good overall, however it did not knock my socks off. I can see the appeal with the thin and extremely crispy crust. But it's crispy because it's so dry; eating the edge of the crust that had no sauce was a chore.Fresh mozz looked tantalizing until I realized that it was dry and stringy like regular mozzarella; it wasn't soft and melty as it looked to be.Long line, but it moves fast."
13-May-19,Delivery was quick and on time.  Crust was good and thin and what you would expect of NY pizza.   However I felt the sauce was on the flavorless side.   I was so disappointed because it looked terrific.
13-May-19,"I ordered Joe's pizza for takeout with a few of my friends on a Saturday evening. The pricing was about average for 2 pies. They were delivered about 15 minutes quicker than expected, which was a nice surprise. The pies were average for large pizzas. They were average pizzas, a little doughy but good cheese and pepperoni. The slices were large so having two slices was enough to keep you full but not feel stuffed. If you're looking for a solid slice or pie for an average price, I would recommend Joes. One caveat was that the delivery guy was a bit rude and made a snarky comment that the tip that we gave him was not large enough. I feel the tip was standard for  delivery fee, and even if he felt that way I do not feel it is professional or appropriate to make a comment like that to a customer. I was put off by it and I am sure most people would be."
13-May-19,"I'm way behind on reviews, so I had to pick which one did I want to jump off with.  If you've read any of my previous reviews, you may already know that I'm New York born and raised.  It doesn't make me an expert on all things NY, but I'm pretty confident that I know what I like and can make informed judgments based on that knowledge.  I also know that not everyone appreciates the same things that I do, so I can fully understand the disparate ratings I see on a lot of establishments.With that said, I'm a new HUGE fan of Joe's Pizza.  I've passed it several times over the years, mostly because I don't like standing in line.  What changed for me this time?  My wife; she wanted to see what the big deal was.  Up until that point, I'd never even set foot inside, I'd just snicker at all the suckers lining up on my way past to or coming from Times Square.Anyway, once we got to the part of the line that gets to stand indoors, I got a look around and realized that there was nothing immediately special about the place, except for how busy it always seems to be.  It was your average, run-of-the-mill pizza parlor on a smaller scale.  Everyone knows NY is tight for space, so seating is minimal...a couple of round tops with stools, and slim counter space around the outer edges with more stools for those who want to eat in.  There's some of the same counter space just outside the place.  There is one thing of note that I mentioned previously- the lines.  EVERY time I've walked by this place, there's a line out the door.  But I'm a native NYer and so I'm not one to stand in line when there are at least a half dozen spots in the immediate area that serve up the goods.  But hey, I have an excuse- the wife wanted to know what the big deal was, so we get in line, which moved rather quickly.  These guys were fast, I'll give them that.  It's like a well-oiled machine in there.  Anyway, as I was saying, not a fan of lines, typical know-it-all when it comes to NY staples...yeah.All of which flew out the window with the first bite.  The basics, thin crust, well done, a good ratio of sauce to cheese and a first- pepperoni.  I usually do just cheese because to me that's the benchmark; they get that right the rest usually falls in line.  Again, the wife's influence.  As usual, I'm very glad of her input; it was the best slice of pepperoni pizza I've ever eaten in my 40 years of eating pizza.  We're not gonna get into how old I was when I first had one, I'm telling you- this was the best.  I've eaten pizza all over the city, all five boroughs and both counties on Long Island.  This.  Is.  The.  BEST!  The sauce had really great flavor, without being too sweet or too acidic; the cheese was gooey and melty without being weirdly elastic- and no burn spots!  That's usually how I tell whether or not the cheese is really good (and the pizza man knows what he's doing) - if there's a lot of brown spotting on the cheese, like you'd see at a chain restaurant, I'm reasonably sure it won't taste as well either.  Thin crust- some places like to make it a little thicker, or underdone so that it is a little chewy, some use too much corn meal making for a gritty bite, etc etc - not here.  The crust was perfect.  The sauce, the cheese - the pepperoni was excellent, flavorful and plentiful without overpowering the underlying goodness it is supposed to augment.  And not overly greasy either- which is a bonus, considering the pig that was on top of it.  The garlic knots were equally fantastic- yet another thing that you normally don't find outside of NY.  God, I love those things!As for the rest of the place?  It isn't much to look at, except for the many celebrity photos adorning the walls; if that's your thing you'll have a few geek moments as you recognize a lot of them.  One other thing, it is cash-only, I didn't see any CC machines and didn't ask; I was lucky that I happened to be carrying that day.So, is this the best pizzeria in NYC?    I know that I'll be visiting it every time I go home- there is no other place I feel like I need to go to in order to get my fix.  I know that we visited it twice- once on our way to TS, and again on our way back after a shopping excursion.  First time for everything, it was certainly a first for me to stop at a single spot twice in the same day.  And enjoy it so completely as we did.  So, it is for us; though your mileage may vary, I sincerely hope it doesn't."
10-May-19,Pizza is Amazing and my second time today but the cashier just got me for $10 so I'm giving a 1 Star. Ordered a Cheese pie and 3 waters which should cost $25.50 and gave him a $40 to only got 4.50 back AND I tipped him! It's on me for not realizing until after and I was too lazy to go back but you're a Sucka for that.
9-May-19,"First pizza we've tried so far in new York & it didn't disappoint! My only sadness is there's hardly any seating & definitely no bathroom. Super small business. It's crowded though & people have pulled over, run In, grabbed a couple slices and hopped back in their cars... So I think that means the locals approve haha They have caprese, white cheese, pepperoni, meat, spinach and more. Pizza ranges from $3-5/slice or you can get a whole pie. The slices are huge & good! Very crunchy thin crust. They have some outdoor seating & a few indoor tables & are worth a try!"
9-May-19,"Definitely iconic and has the tourist draw due to all the celebrity visits boasted on the wall and location. I personally thought the pizza was extremely overpriced for just a basic slice. It had a nice, thin Ny crust but the toppings were meh, not bad but didn't meet the expectations I had for a $6 ( I think?) slice. My mom and I actually came here and each got a slice and then went around the corner to the 99¬¢/slice shop to do a lil 'taste test' and we both agreed that they were about the same. Definitely try this place out of your looking for the touristy hype but many of the cheaper places are just as good :)"
8-May-19,Pizza is overrated i order it from uber eats it came cold and they were very stingy with the cheese and toppings i will never eat at this overhype place again
7-May-19,"Joe's you're almost the best pizza place I have tried in the city but alas my favorite dollar slice still has better quality and for cheaper. We stopped in for a morning slice, received quick service and enjoyed the decent variety provided. The crust was the best part of the slice but the pepperoni was a bit thick for my liking and the cheese ratio was OK. A really solid slice nonetheless but a bit pricey, probably due to mainstream popularity."
7-May-19,Can't get enough the plain cheese for only $3 bucks Absolutely the best We need one in Las Vegas Baby !!!!
7-May-19,"Super popular place. A bit too crispy for me but great flavors and nice, fast paced service. We got there at 9:45pm and the line was out the door, but it went extremely fast."
6-May-19,a solid pizza.I got the pepperoni slice for $4.I got the supreme slice for $4.75.nice crust.I like this branch better than the 14th street branch.
6-May-19,"Delicious! Great crust, great sauce...and from there your favorite toppings will make it your best pizza ever. The line moves quickly. The service is friendly. Eat here, you won't regret it!"
4-May-19,"I went here after my research on YouTube and because of all the hype about Joe's pizza. I ordered the Carprese pizza and the cheese pizza. Three dollars for the cheese pizza four dollars for any other slice of pizza. Overall the pizza here is overhyped. It is been big and I can see why people like it. There is usually a line so expect to wait for at least 20 minutes even when we went there at 11:30 PM. If you are looking for something quick, simple and like thin crusted pizza with limited budget, sure give a try but I am sure there are better places. It also depends on how lucky you are with the pizza in terms of whether it just got out from the oven or not.Cheese pizza - definitely better choice than the caprese one even with me being a big fan of mozzarella and caprese. Caprese pizza - the cheese is not something you'd image it to be in Italy or other places. Was not really good with a bit of sweet tomato sauce."
4-May-19,Hands down the best pizza I've had in NY ever! I've had some good pizzas before here but this takes the cake.  The crust is perfectly done and not soggy in the middle.  It's paper thin! And the cheese and pepperoni are cooked perfectly! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!
4-May-19,"Was in town for a few days and asked for the NY pizza that is a must. I was told Joe's. Place was packed but the line was quick. I got a slice of cheese and caprese and it was fine. No frills that make it extra tasty, but I guessed this is the style that makes Joe's what it is. I like more sauce which this pizza doesn't have, so if you like less sauce, this may be for you. I love pizza, so I didn't hate it. An overall fine experience with fine pizza."
3-May-19,So good ! I thought it was delicious ate 3 huge pepperoni and cheese slices  quick delivery might stop by again before I leave back to Cali (:
3-May-19,We made a late night order via grub hub. Delivery was on time and they fulfilled our request for a side of parm and even added garlic salt and some herbs. Buuut we did ask for them to add a side of marinara with a note that we would pay for it and didn't receive it. Kinda bummed about that but we loved the pizza so much it didn't really matter.  I wish we had pizza like this in Vegas. I could cry thinking about how good the pizza was and how delicious the dough was. We finished the entire pie and could've eaten more. They use high quality cheeses and you can taste that. I'm in love...with Joes pizza! I already want to get more but I'd like to eat in the shop so we may head there tomorrow!
2-May-19,"Grabbed our last slices of the trip at Joe's by splitting a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni with the husb. Both were amazing with a good chewy crust, nice crunch/fold and the sauce was spot on. Standing room only for counter service at 1:30pm on a Wednesday so maybe expect to take it to-go."
30-Apr-19,"I love me a good slice of PIZZAAAA. Every time I come to NY all i want to eat is pizza...I mean why not! Definitely one of the better slices I have had in my life. =) Service was great, employees were happy, and the pizza made me happy. Cheese was flavorful and it just made my day"
30-Apr-19,"Definitely the best NY pizza. The place is super simple and I loved it. Great prices and great pizza. Can't go wrong. I don't know any other place to get a good simple, slice of pizza! Always crowded and people are going in and out, worth waiting in line for."
29-Apr-19,"CASH ONLY! They do have an ATM right outside the door, but it's best to get cash beforehand! The menu is small only offering a few options, but wow....This is the definition of NY style pizza! The crust was perfect, and the amount of cheese on the pizza was also perfect. Definitely come over and try it out!"
29-Apr-19,"Easy counter service New York pizza, it's quick and there are a few places to sit inside and outside. The sauce is bright, the pizza is fresh because this place stays busy. I'd eat here again and again."
27-Apr-19,Very good pizza for the price. Not the best pizza in Nee York but if your looking for good pizza it's my second favorite here so far.
26-Apr-19,"Best NY pizza hands down. Perfect think crust, tasty sauce, and generous cheese! Also super affordable and accessible"
26-Apr-19,"It could've been prepared better. We got half pepperoni and half cheese but on the pepperoni side, the pepperoni was unevenly distributed. They need to make it look more presentable because it did not look like it was worth $23. The crust was burnt but other than that it was pretty good."
25-Apr-19,"Now that I work in the city, I'm constantly passing by this  spot and there's always a line! I usually like to wait for things to die down before trying a popular touristy spot. Just so happened that today when I walked by, there wasn't a line out the door so I decided to get a slice to go. I got a regular slice and it already came out fresh so it didn't need to be reheated. First bite was perfection. I LOOOOVE a thin pizza with a crispy bottom.  It was the perfect ratio of tomato, cheese, and crispiness!! It was ZAAAaaammmm, better than I thought! I love a saucy pizza and I didn't feel like it was overly oily. Def would get again and can't wait to go back to try their other slices! Joe's has a pizza my heart now."
25-Apr-19,"I wanted a simple classic NY thin crust style pizza slice. So here we are! This place has been around since 1975 family run for 3 generations. These slices  run you for about 3-5$ each depending on the slice/toppings. We chose the caprese, fresh mozz and supreme. You line up at the counter and you can see all the pizzas to choose from. You also have a line of sight straight into the kitchen behind the counter where they are busy making more pies.  After you choose your slice they warm it up for you, you pay and hopefully find a seat in this tiny spot. We opted to stand outside on the street where there was a counter and ate there. Weather was perfect and I loved the simplicity of just eating my slice outside. These were great slices! I love all the slices in their own way. The supreme is great with the sausage, red onion, pepperoni and mushroom.  All the things I love. You can easily eat through a couple of these slices because they are so thin and so tasty. They are still quite large in size tho! It's seriously all about the crust. I don't think I can find a crust like that anywhere at home. The crust has such a great mouth feel. It chews easily and if you take a bite of the slice you don't rip off all the toppings. The crust has a bite and chew but not so chewy that you get tired of chewing. The crust almost ""dissolves"" in your mouth. It's weird for me to say/hard to describe but it's just so perfect. I was beyond happy and satisfied!"
25-Apr-19,"My flight crew decided to venture down to Manhattan on a LGA overnight, and we found this amazing pizzeria with the best New York style pizza I've ever had! That's a bold statement as I've been to some of the famous spots in Manhattan, and this one takes it by far! For a Chicago style guy this place surprised my taste buds and slapped me in the face with its flavor. One cool aspect is that this pizza place was actually in Spider-Man, and on the walls are tons of different celebrities such as Ben Affleck, Bill Murry, Jimmy Fallon, and the list goes in and on of all the celebs that endorse this place. I wish I knew the name of the slices I got, but they were too busy to answer questions, so we were just pointing to the ones that looked the best. A typical slice is $4.00, and well worth it. Grab a table if you can, and enjoy it in house (if possible)."
25-Apr-19,"All the stories you hear about Joe's Pizza in New York City is true!!!After watching the Yankees, I am a GIANTS fan, in NY so I can say I did it, I was starving and wanted a NY only thing,  everyone said to go to Joe's for pizza. OMG, the line was long but quick, the pizza, the margherita, 3 meat, vegetarian were all delicious.  The crust was perfect, the pizza was good and my little rumbly in my tumbly was gone!I will definitely be back to Joe's when in New York again."
24-Apr-19,"Worth the small line we had! What's better than grabbing a famous pizza and sitting in Times Square to eat it?! It was our first night and the suggestion came from our concierge when we asked where was the best pizza in town? She nailed it, and the kids and I fell in love with New York the first night!"
23-Apr-19,"Classic. Amazing. So good I have trouble eating pizza at home. Amazing!!! You will not be disappointed. I would wait in a line around the block for it. Would eat there every day if that wasn't weird (and ya know, the whole diet thing). Missing this pizza already as I had it on a trip to NY!"
23-Apr-19,"This was the very first Joe's Pizza spot that I've been to (I have since pranced upon 3 and counting) while visiting NYC. We were actually running a little late to catch our flight out of NY but I promised myself that I would eat New York pizza before I left. So, we saw this pizza joint right before going down the Times Square/42 St. subway tunnel. I mean talk about a convenient location! Luckily, there was not a line so we got our pizzas quickly and made our flight back home with happy stomachs. The street food of NY is honestly underrated and quite misrepresented (people who say they get sick with street gyros don't have a strong stomach and should not be trusted) but this pizza spot is beyond words and definitely a must try!"
22-Apr-19,"Best pizza in New York. Melts in your mouth, seasoned to perfection, and at a great price, you can't do better than Joes pizza. The line is worth it, especially if you are only visiting New York. I would roll up in this pizza so it could surround me because Joes pizza=happiness."
22-Apr-19,"I genuinely don't understand the craziness and super long lines for Joe's in this location but I guess it makes sense for out of town tourists who want to try a typical NY slice. I've had the cheese, pepperoni, and my latest, the mushroom + pepperoni slice. It's good pizza specially because the slices are big but I wouldn't call it my favorite.They have some sitting inside and benches outdoors. Service is pretty quick & you can call and order pies in advance (:"
21-Apr-19,"This pizza slice shop is your classic NY spot. Famous celebrities come here all the time, as you'll see their photos posted on the wall. Peter Parker in Spiderman was featured working here as well.Joe's has really expanded and I couldn't be more happy about it. Now I have an excellent pizza spot in midtown.Joe's Plain plain slice is my go-to. The sauce is sweet and the slices are on the larger side as well. This location is about the same size as the 14th St location, so there is some room to sit down."
21-Apr-19,Came from Houston and was told I had to try joe's ! I was not disappointed . The staff was friendly and the pizza was great ! My family is from New York so I can appreciate a good pie . I would definitely say joe's is top 3 best pizza I've had in NYC
21-Apr-19,"Nice New York slice of pizza. Crust is crispy, sauce is tasty, and good amount of cheese. They have quite a variety of pies/toppings as well. It's a casual place with limited seating so good for picking up a quick bite or take out. It's definitely worth trying if you're in the area and open late if you need some good drunk food."
20-Apr-19,"Simple, fast and tasty. As always. This place doesn't give you a chance to have illusions. So you don't get disappointed :)"
20-Apr-19,Best pizza place in the city! Needed a place to grab a slice last minute and this pizza place was by far the best slice i've ever eaten
20-Apr-19,Honestly this place is worth the hype. As someone who goes into the city often I'm picky about restaurants.  But man this hit the spot. Perfect char on the crust and the sauce was great.
19-Apr-19,"Joes pizza was a great experience with great pizza. You go up to the counter and choose from a variety of kinds. The slices are nice and big and reasonably priced. It is some good NY style pizza. The only reason they didnt get 5 stars is because they forgot one of my groups slices when putting it back in the oven to warm. Other than that, Just a great pizza."
18-Apr-19,"Let me tell you about the first time I visited New York City. Everyone was telling me to visit the pizza spot that Peter Parker worked for in Spiderman so I added it to my list of things I must do before I leave. While doing the whole tourist thing, my girlfriend sprained her ankle on the red stairs in Time Square about an hour before we got to Joe's. She was in excrutiating pain the entire walk there but after waiting in line for about 20-30 minutes, (it was well worth it) we finally got our hands on a few delicious slices of heaven. We both got two slices each, 1 pepperoni (classic!) and the combination because we wanted to try all the toppings. After taking my first bite I could see why the walls were filled with pictures of celebrities that all had one thing in common, a love for some Joe's. At that moment, I too had become one of them (except not famous). The pepperoni had everything you want in a nice slice of pizza; They didnt skimp on the pepp, perfect cheese to sauce ratio and a nice dough that wasnt too crunchy or too soft. The trifecta. When I thought things couldn't get better I tried the combo. Words can't describe the emotions that I went through. Excitement, joy, even some tears. I'm guessing it's the same feeling you have when your first born is being conceived. Definitely the best slice of pizza I've ever had. The pizza was so good it healed my girlfriend's sprained ankle so thanks Joe! I love you:)"
18-Apr-19,"We came to the Broadway location after going to the TKTS booth, but have been to the Village location on Carmine many, many times in the past. I was nervous that the pizza wouldn't be as good here, but it was perfect. The plain slice here is the best in the city. Something magical is happening with that sauce and cheese, and I'm okay with it being a mystery.Will always grab a slice every time I'm in NYC."
18-Apr-19,"As a native New Yorker introducing NY stylepizza to my kids, I was disappointed that Joe's Pizza served overdone crust...but the name now makes it too big to fail. The signature folding wasn't really possible and the sauce was meh. Super greasy and because of the dough being overdone, no way to absorb it. I'm not giving up though....somewhere in The City remains a Quality Slice."
17-Apr-19,Great walk up pizza. Leave and sit on benches outside of restaurant. Even if line. It moves fast.
16-Apr-19,"So I'm getting some work on my noseAnd my belly, it grows, and it growsI've tried dieting twiceBut I'm into this sliceSo I'd rather get fat than skip Joe'sJoe's Pizza was my first New York Pizza, in that I used to go there all the time when I was a teenager. But to the original location in Greenwich Village, right off 6th Ave. Over the years I realized I didn't love it as much as I first thought, but I've come back to it recently and realized, f***, what was I thinking? It's as good as it was when I was 16 yo.Now they've expanded into Midtown (and to several other parts of Man Hat On) and I'm pretty glad that they did because although they are not the best pizza in Manhattan and nowhere near the best in New York City they are definitely better than 99% of what is available in Midtown, and they're top 5 Midtown slices if not #1 (and they might be #1, they're in contention), and they're top 20 Manhattan slices (easy), but don't bring Queens into the convo or they might slip way down, like I do every time Barbie has oil on and tells me to.So I was pretty delighted to see them around here and I hope that they continue to do well and stay open later and later because their products are good and from the taste of it it, it did not seem like they lost any quality from their original Greenwich Village location - if anything they are even better, and even busier, in this shiny new TSQ location - so kudos to them and I'm giving them five stars. Not even close, hands down, 5.Actually don't put your hands down... you'll drop the damn slice.So listen girls and BROSYou need one of THOSEA slice, I SUPPOSEAnd it must be from JOE'SI really love to POSEAnd Barbie always SHOWSHer boobies and her TOESAnd soon she will at JOE'S!WHAT."
15-Apr-19,Solid slice in the heart of midtown.  Good textures and flavors.  The lines are annoying so try to time your arrival.
14-Apr-19,"First time I came here, I wasn't super impressed tbh. But came back yesterday and had half a slice of the spinach pizza with my friend and was VERY impressed. I already had dinner made at home so didn't eat anything else, but she also loved the mushroom onion pepperoni pizza she got.Maybe it's sometimes hit or miss, but for the price I'd definitely come here and grab a slice or two if I was ever showing friends around NYC. The line moves super fast!"
14-Apr-19,We passed by Joe's on our way to a show and saw the long line. So we came back after the show to see what the hype was about. I ordered a white slice and a supreme slice. We had to stand and eat because it was so crowded but both slices were really good.
14-Apr-19,"There's quite a long queue, about 20 minutes long, but seriously worth the wait! Great pizza, really nice sauce, it's probably one of the best pizzas I have tried. It's not the biggest place."
14-Apr-19,Me and my buddy first official slice of genuine NYC pizza and did not disappoint. It was actually my favorite slice I had on my entire visit to NYC. johns at Times Square was second. There was no indoor seating but it was right near Bryant Park and had plenty of tables and chairs to sit and enjoy this tasty slice of New York pizza.
13-Apr-19,"A staple of NY pizza with a location that makes it worth it.  I have had Joe's a handful of times since it's close to my favorite cupcake place, Molly's, near the IFC and West 4th stop. I didn't know there was a location near times Square until I walked by this on a Friday morning and went right in! Line took about 10 minutes but they move fast. Although I typically get an original slice this time I wanted to try the white sauce and it did not disappoint. Not my favorite pizza but still a good slice."
13-Apr-19,"Great slice of pizza in New York! Said to be Jimmy Fallon's favorite in New York, we liked the classic pepperoni and the freshness of the caprese."
10-Apr-19,"I was hesitant to check out a pizza place that's so close to all of the basic ""touristy"" things in NYC, but with all of the good reviews and it being a short walk from my hotel in Midtown East I figured I would check it out. I am so glad I did. First and foremost, you can't help but notice the wall of photos of celebrities who have visited and love Joe's pizza. It is clear this place is loved by MANY people. It is also clear in how busy this place was. I visited on a Tuesday evening around 7:30-8:00 pm and it was a little crowded, but not bad at all. I went with the plain cheese slice and a slice that consisted of red onions, mushrooms and pepperoni. Both were absolutely delicious. I was honestly blown away with the flavor in this pizza. Of course I topped my pizza with some garlic powder and red chili flakes, which only added to the deliciousness that was already on the pizza. The sauce was packed with flavor and the crust was super good as well. And, of course, I folded the slice before eating it, which was a great choice! Def. recommend and can't wait to eat here again!"
10-Apr-19,"Have been my favorite since I moved to the east coast, Joe's Pizza consistently makes great thin crust pizza that are flavorful yet not too salty. You cannot get enough of it. One slice is not enough even though the size of the pizza is huge. You do not feel guilty after eating it because if you care, don't try eating pizza in the first place.My all-time favorites are the caprese, mozzarella, and cheese pizza."
10-Apr-19,"Joe's Pizza is a no nonsense place to get a nice slice of pizza, the New York way. Granted half the people who eat here aren't from New York, it's still a must try, drunk or sober. What's not to love about pizza at any time of the day?So they got pepperoni, white, and other simple flavors. Key word simple. It works, it's good, it's pizza time. Yeah it's probably overhyped at this point considering all the celebrity visits and Spider-man endorsements but good pizza is still good pizza. Is it worth it at $4 a slice? I'll leave that up to you to decide."
9-Apr-19,"Fast delivery and delicious!!!! Ordered from a hotel and they called me when they were in the lobby. Gave me all the essentials; plates, napkins, red pepper flakes, oregano, etc."
8-Apr-19,Busy busy busy none stop......... the pizza was delicious........I had cheese and caprese pizza both were great......... the location is small but a lot of love......I just wish the pizza had more sauce other than that pizza was decent.........there are some tables to sit..... advertised as you saw us in Spider-Man the movie........
8-Apr-19,"The pizza was really good, pretty crowded. But after tasting the pizza you can understand why. I love the photos on the walls of all of the celebrities that have visited this location."
7-Apr-19,"I expected and that is the problem... I ate it with gusto as I was full of tequila and beer, but I've had far superior pizza in San Diego. I will continue the search for the best pizza until my dying day.I'm similar to Don Quixote seeking the lost treasure of El Dorado, hopefully I don't lose myself on the journey."
7-Apr-19,"Had to visit this famous pizza place, of course. We decided to get a full pie instead of a slice, and it turns out you don't need to wait in line to order that (I found out after queuing 15 minutes). Getting the pie took another 15 minutes. Other than that: an excellent and piping hot pepperoni. Will be back to try other varieties."
6-Apr-19,Pretty below average new York pizza . They basically cater to tourists who do not know better. Avoid - even our kids who have a low bar for pizza were unimpressed. On top of it pizza was served cold.
5-Apr-19,"Quintessential NYC pizza! All I can say is crust, crust, crust. There is something special about the dough they use. Anyone can pile toppings on some half-assed dough. These slices are well balanced with great flavour on a excellent crust."
5-Apr-19,"Does this place even need another review?There's already been so much said about this place, by reviewers and by celebs, so I'll just add: I crave Joe's SO much when I'm not in New York.Dangit, I'm craving it now just thinking about it.Only try it if you want to ruin your life with the best New York pizza ever."
4-Apr-19,"This place is oozing with history on its walls. Dont let the long line at the door discourage you from going in for a slice of their delicious pizza. Many options available. From original to Sicilian - cheese, pepperoni, meat and onions, caprese pizza and more. I had the caprese and my husband had the meat and onions. Great choice and by no means was it the usual grease soaked pizza. Total opposite! Fresh ingredients with minimal grease. Nice light and thin crust. We were in line for about 15 minutes, which was great because the line was out the door and we thought we were going to have to wait for at least 30 minutes. The place is kept pretty clean despite the amount of people in and out constantly. The staff is friendly."
4-Apr-19,"Very good to excellent pizza.  But where they fall down is the long line to pay, which slows everything down. They need another cashier or a dedicated person that accepts credit cards (or a way to accept an app based payment). Getting your food is fairly fast - but it bogs down with the single cashier taking both cash and credit. There have been many times where I see the long line snaking out the door and I skip it instead of waiting on line.  If they hired one extra person during peak times, I would think they would increase sales by enough to cover their pay."
3-Apr-19,"Amazing pizza, we enjoyed every bite. Can't wait to go back! Seating inside and out. Place was extremely busy but service was great and the line moved fast was definitely worth the wait."
2-Apr-19,"Pizzas mediocre, the crust is too crunchy for me. Bit overhyped, and a ton of people at 1 in the morning still! My pizza didn't have much sauce and not enough cheese even when I ordered cheese with mozzarella. My companion had more cheese on the regular cheese pizza... I rather go to the $1 pizza than eat here again. Was not good pizza"
1-Apr-19,Decent for a late-night slice but nowhere near the class of pizza like Patsy's or Two Boots.  Order online and walk in to pick it up and look at the long line of people winding around the corner and contemplate selling those slices for $8 apiece. Kidding.
1-Apr-19,"Had the garlic bread and was wonderful. Was not too impressed with the margarita pizza basil was tossed on top of it, rather than cooked with pizza and far too much. Cheese bread was great but pizza was not worth the hype."
31-Mar-19,"My bad. I got drawn in by the Yelp review on this place.Being a New Yawka and pizza lover, I believe this place is average at best. The sauce is bland. $28 for a two topping average pizza. Way better options out there my friends."
31-Mar-19,"I had to try out this place just because I'm visiting NYC. I ordered pepperoni, combination, and white pizza! You have to eat it while it's hot! They make fresh pizzas all the time since so many customers are lined up! I will definitely try eat here again!"
30-Mar-19,"The pizza tasted so good that I could have finished the whole pizza all by myself. Spinach topping was excellent but next I'll try spinach on white. If you stay close, I recommend to order pick-up. Or just stay in line and order a few different choices and that could be fun, too. The only reason I take away one star is that the pizza was very salty for my taste."
29-Mar-19,The worst pizza I have ever had in NY backed up with the worst customer service. Gave me wrong pizza a pizza with no cheese and when I called they refused to change with another one was very rude and unprofessional. Want to waste $$ go there!
27-Mar-19,"I'll keep this short, Joe's pizza is fantastic. An authentic New York slice. When in NY it is a must to have one of joes giant cheese and pepperoni triangles. The ricotta is also a nice touch but they offer many more fresh toppings. There usually is a line but it moves fast and is always worth it. The price is fair and the atmosphere is New York. Not much room inside but there are tables outside which is better anyway because being on broadway there is a lot to see. This location is by everything so you'll have a lot to do close by when you're done chomping down arguably New York's best slice. Every time I'm in NY, there's not a chance I won't be at Joe's. Possibly every night."
26-Mar-19,"Delicious, tough to sit inside. Always jammed and a line outside, but worth it. $3-$4 for a quality slice. A number of different toppings, something for everyone for sure. If you are a pizza lover, best in the city."
26-Mar-19,"Honestly, how can you not love Joe's Pizza?  One of the greatest pizza standards in all of NYC.Obviously, this place is always crowded and has limited seating, but that's what you come to expect when you're in New York.  Their pizza is absolutely astonishing.  The simplicity of it all seems to wash over even the biggest skeptic.Their pizza is the epitome of late-night foodie adventures.  And that's the beauty of Joe's.  You also can't forget that this place has been featured in Spiderman!  Pizza by the slice has never been so beautiful."
22-Mar-19,"This place had mostly good reviews so I ordered a cheese pie. It's eight slices. Delivery was quick and on time. The pizza was stuck to the top of the box on one side. Already turned off by that. Decent size. As for flavor, I'm not impressed. Minimal tomato sauce. Minimal cheese. Pizza isn't hot. Crust has a nice crunch and is burnt in some places. Folds okay. I'm happy it's not soggy. It's definitely not greasy. I will not order from here again. It was worth a shot! The two stars is for quick delivery and my order was correct (Plain cheese pie)."
21-Mar-19,More hype than anything special!  They try to dazzle you with the pictures of the celebrities.  Order the pepperoni as it is the best one they have.  The Supreme sucks and is bitter tasting.  Guy tells me they give free refills then wants to charge me for a refill.  I told him you said free refills.  He replies no it's a charge.  WTF.  This is a NY hype spot.  Go to B side Pizza and Bar on 51st and 9th Ave.  Way better food and service than this disaster!!!!   Unless you like throwing your hard earned money away?
19-Mar-19,"Had this delivered last night and it hit the spot. Got a Sicilian style pizza, usually I just get the regular thin crust but I wanted to try something new. It was good, and the breadlines was great for me since I just had wisdom tooth surgery last week. However it didn't seem to have much sauce on it at all and I found myself wishing I had ordered an extra side of sauce or something to dip it into. I've also had their regular thin pizza tons of times, both in-house and delivered and I think that's definitely the way to go here. I'd give the Sicilian pizza 3 stars, but the regular cheese 5."
19-Mar-19,"This was the worst pizza I had since I moved to NY, dominos pizza does a better job .......my friend took I went to this new joes that just opened and we just had a regular cheese and pepperoni it's was bad ....I don't see what the hype is about ‚Äç"
19-Mar-19,"Small pizza shop with very few tables. The line goes out the door, so you know the pizza is good. I had the pizza supreme and the mozzarella slice, both were really good. The other varieties also look good. Prices are reasonable for Manhattan and the service was friendly."
18-Mar-19,Great pizza!  We ordered a pepperoni and had it delivered to our hotel.  It arrived super hot!  We'd definitely order again!!
17-Mar-19,"Is it just me or does this pizza taste like sbarros? Not much flavor until i added the garlic powder, but be careful cause it comes out fast."
16-Mar-19,"I don't get what the hype is about? Sure it's Spider-Man approved but I've had better pizza in NY for the fraction of the cost.The pizza slices here range from $3-5. I ordered the caprese and the pepperoni.Caprese was weird. Not flavorful and the pie was wet with tomatoes. Barely any flavor to be honest.The pepperoni was decent however the crust here is weird. It's like hard and very difficult for chew, left my mouth a bit numb trying to chew through my two slices. Also they were burnt so I tasted more of the charred pie than the actual toppings. Pass!"
15-Mar-19,The long line out the door moved fast. It was worth the wait. Great slices. Friendly staff. We'll be
14-Mar-19,If you aren't from New York and have always heard about NY pizza -- THIS IS THE PLACE. DO NOT MISS IT. Their regular slice is amazing and seriously unforgettable. I am born and raised in nyc and I get this all of the time. It never gets old!!
13-Mar-19,quick delivery and a great pizza for meat lovers. And I am Italian so if I say is good ...
13-Mar-19,"Best pizza ever. Best if you ordered Togo and enjoy in the hotel room with ice cold beer. Otherwise, it's crowded with people like yourselves waiting to enjoy the delicious tastes of Joe's pizza."
12-Mar-19,"Pizza was amazing! Came here on a Monday night at around midnight and the pizza was still freshly made! I ordered one slice for myself and one slice for my boyfriend. At the time of paying for them, the owner gave my boyfriend 2 SLICES because he said the 2 slices were small, which made a large slice just how it should be!!! Super awesome and great place to go eat at ANY time!I am definitely eating here again when I come back to NY."
11-Mar-19,"This is everything you expect it to be greasy,  cheesy pizza to fill your alcohol laden bellies at 2am. That's basically what we did. A few blocks walk from Times Square and a few bucks later our tummies were full and we were ready to get on our subway back home. No frills, quick and easy pizza!"
11-Mar-19,Unfortunately I was disappointed in the quality and taste of the pizza. It was extremely greasy and our pizza was charred. However I noticed that the pizzeria maintains a steady crowd during the day. We ordered late in evening and perhaps that was the difference.
10-Mar-19,"A must-go pizza place in New York!!! The pizza was fresh and it was huge. It was super crowded inside, but the wait was not bad. Definitely worth a try!"
10-Mar-19,Great pizza! The place is crowded with minimal seating but so worth the wait!! Had the white pizza which was delicious. Prices were reasonable and the slices are huge!
10-Mar-19,"$4 slices, or a whole pizza. Cheese, Sicilian, fresh mozz, white, caprese, supreme, any one toppings and salads. Quick service and seating inside and outside. Go here for a quick bite!!"
9-Mar-19,"Solid slice.. thought there Sicilian was actually a bit better than the plain cheese slice, but it may have been because I ate it first and was just hungry. I'd suggest it!"
8-Mar-19,"I wanted to see what the hype was about with this place. I finally stopped by one day while walking towards Times Square. The place was packed and the line was long. They took orders pretty quickly. I ordered a white slice and a fresh mozzarella slice. Since I could not find a seat inside, I sat on the benches right outside the restaurant. The sauce on the mozzarella slice was great---not too sweet and not too acidic. The crust was nice and crispy around the edges. Not the absolute best pizza I have had but it's worth the visit."
8-Mar-19,"With a plethora of great pizza places in NYC, a search for ""best pizza in NYC"" yields a ton of opinions on which places make the list. One place that appeared on nearly all the lists was Joe's Pizza. The original location is across town, so we settled for this location. By the length of the perpetual line, the excellent pies here are no secret. I tried most everything on the menu and it was all great. The fresh mozzarella pie, Sicilian square, pepperoni, and white pie were among the best I've had. This is a must stop locale for anyone staying near Times Square."
8-Mar-19,"Joes pizza is definitely a decent pizza in NY, however, do not order delivery.  Certainly a skill they haven't mastered.  The delivery person was very rude, and we had a communication barrier.  This was a major turn off which took a why from experience.  Pizza is very large so be sure to share the standard pie with at least 4 people.  Again, good flavor not my favorite or anything to write home about.  If you're hungry and see Joes pizza a slice would be appropriate and satisfying."
7-Mar-19,"I searched on Yelp for a pizza shop that had authentic NY pizza that didn't taste like paper (lol) and within walking distance to my job. I found Joe's Pizza and took the hike uptown to satisfy my craving for a TASTY slice. When I arrived (around 1pm), the line was literally out the door. I knew that was a good sign! Who else would stand outside in 20 degree temperatures for some pizza? Am I right? ;) When it was my turn to order, I couldn't decide on a Sicilian slice or a regular. I decide to get both and I was so glad that I did. The Sicilian was tasty and not overly crunchy which I like because it didn't scrape the roof of my mouth. I was only able to eat about 1/2 of the regular slice but it was also delicious. I will be back! Thank you, Yelpers!"
6-Mar-19,No exaggeration- Joe's Pizza is by far the best pizza I have ever had. The slices are huge and very very reasonably priced. It tastes so homemade! The staff is incredible as well. My boyfriend and I have been there 5 times in the last 5 days and each time the staff is friendly and pleasant. Very quick too! This is my #1 recommendation for pizza in NY!
6-Mar-19,"Place is a high volume pizzeria that doesn't care about quality or consistency, just pump out pies that crust are ALWAYS burnt and brittle... if you want to be a sheep that doesn't have tastebuds , follow the tourist and eat here otherwise go to Johns on 44th instead"
5-Mar-19,Classic NY pizza. Easy to grab on the go or find a seat to eat there. Very quick for a couple of slices. One slice cost $4 and it was a good price for the size and quality. White pizza was delicious!
5-Mar-19,"This place was the bomb.com, blew my mind!!!! Took it to go, man my mouth is still in flavor country"
3-Mar-19,"Classic New York pizza in a crowded messy venue. A definite 'go to' for pizza if near Times Square. Be ready to rub elbows with the other patrons if you go during dinner time. Imagine eating good pizza on a crowded subway train. A train with no one walking around and wiping down tables in between diners.  Picture large New York slices overhanging white paper plates being set on top of table/counters full of previous guests crumbs, paper straw wrappings and bottle caps.  Leave your hand sanitizer at the door - your immune system will be bolstered by your exposure to this biome."
3-Mar-19,"Confession: I've always felt indifferent about pizza. It was one of those things that was always ruined by cafeteria lunch food back in my grade school days. That feeling persisted throughout my life, and I never felt safe to admit it. All of my friends love pizza in all shapes and forms, and I never worked up the courage to say that there hasn't been a pizza that I fell in love with... until I came here.There was something magical about that first bite. My friends and I locked eyes at that instance, and shared an unspoken moment of deep intimacy. During that time, we knew that we were present for each other during this significant event. In silence, we ate. Nothing could disturb the significance of that moment, not the endless droning of the restaurant environment, not the buzzing of the busy New York streets. When we finished, we could only sit and stare, sad that it was over but content knowing that we had experienced perfection. The sauce was exquisite, the perfect balance of acidity and sweetness. The cheese is simple, yet managed to hit all of the right notes. The dough was made with a special secret ingredient: love. In that one slice, I experienced the rich history of Joe the Pizza Man, his hardships, his journey, and his life. It was over before I knew it, but I never felt such a strong connection to the food and its history. It was the perfect way to begin and end my NY trip. 5/5 stars."
27-Feb-19,"Ordered delivery from here. Came quickly, and was delicious!  We came to visit from NC and tried multiple pizza places, this one was the best!"
25-Feb-19,"Food: this is my favorite nyc pizza place. Every time you're craving that ""NYC"" thin sliced pizza, joes is the place to be! There's a lot of touristy restaurants that are over hyped but this place is famous for the right reasons - the delicious food! Service: its a pick up and go joint so there's not much service but the staff here are always friendly no matter how busy they are - they're always busy! Ambiance: you know you're in nyc when you sit with New Yorkers and tourists all in this joint.Love the food and ambiance of Joes pizza! I will always be back here!"
25-Feb-19,"Best pizza ever ! We came because my bf surprised me with a NY trip for my 30th and we fell in love with Joe's !! Best pizza I've ever had, we are from Cali and I'm not ever a pizza person. I dream of Joe's now and can't wait to go back to NY just for a slice ! The cheese, pepperoni... some other kind of cheese no red sauce ... the salad was so fresh with tasty dressing . I am so sad they are across the country, I love them ! Would recommend anytime any day!"
25-Feb-19,"You order pizza, they heat it up for you and you pay! It's simple, fast and the pizza isn't half bad. Seating is challenging but if you wait a bit you can score a seat. Also it's pizza so you can kinda eat it standing. Water is 1.50 which could be worse. Staff were friendly and moved the line along. For being in it's location and not being too ridiculously expensive it's fine. Ordered just the basic cheese pizza. But they had several vegetarian options."
24-Feb-19,Went to the one that is located in the shit show that is Times Square. Waited in line for about 20 minutes and got a couple of slices with the family. Great pizza by the slice! Highly recommend.
24-Feb-19,"I'm a big joe's pizza lover here. I once in a while go to the downtown location by 4th street. I was so excited when they moved up here by time square area!! I've gone several times. The first couple of times the pizza have been burned....ok....the last two times it's been stale. Usually its always coming out fresh. So it taste so goodJust went today 2/24/19 - They had several pizza ready under the counter. they slipped one in the oven to re heat :(I had it. Was disappointed after ordering 2 slices. I went to the guy at the front and asked him if they are making fresh ones. He just shrugged his shouldersI'll give it another shot, but they killed my excitement. Maybe just stay to the downtown one? if I want a below average pizza. I'll go to one of those $1 ones a block away. same difference"
22-Feb-19,"Simply perfect New York slices. I ate three slices, then couldn't help myself, went and got a fourth. They had to take me home in a wheelbarrow. Could literally eat this every day!!! Get there! Now!"
19-Feb-19,"Classic thin crust, big-as-your-face NY pizza.  It's fast and relatively well-priced and delicious!  Would recommend for a run-of-the-milk NY pizza."
17-Feb-19,You can never go wrong with Joes pizza!  Amazing good and awesome service! And of course it's a landmark. You've seen it from Spider-Man!
17-Feb-19,"Ahhh, this place is perhaps the most well known pizza place in NYC and thus a must-destination for tourists as well as locals (typically inebriated as this place is open til 3am). I personally think the pizza is overhyped and tastes like cardboard, but my boyfriend LOVES this place (""it's the perfect rendition of what one imagines NYC pizza to be"") and thus I've come here more often than I'd like. The line can get long, but moves fast and the interior has a decent amount of seating. The walls feature all kinds of celebrities at Joe's and newspaper clippings/quotes and can be quite amusing to read while eating. The reason why I give this place 3 stars is because I really enjoy taking visitors here late at night for a slice, then eating it in the middle of Times Square, which is usually completely empty past 1am (the only time I'd dare come here). Something about eating a NYC slice while sitting in Times Sq surrounded by lights and colorful billboards brings a nice feeling of contentment and out-of-towners get to check two things off their list."
10-Feb-19,"Pizza is undoubtably my favorite food. Everywhere I go I seek out to find what is deemed the best in the area and give it a try. So while in New York with my daughter I did some searching and decided to try Joe's. We saw the place from afar while walking up Broadway and the short line we originally saw had nearly tripled by the time we reached it. I generally don't wait in long lines like this. I've just waited in too many only to be rewarded with disappointment. But my daughter was committed to have pizza in NY and we we're already here so I agreed to wait it out. I was surprised with the speed and efficiency with which the staff took and fulfilled orders. Every member moved in this seemingly choreographed dance each perfectly complimenting the other. I read the many praises from past patrons on the walls wondering if they were real or just hype. The cold dreary weather outside had me wishing I'd chosen someplace where we could have been seated to eat as it appeared as we would be left to stand outside to consume our food. We each ordered plain slices and received them promptly and luckily a table emptied right in front of us after we had paid. I stood there admiring the slices, and as if a metaphor for what was to come, the sun parted the clouds and the grayness disappeared. I picked up my slice and was truly delighted. The crust was perfect! Crisp yet chewy, cooked to perfection. The sauce was just right with a bit of tartness just how I like it. My only wish was that I had ordered more."
10-Feb-19,Went at lunch time on a Saturday.  It was busy but waited only a few minutes at the counter.  The pizza case was very appealing to look at.  Had a slice of plain cheese.  I thought it was excellent.  Can see why this place is so highly rated and why people are excited to be there.
9-Feb-19,Pizza is was cold delivery was passed 30 after it was supposed to arrive. Crust was also burned on the bottom
7-Feb-19,"WHACK, do not waste your time coming here. We came here after because my friends cousin recommended it and saw it had great reviews, celeb stuff etc so thought WTH. It was not at all worth the wait or the cheap $3 cost per slice. First we got in line and the dudes behind me spoke only a little english. The guy serving the pizza was a total dick to them! When they asked what that was pointing to a non traditional slice of pizza, the guy condescendingly said Pizza with a huge grin. The customer seemed confused and taken back by the response. But I just thought, wow, the first A-Hole New Yorker I have experienced. So I took my two slices and noticed that both the bottoms were burned, but the pizza itself was luke warm! I swear the elementary school cafeteria pizza was better than this garbage they called pizza. The three of us ate our slices, well most of em as I didnt finish since I told them I didnt want to tarnish my stomach anymore with that crap that they called a meal. They both agreed so we tossed our pizza and left. I had to use napkins cuz its super greasy which is somewhat normal, but just a tip for you to be ready just in case."
3-Feb-19,A long wait in the cold was worth it for a classic nyc slice. Nearby walk to Times Square was an added bonus.
2-Feb-19,"Visited Joe's Pizza yesterday (Friday) around 6:00pm and it was busy, but I ordered my food within a couple of minutes. I ordered two cheese pizzas. This was my first time at Joe's and it was delicious! The pizza was warm/hot. The sauce was blended nicely and the crust was crispy."
1-Feb-19,"This place is a local favorite and a tourist hot spot.  Try to get a table for you order because it could be a long wait, and in nyc time it's decades. I hit the cheese slice and a slice mozzerala.The cheese goes by fast and it was my favorite. What makes this place special? I think it's the crust. It's the right amount of thickness and crunch. Well done gentlemen, great pizza. Will come back for round 2 if possible."
31-Jan-19,A) quick delivery at dinner time B) perfect thin crust with a great chewC) foldable slicesD) great sauceE) decent priceF) absolutely no complaints
29-Jan-19,"""Good pizza but overpriced""Listed as ""$"" however the slices are $3 per slice. I will admit it was a delicious slice of plain pizza which is their hallmark. I would definitely go again. You can find 99 cent pizza a few blocks away if you simply want a cheap slice of pizza to fill the gut.I haven't tried the other slices with toppings, but they looks OK."
29-Jan-19,I had two cheese pizza and a mushroom pizza. The line was long and they open late. I like this place. Roughly $3 a slice so def more expensive than the $1 from other pizza joint.
28-Jan-19,"My first Joe's Pizza! A perfect slice in my opinion. We tried the cheese pizza, white pizza, and sausage/mushroom pizza. Minimal seating but we managed to grab a table. Be considerate, once you finish your slices, get up and go! :) There's plenty of space to stand/sit outside when the weather is better. Only qualm is that the staff could have been friendlier when ordering. But we're all human, it could have just been an off night."
27-Jan-19,"Everything at this pizza is just perfect. From the Capri, regular Margareta, mushroom pepperoni, and Sicilian.Open until 330am on Saturdays.They deliver to my office fast!"
27-Jan-19,"I'm going to be honest. This didn't completely live up to my expectations. But this place is still totally worth the visit. I absolutely recommend it. I just heard too many things about how this is the best pizza ever. Open late nights. We went pretty late and huge line. It moves quickly. The slices are huge but don't be fooled. They are super thin so you may want multiple slices if you're really hungry. This place is packed and we saw many people eating standing up. I thought it was part of the charm. Great, noisy, lively environment. Absolutely loved seeing all the pictures of celebrities here on the wall!I recognized in the pictures at the top of my head: Anne Hathaway, Joe Jonas, Jonah Hill, Drake, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu, etc. Pizza has a light sauce. Very light flavor. I like putting the red pepper flakes on top for some heat. We tried the cheese pizza and the sausage one. Cheese pizza is the classic and you cannot go wrong with it. Great late night cheap pizza."
27-Jan-19,Long wait for a lukewarm pizza slice. I had the margarita pizza and it had maybe 2 slices of mozzarella on it. There are much better places out there.
26-Jan-19,"Must go to spot for cheap and delicious pizza. Although the pepperoni and the sausage pizzas were good, i preferred just the cheese. It tasted better to me that way."
26-Jan-19,"Not my favorite. On our quest to find the best NYC pizza this is not at the top of my list. The lack of cheese on my pepperoni slice could have been a one time thing but it was maiming pepperoni, sauce and crust. Cheese is my favorite part. If it would have had some cheese I might have been happier. Probably won't come back as there's too many other good choices. Try Harry's or Teresa's. Mmm."
26-Jan-19,"Ordered for delivery via seamless. While the pizza was delivered on time, they must have just throw the pizza in the box straight from the oven because all the toppings had slid off the pizza on to one side. Moreover, the crust was very chewy (and not in a good way), and the sauce is too sweet. I'm going to stop relying on all these reviews because 9 out of 10 times - the reviews are all off. There is absolutely nothing special or especially delicious about this pizza. I paid almost $30 for a large cheese pie and would much rather eaten a pizza from Costco for $10. Traumatized. Everyone who voted 5 stars for this place owes me a new pizza!!!!"
24-Jan-19,I love Joes pizza.  Crazy lines but moves fast.  Huge slices.  My favorite is mushroom and olive pizza.
23-Jan-19,Woooohoooo I popped my Joe's pizza cherry as my company catered a lot of pies from Cheese to Veggie to Meat Lovers (---my favorite topping because I am such a carnivore baby) along with individual bottles of sodas because they don't carry the large bottles!Awwww they gave us pizza cutters in such a cute packaging. Mmmm the meat lovers is a carnivore's heaven just saying hehe! Mmmm yummy thin crust. I am stuffed with just these two slices but I think I might go for a third slice lol gotta pace myself =)
23-Jan-19,We ordered Joe's the last night we were in NY. I guess I'm rating it against the other pizzas I had while I was there (which were better). Our Joes pizza arrived cold and didn't have much flavor. It was loaded with cheese and toppings though.
23-Jan-19,"There's a difference between the best pizza and your favorite pizza. This has to be my favorite pizza that I have eaten. When it comes to gourmet pizza, Juliana's is the best in my opinion as i stated in another review. BUT when it comes to good ole standard pizza, the classic, the OG slice... Joe's is the King. I have heard about it online, in the media, and even in the movies. I believe Spiderman worked here. It lives up to the hype. I would argue that the fresh mozzarella slice is a game changer. The highlight is the sauce which has an amazing profile. I would go to NY everytime and have this slice EVERYDAY."
22-Jan-19,"Obsessed with Joe's and all of their locations. The pizza is always fresh and so delicious but this location has limited seating and is overcrowded with tourists. Take your slice to go and eat it while you're walking down the street, like a REAL New Yorker"
20-Jan-19,Amazing pizza and they will deliver all the way to midtown (use grubhub). Pizza came on time and the quality was great.
19-Jan-19,Burnt pizza Hardly and sauce and the crust was over cooked I did not enjoy the sicilian pizza at all
18-Jan-19,Service was fast and friendly!!!! And they had great NY pizza for reasonable prices! When I come back I will absolutely return here!!!
18-Jan-19,"honestly the best pizza i've had so far hands down , it's a packed fast moving little pizza place . but the pizza is honestly the best 10/10 the BEST"
17-Jan-19,"So much hype and fame for this place I was expecting an amazing pizza. Although the pizza was good, the sauce tasted handmade and fresh & the crust was thin which I like , it was not amazing. Crust was a little hard and burnt which I don't mind but it was okay not amazing. I was just excited because Spider-Man worked there."
16-Jan-19,"Ordered delivery through Yelp to our hotel near Central Park South and received our large pepperoni ($25) lukewarm after about 1 hr wait on a Tuesday night. Definitely wasn't hot and didn't have a microwave so we had to eat it cold. Overall disappointed as we expected more from such a famous Manhattan pizzeria. I bet it would have been a lot better hot. The pepperoni was flavorful and the tomato sauce was lightly sweet in a good ratio to the cheese, crust was thin but very glutinous and chewy. Wish the cheese had been melty."
14-Jan-19,Joe's Pizza is #1. My absolutle favorite pizza. For a state that has great pixza everywhere you look Joe's is hands doen number 1.
14-Jan-19,I have been searching for good pizza and I finally found it.  I knew nothing about this place and just decided to walk in and get a slice.  Well  after taking my first bite I couldn't believe how good it was!  The crust is so crispy and delicious.  The sauce is perfect and there is just the right amount of cheese.  The way I know it's a great slice is because when I am finished eating it I want to order another one.  I notice that most people who go here order 2 slices at a time. From now on whenever I'm in the city I'm going here for pizza.  There is also another location in the village and the pizza is just as good there
14-Jan-19,Very good and the cheese to sauce ratio is on point! Pepperoni was pretty crunch and the sausage was a good chunk in size. Individual slice was around 3 dollar so there's that
13-Jan-19,NY style pizza!! Yum!!When I'm Santa Monica this pizza spot is a must!! I usually go with plan cheese slice. You can't go wrong.
12-Jan-19,"We just ordered the best pizza in New York City! It came much quicker than they said and it tastes unbelievable. The driver was awesome, the pizza is piping hot, and it's almost gone! Make sure you tip the driver well, we recommend this place whenever in Midtown Manhattan East."
10-Jan-19,"Great pizza but so expensive for each slice! Nevertheless, a great bite to eat especially in late nights. Came b/c of Buzzfeed Worth It"
9-Jan-19,Such yummy pizza. The trick is to go late or get grub hub so you don't stand in a crazy line! Crust is amazing and any pizza you get here is too good! The people that work here are really nice too! Don't be shy to get more pizza then you were originally going to get! Haha :)
9-Jan-19,"I think Joe's Pizza is overrated for the taste of the actual Pizza. I've had better Pizza in Western New York. Guess you could say New York City style Pizza isn't my thing, I'm biased. But the cool part about eating at this pizza parlor was that it was in the Spider-Man movie and it had a lot of celebrity photos on the wall and it's really close to times square. My friends and I just got in line in time, we only waited about 15-20 minutes to order. There's seating inside but since the line is so long and there's so many people there's barely any seating inside. After all it's a pizza place and in the middle of times square. After a certain time the line goes around the block. I'm not sure how parking works in the city because I took the train in and walked around."
5-Jan-19,"There's never been a time where I busted NY and not been here. First off, the location is prime- center of all the craziness/touristy spots so be sure you are mentally prepared for a really long line! Line may move fast sometimes but it all depends. Trust me, it's absolutely worth every second you wait. Pizza is always fresh. Any kind you get, you'll love. It's the perfect on the go slice of heaven you suddenly crave when in New York. Not to mention, it's been visited by so many famous celebrities you can't help but stair at on the wall. Location is open very late so you can catch them on anytime- pretty much. Give it a try- take some to go and go back over and over again because it's that good!"
5-Jan-19,The line moves very quickly.   The Caprese is probably the best we've had anywhere (nice touch of adding a drizzle of olive oil).  The crust is sweet and just the right amount of crispy.  The sauce is perfect.  Simply put this is just really really good pizza.
4-Jan-19,"How do you start 2019? You talk about the triangle of love of course... Yes this can refer to many things, but I'm talking about the cheesy, saucy, Italian slice of heaven that is Pizza. When visiting Manhattan you are going to be tempted by many many different Pizza's. But if you are looking for the honest real deal with great ingredients and that New York style crust it's Joe's. Joe's Pizza is hands down the quintessential slice of NYC Pizza. Great Ingredients, Great tasting Sauce, and perfect dough. Overall I would start your NYC Pizza binge at Joe's then judge all other Pizza places against it. You'll see at the end of the day it was the best you had.... No frills just really good Pizza!"
3-Jan-19,Best pizza in New York City.   The line was wrapped around the corner but moved fast.  The pepperoni was my favorite and the slice of cheese  and white were great too.  Well worth the wait!
3-Jan-19,Couldn't leave New York without trying a slice of Joe's Pizza. Decided to try a slice of White Pizza. It was different without the sauce but in a good way. Would recommend .
3-Jan-19,"We stopped by while on our east coast vacation.  The line was pretty long and this place seems to be a local staple but the line did move fast.  Our experience wasn't that great.  It's a thin crust pizza, the pizza was dry tasting and crust was burned to a crisp.  They cook that pizza at some point during the day and reheat it.  We paid around $4 for a slice of pizza.  Not sure what all the hype is about or maybe this is just a mediocre location or maybe we came on a bad day.  Either way, came for the experience and nothing to really write home about."
1-Jan-19,The line was 20 min long. There was maybe 50-60 people in front of us but the line moved fast. There are counter seating and a few high tables. Finally got to the front to order and see what the hype is about. I got the cheese pizza. I give it a four. I've had better.
30-Dec-18,"The pizza was rather bland. There did not seem to be any spices in the pizza sauce. And, the restaurant was a disaster. There was a long line of people waiting for pizza, and the store wasn't keeping up with the sitting area.  There was trash all over, and the trash bin was overflowing. Definitely not worth the wait."
30-Dec-18,"My GF and I ventured up from MSG after a show and were wasting our time together before we had to get back on the train home.  It was cold, cold, cold so we wanted a slice to warm us up.  The Line was out the door and, when I saw it, I thought we'd be Waiting All Night for our slices.  But the line moved.We split a plain slice and I got one with pepperoni, shrooms, onion, etc.  So, good.  Best I've had in NYC which means that it might be the best anywhere.  (NJ pholks can Weigh in on this subject.)   So, congratulations Joe's!   See the photo.So, why just four stars you ask?  Well, it was late at night but good God the debris from previous customers was extensive.  There were pizza boxes, crusts, napkins everywhere inside and out.  It appeared that the place hadn't been cleaned in eons.  My suggestion- hire someone to clean and empty garbage.  So, I'll be back to Joe's (I hope).  But I know that I'll be going for the slices and not the ambience."
28-Dec-18,Great pizza.  Had this delivered via Grub Hub using the delivery option on Yelp.  Crust was yum!Pizza was hot and arrived early.
27-Dec-18,Best pizza we had in NYC. We tired several different places and this was the best. The line moves fast. There is not much room to seat so be prepared to stand and eat. Got it a second time and preordered it walked in 15 minutes later skipped the line and took pizza back to the room and was still good.
26-Dec-18,Well you get what you pay for!.... Wait no you don't... you get more! Very small pizza place with delicious NY style pizza. It was very crowded but the line moved fast.  And I got a good sized slice of pizza for $4... it is hard to get a soda in NY for $4.  This is a must try place when you go to the Big Apple.  One warning.... no beer!  Sorry I like beer...
25-Dec-18,"Overall this was a good New York style pizza. Not sure if it was worth all the hype or the line. We had the supreme, ricotta, and caprese."
25-Dec-18,"This pizza place is iconic and interesting to visit. The pizza is good but not delicious. The pizza definitely lack flavor or some type of spices.  The line is outrageous and the wait time for the pizza is about 30min for an entire pie. I ordered two pies, the caprese and cheese. Both were good but not anything out of this world delicious. I feel that they are a little overpriced for not providing the best ingredients. Also I would like to add they must not skimp on the cheese! The more cheese the better! What's up with not having Parmesan and red pepper flakes. These spices are essential to a slice of pizza anywhere in the US. Over all I give this place a three because I really felt that I was going to taste the best pizza ever from the sight of the lines. Perhaps a bit overrated."
23-Dec-18,"Best pizza I've ever had, hands down. My boyfriend and I were visiting from Texas so we did extensive research on pizza joints to visit. This place was right down the street from our hotel and was constantly busy so we knew it had to be good. This was our go-to spot for a quick bite because of how quick and cheap it was. They have the pizza already made and will hand out as many slices as you want to eat. For some pizza choices, you'll have to wait since they aren't in high demand, but cheese and pepperoni pizzas are always available! We ended up ordering a huge pizza all for ourselves (here they call it a pie and only comes in one size) and it came with 8 big slices. We called ahead of time to pick it up, but they deliver as well. Definitely check this place out if you are in the area! Don't be intimidated by the line of people outside the door either!"
21-Dec-18,"No doubt one of the best pizza I have ever had in my life, and possibly the best in NY.  Yes the store is small and you possibly eat standing without a table (I did), but it is so worth it.  Don't be intimidated by the line...the service is very quick.  The guys working here are busy but they are efficient and nice!  I had a slice of peperoni and it was out of this world.  I was so impressed with their tomato sauce....it was bit sweet and that's how I like it (I don't really care for sourness).  I was so stupid to get one slice...should have gotten 3!!  Note: $5 minimum for credit cards."
17-Dec-18,"It is certainly better than the typical chains (Pizza hut, Domino's, Papa John's)... but in NYC, it is rather pedestrian. I'm not sure of the options around Times Square, so it's certainly convenient from that standpoint, but for NYC, it's nothing special."
17-Dec-18,Went to nyc for a week. Tried so many pizza places including infamous bleecker street pizza. This was my favorite and by far the best pizza i have ever had. I went back every single day!
16-Dec-18,"My fianc√© and I did our research on NY pizza and Joe's was on our list! The wait was about 15 minutes so it wasn't too bad. + Fresh Mozz - 8/10 - this was pretty good. The mozzarella wasn't sliced too thick and was nicely melted. + Supreme - 9/10 - the supreme comes with mushrooms, pepperoni, sausage and onion. I really liked this. The onions weren't too raw but also weren't overly cooked. + Classic cheese - 10/10 - my fianc√© really liked this. I had a bit and it was pretty good. He says ""good crunch with little oil"".Overall the pizza was good and I'd definitely recommend coming here. I wish there was a little salt in the sauce but it was still a solid slice of NY pizza."
16-Dec-18,Great slices...don't let the long line deter you it moves fast!  Sometimes the crust can be a little crisp and black on the bottom but really good pizza.
15-Dec-18,"Cheap and good. Big slices. Crowded. Somebody left a bottle of windex on a table though so that wasn't cool. Overall, good"
13-Dec-18,"I'm in LOVE with this NEW YORK pizza!! I ordered the cheese pizza.  Just add parmesan cheese, oregano & crushed red pepper flakes & your good to go!"
13-Dec-18,"Saw the good reviews and close to our hotel so had to give it a try. Line was long outside but things moved quickly. Limited seating inside but we were able to get some stools. Pizza was good but not great. Honestly I have had better NY style pizza in San Antonio. Slices were big, pizza was hot and fresh, price seemed fair for NYC $3 for slice of cheese pizza. Lots of celeb pics on the wall so obviously they have a good rep but I suspect I may have better pizza other places here in the city"
11-Dec-18,"Gave this place another try, again it was ok, I do not know why people love the pizza here, there are better options such as Sacco's and Pizza Palace if you are in Manhattan, the pizza was just ok, nothing special, I have had worse and I have had better."
9-Dec-18,"It was my first time in NYC, how could I not stop by! The line was out the door, but it moved quickly and I was up at the counter in no time. Ordered a slice of white pizza to go - the employee popped it in the oven to heat up a bit while I waited to get to the cashier to pay.The pizza was delicious! I had been looking forward to trying white pizza, and boy was it worth it! I sat across the street at some outdoor tables and enjoyed the ooey gooey cheese that stayed warm despite the crisp, cold winter breeze that blew through.I'd definitely come back, maybe next time I'll drag some friends along and get a whole pie to enjoy at a table or outside again!"
6-Dec-18,"It was my first time in New York..I actually walked an hour to 2 Bros Pizza and they were closed.. sadly my directions took me out on a wild goose chase and I had 1% left on my phone! After walking around to what should have only been 7 min from my hotel I was so disappointed they closed so I found joes and the same thing happened.. 1hr later equaling 2 hours looking for pizza, well good pizza, I found joes.. I got into line and this guy was yelling out next probably 50x in the 2 min I stood there.. they have a tiny menu that I saw once I was in line but it was non-viewable and to the opposite side of the line.. finally I was ready to order once I was able to see what pizzas he had.. he looks over past me and takes the next person after me and says, I'm cutting him in front of you ..the couple behind me was like so rude! Then he ignores me.. I proceed to tell him it was my first time in New York and that he put a really bad taste in my mouth of New Yorkers.. I heard they were rude but I wanted to see for myself.. I told ""Sam"" which is what he called himself.. that saying next next next a million times and I don't even know if the person ahead of me had ordered was ridiculous and then to cut someone ahead of me was rude! He had an attitude with me and started laughing as I was speaking.. I get that we're just a cattle call to you but we are human beings and good customer service is what makes a company successful! I walked out and you guys lost business! Not just mine but many people I work with visiting being that I'm a flight attendant and a travel blogger will hear about this experience.  Learn some customer service skills because not all people entering your establishment are New Yorkers and you never know who is walking in! And Sam probably gave me a fake name but he looked bald, he was tall, thin and had a big mouth!The owner sent me a very kind message and was very apologetic. Sam is new and I guess he needs some work but I was very impressed of the way the owner cared enough to message me hoping to make it right. Hopefully I can make it out there soon and tell my coworkers to give them a try but avoid Sam! Lol"
5-Dec-18,We had big daddy's on our must do's when visiting New York City because we've heard it's the best pizza in NYC. They were not kidding. We tried 3 different types of pizza and were amazed by all 3. The crust has the perfect amount of crunch and the cheese is out of this world! My favorite was the spinach and cheese one! I would definitely go back the next time we are in the city!
5-Dec-18,"I heard after my trip that the thing to get here is the cheese pizza. I got the pepperoni slice. It's quite a large slice, and the crust is really good. It was the perfect thickness and firmness that I like. Came for lunch so there was a line but it goes by quick. You can also sprinkle some garlic powder on  your pizza.I guess Joe's is like a good standard pizza. I've had better pizza, but this one is not bad either, and definitely good for the price."
11-Nov-18,"Good pizza, but not the best in NY. The store in Times Square also gets way too much traffic (obviously given location) so the pizza sometimes doesn't really get hot enough when they reheat slices. So the crust doesn't really get as hot and crisp as it needs to.It's a good slice, but not the best in NY. The Joe's in the West Village is a bit better IMO."
11-Nov-18,Authentic New York style pizza. Joe's was a recommendation as a must in our trip. Several people attending the BDNY Show said that if we wanted the best pizza while we were in New York Joe's was the place. Small sitting area so we ended up on the bench outside but definitely worth the wait. Didn't notice until we were leaving that there were tables and chairs across the road that we could have used.
9-Nov-18,"This place is in a great location! You have many stores around for shopping. However the place is small so be prepared to stand and eat. The pizza is worth the wait!! I visited the location around 1:00AM and it was messy, but again that could be because it was packed and the time. I gave it 3 stars because it was messy and small, I would of give it a 5 because the pizza was great!!!!"
8-Nov-18,"I LOVED this pizza. Of all the pizza places we tried on our trip to NYC, this was the favorite.  Crispy thin crust, toppings were very fresh, pizza was perfect!"
8-Nov-18,"Definitely not the same as the Joe's of the original location. This place is using the reputation of the name to deliver high priced pizza. This place must be a packed house when tourist are around. Tourists don't know any better but this is not the best New York City has to offer. Sure this pizza might taste good if you're drunk and hungry but NY has way way better pizza than this. This is a franchised store and has none of the charm of the original or even 14st location. If you need something quick, this Joe's pizza still offers better than average slice. The cheese and sauce both good but the crust had no flavor. For $3 for a plain cheese slice, NY can do better. I gave the Joe's on 14th street a 4 star because they had better pizza. This is above average pizza at best and still overpriced. Tip: John's of Bleecker hands down the best in town."
8-Nov-18,A quintessential NYC slice. Can't go wrong here but nothing to write home about. It's the Dasani of pizzas. -1 star for making my date have to pay extra for her slice and being rude about it. She literally started crying and people gave me rude looks like it was me. Good sauce though would come back.
6-Nov-18,"Finding the best pizza in New York can be difficult. When we were searching for the best Joe's came up every time! We went to the broadway location as it was the closest. The inside is small and you're lucky if you can grab a seat. Don't let the line fool you because it moves fast! They were ready to take everyone's orders very quickly so we were prepared to ask for 1 slice of pepperoni to go in a bag. Our shared slice was thrown on a paper plate and into a bag. If you buy more you can get it in a pizza box. Wow, I wish we had gotten more! This was definitely the best New York pizza I've had yet. Don't waste your time elsewhere and just find your closest Joe's! There were lots of options and you can watch them make the pizzas in the back."
5-Nov-18,"So many pizza options in NY, but I chose this one to try because it was closest to where I was at the moment. The pizza in general was not bad. The slices were big, but very thin. I'm from Cali, so I like my dough a little thick. I could easily eat 4 slices and still not be full with how thin these slices are. That's an east coast/New York thing though. I got a regular slice for my mom and I had a mozzarella slice for myself. My mom said her slice was a little burnt, but mines was fine. The sauce wasn't anything special,  just normal sauce to me. With the hype online I felt the pizza should have been way better. Would I try them again? Sure I would try a different slice."
5-Nov-18,Outstanding pizza! This was my first time in NYC and after hearing all the hype about New York pizza I had pretty high standards to be met and Joe's knocked my socks off! We grabbed a slice while walking down Broadway - the service is good and fast and the prices are reasonable! We loved it so much that we came back the next day for more!
3-Nov-18,"Delicious pizza by the slice and fast. Ordered, they warmed, paid, and I was out. Would love to give 5 stars if the tables were clean and we had a place to sit inside."
29-Oct-18,"Meh, I don't get it, had to wait in line for about 15 minutes on a Friday night. I didn't find it to be anything special."
29-Oct-18,"Joe's nails New York street pizza.  You know, the type that you get from one of those little shops where they have all of the big, pre-cooked pizzas laid out on the counter.  The kind of place where you order pizza by the (large) slice and the person behind the counter has to reheat it in the oven before you can go stand outside somewhere to eat it.Yeah, Joe's is that kind of place and it makes terrific pizza.  The crust is just the right thickness that it is a total pain to handle while standing outside and the sauce is just watery enough that all of the hot toppings start to slip off as soon as you go to take your first bite.  The slices are so big that you have to bend them in half to just get them to your mouth.  The crust and cheese have those blisters that can only form in a blazing hot oven.  The flavor is rich, but not too salty, with just the right amount of refreshment and sweetness from the sauce.  There is just enough crunch, chewiness, and stringiness to make your mouth tingle with excitement.I just wish they had boxes rather than bags for takeout since with just a bag the pizza can get cold pretty quickly.Joe's Pizza is not a fancy establishment and lands on the pricier end of its market (~$4/slice), but it nails its product.  Don't waste your time anywhere else unless you just can't take the line."
24-Oct-18,"Famous hot spot in Times Square that is worth the stop. Pizza is perfect and service is swift. Busy or not, you'll get in and out without much wait. Pizza is delicious, though, so you may leave with more weight!"
23-Oct-18,This is the Midtown outpost of the downtown original(s). Solid New York style pizza open fairly late. Joe's is a slice that won't disappoint.
22-Oct-18,"Come here every time I'm in New York! This is the best pizza around and everyone knows. Line goes out the door most times but it moves quick and I can assure you it is worth the wait. Ordered the supreme, caprese, and spinach slices. All great but my favourite is the spinach. It has a thin crust and its simplicity makes you appreciate every single bite. Come here for hot fresh pizza You won't be disappointed!"
22-Oct-18,"This place always has lineups out the door but it is so worth the wait! Tried the caprese as well as the white pizza with spinach and both were amazing. My all time favourite is definitely the spinach one. The location is super convenient, near Times Square, so it's the perfect place to grab a late night snack."
22-Oct-18,"I visited NYC this past weekend (19-21 October) and I did not know about Joe's Pizza until I got here. This location is in midtown Manhattan and not too far from Bryant Park and Times Square.I came here while I was walking around with a friend while trying to find a place to eat. The place is small and seating is very limited but most people come and go (take out) or eat real quick then leave. This isn't a spot to sit down and eat.FOOD -- I ordered the Caprese pizza (1 slice) - it had Mozzarella cheese, tomatoes, and basil. I thought it was good but I was hoping for a better taste. I added crushed pepper flakes to it and that spiced up the flavour. I was hoping to eat better pizza because of all the raving reviews that I read. Perhaps I should have ordered the Pepperoni but either way, the pizza was just fine. I was excited to try New York style (thin-crust) pizza and Joe's Pizza was just okay. Perhaps my tastebuds are different from yours so I will still recommend that you go check out this place to make the decision for yourself.ATMOSPHERE -- Chill and fun. The line was long around mid-afternoon on a Sunday but it moved quickly and the staff was very nice. The inside feels like a basic place but I loved the photos on the wall of all the celebrities who have visited the original Joe's Pizza location in the West Village (Jimmy Fallon, the Olsen Twins, Sarah Jessica Parker, etc).Overall review is 3.5/5.0****This is my 135th Yelp review overall. 89 reviews for 2018.I am aiming for 100 reviews in 2018.Ate here on 21 October 2018.Reviewed on 22 October 2018."
21-Oct-18,"After a night out, he said he was hungry and wanted some pizza. On our way back to our hotel, we found Joe's. It was midnight and it was crowded. Every table inside was occupied and the line to order was out the door. And the people inside didn't look drunk.These are good indicators that the food should be good. After browsing the options, he settled on a slice of supreme pizza. $4.75 isn't exactly cheap and he generously shared a few bites with me. Meh, I'm not a pizza person and maybe it's my own inability to distinguish good pizza from bad. It tasted alright but I had enough after a couple of bites. He finished that slice of pizza and decided to stand in line again for two more slices. Due to his enthusiasm for the pizza, I'm rounding up my rating to 3 stars."
20-Oct-18,Gave a one star because im unable to give zero star. This was one of the worst pizza i've eaten in my 30 years living in nyc.... they suppose to be good but second joe's pizza i've gone too and the pizza were the sane flavorless and burnt...
19-Oct-18,"Really enjoyed Joe's Pizza.  Took almost an hour to get a table after we were told 15-20 minutes.  Not sure I would have waited for N hour after you basically stand in front of the bar.  Nowhere else to wait as you need to see when your table # comes up to get your table.  Aside from that, very good Pizza.  We had the Margherita along with a couple sides of their Meatballs and Cheese Garlic Bread.   Throw in a few beers and White Russians and you have a nice dinner.  Just over $100.  Large restaurant.  Loud but good energy."
18-Oct-18,"Came here with a co worker for lunch as part of a recommendation.  Line moved quickly and I got 3 slices of pizza: Caprese, mozzarella, and pepperoni.  Really solid thin crust pizza.   Also, if you look at their wall you'll see their pictures with a bunch of celebrities."
18-Oct-18,"The Joe's Pizza on Carmine is literally my FAVORITE pizza in the world, but I hadn't yet tried this location over on Broadway until a few weeks ago.This location is a lot more poppin' because it's right off Times Square. At night, while you're waiting in the out-the-door line, you've got tons of neon signs and bright billboards behind you. But did you catch that? Yes, there is nearly always a line out the door. (Except one time, I must've just caught the tail end of the lunch rush, because by the time I walked out of the shop, there was NO line at all??) But the line moves very quickly and you can help it along:- When the man at the counter asks what you want, give him your order promptly please! (Our order: one plain, one pepperoni)- Have cash ready OR pay by credit card if you're spending more than $5- Grab your slice and maybe find a table inside (highly unlikely), a spot at the hightops inside (slightly more likely), or a spot at the hightop outside (even more slightly likely; this is where we munched each time). Shakers of parmesan, chili flakes, and oregano can be found on most of the tables. The pizza is great. I love Joe's for their sauce and their crust, but I have found this location is not always super consistent; the first slice I had was too charred and crisp from overbaking and didn't have enough sauce on it. But, it's still a great, classic slice. I still prefer the Carmine Street location for being more consistent and being a little more chill during the day, and I wonder if the pricing might be slightly different (although I wasn't able to visit the other location during the same weekend to compare), but honestly...... you will never go wrong with Joe's."
18-Oct-18,It was 1am and we were looking for places that delivered and found Joe's Pizza. Totally worth it. Best NY pizza so far
17-Oct-18,"Best Pizza we've had in New York. Don't give me fancy, don't give me expensive toppings. All I want is cheese and pep at 1am. Perfect."
17-Oct-18,"I am writing from the perspective of delivery, not eating in the restaurant.  The pizza was delicious and very big.  We were staying at a local hotel and had a craving for NY Pie, so ordered a large with half sausage/meatball and left the second half plain.  Nothing better than a good cheese pizza right?  WRONG...their meat is delicious and plentiful and really added to the already great Joe's pizza taste.  It was delivered fast and piping hot.  Joe's is just good, no doubt about it!"
17-Oct-18,This is one the best places in Manhattan for old school New York style pizza.  Simple quality ingredients done right.  They also deliver which is an added bonus.
16-Oct-18,"Sure the pizza here is pretty good, but beware of being ripped off. My 11 year old son and I stopped in here after a long bus ride from Boston to get two slices of pizza and two sodas--for $24! Apparently the cashier saw a couple of out of towners with backpacks and assumed he can charge double to line his pockets. When I confronted him in front of his coworkers he claimed he misheard our order and gave us back $10 but I'm sure these guys ""mishear"" all the time when they see someone they can take advantage of.  Absolutely disgusting. I'd rather eat a soggy doughy blob of traditional New England pizza than get a slice of dishonesty from Joe's Pizza."
14-Oct-18,When in NY you must eat pizza!  Joe's is a great place to get pizza by the slice.  A no frills legit slice.The line can be quite long at most locations and this one is no different.  But it moves quite quick!  And if you aren't ready to tell one of the guys at the front when it's your turn be sure you will be met with annoyance.  And maybe even anger. Lol!  I am a pepperoni kind of gal.  Nothing better than a slice of piping hot NY pizza.  Don't need the hipster toppings and Joes is a great place for a big slice of pepperoni and cheese pizza!
14-Oct-18,I like their pizza with the onions and mushroom to me that's the best one. Came back for the pepperoni but it was ok.
13-Oct-18,"Decided to give this place a shot after hearing so many great things about it. We ordered both thin crust and deep dish pepperoni pies. I recommend going for the thin crust. So much better than the deep dish as the deep dish lacks sauce and dough is a little weird. The sauce on the thin crust was delicious though and had the perfect amount. Overall, this pizza is really good! Not the best pizza I've ever had, but definitely good enough to keep me coming back."
3-Sep-18,"New York Pizza doesn't get better than this.  Thin slices , fresh, and piping hot.   Had both the fresh mozz and cheese pizza , both were fantastic and exactly what i expected out of a new york pizza.  Always a small lineup and crowded with people at this location but the line moves quick.   Would definitely come again if walking by the area.  Two thumbs up for legit pizza here in New York City."
3-Sep-18,Definitely more on the expensive side for just one slice of pizza but it's a generous size and really good! Have to come back again for more
2-Sep-18,"Perfect late night spot to satisfy the hangry cravings after a booze stroll around the crazy city of NY. The slices range from $3 ish a slice (which isn't cheap) but the pizza was delicious. It was thin crusted, not greasy and packed with flavor. I got the classic Margherita slice and boy, it did not disappoint!"
30-Aug-18,"Had Joe's today for the first time and was blown away their pep slice. So much in fact, I had it again a second time today, delivery. Delivery came fast, and the pie is superb! If you're looking for an excellent traditional New York thin crust, be sure to stop by Joe's!"
30-Aug-18,"We ate here twice. Once we beat the line that always seems to be there, but even with the line it moves pretty quick and it's worth the wait. The pizzas are being sold so quickly that we always had a fresh piece. During our visits we had the sausage and pepperoni, pepperoni and tomato and mozzarella. Our favorite was the sausage and pepperoni. Both times we ate there. The tables are always full, but most people follow the eat and leave courtesy. So by the time we were out of line we were able to grab 2 seats. I was excited because unlike a lot of other establishments they had Diet Dr Pepper! Lol the pizza was fresh, delicious and fairly quick. Definitely worth a check mark on your To Do list while in NYC."
27-Aug-18,"The line at the shop was out through the front door, get in it! That pizza is well worth the wait and the line moves super fast. It's delicious and exactly what you'd think of as legit authentic New York pizza! The ingredients are fresh and delicious!"
26-Aug-18,"I walked here two days in a row. I just tried cheese but if the cheese is good who needs toppings. The crust ended up being a little crunchy I probably shouldn't have had them reheat the pizza. But he sauce and cheese were good. I sprinkled some Parmesan, Italian seasoning and crushed peppers with a root beer I was good to go. Line moves fast. Take it to go or eat it across the street.  Stays open late."
25-Aug-18,Some good ol' New York pizza! This location was pretty busy and had a line going out the store but the service was speedy and the pizza was delicious. Huge slices for less than $5. It was also pretty cool to see all the pictures of celebrities eating Joe's Pizza on the wall.
22-Aug-18,"Was staying in Times Square and wanted a great New York pizza experience. My pizza experiences were underwhelming the past few times I visited NYC. Last time I had gone to the supposed number 1 pizza place in the world and ended up being disappointed with their pies. Joe's pizza definitely satisfied my cravings. I tried the mozzarella, white, and cheese pizzas. They were all fantastic! The only downside is that the lines can get long during lunch/dinner time and sometimes you can get a slice that's been sitting around for a while. Great experience overall and definitely my fav NYC pizza so far."
18-Aug-18,"Got a slice of the fresh mozzarella , slice of white and a slice of pepperoni. Great sauce great cheese wish I could give it a 4.5 it's not a 4 but it's not a 5 either. The fresh mozzarella slice is kinda basic sauce is different lil sweeter. The white is very good. Pepperoni was my favorite lots of sauce and cheese"
14-Aug-18,"This is the best pizza I have had in the United States. First of all, the gentlemen who helped me pick out the pizza and rang me up were very nice, and obviously used to staying cool under pressure (it can get very busy). The pizza itself is absolutely delicious, with amazingly crispy (but not burnt!) crust and flavorful sauce. It is a little on the pricey side for a slice but well worth it!"
13-Aug-18,I give it a 7.5! The hype was worth it. Do yourself a favor and avoid the Times Square location. Plain slice is the way to go.
12-Aug-18,"When you arrive in NYC, don't unpack. Go directly to Joe's to grab a slice. This is exactly what you are looking for. Not pretentious, just excellent NY style pizza from an institution."
12-Aug-18,"This is definitely the best ""NY"" pizza place around. Super cheap, only $3 a slice, and is super fresh and soooooo good! On our last day I wanted to have a typical slice of NY style pizza, and this did not disappoint. I'm sorry Chicago, but NY wins!The slices are huge, come out hot, and are the perfect combination of crispy, thin, greasy, and fresh. COME HERE, SERIOSULY"
11-Aug-18,"Within walking distance to almost everything so it's convenient. Lines move quick, Pizza is always fresh."
10-Aug-18,"Slow to move, long line out the door, but there's a reason for that. Though the pizza here isn't the cheapest, it is delicious. Small space for eating, but we didn't have any issue finding a seat. We also loved the decor with pictures of all the celebrities who have dropped by for a slice or two. Had a pepperoni and a mozzarella slice. I absolutely loved the sauce of this pizzas. That's what separated it from all the other ""okay"" pizzas I've had. So flavorful. That goes for the mozzarella slice as well which are oftentimes too tomato-y with not so great cheese, but they must have added the right spices and used better ingredients, because I really enjoyed it."
8-Aug-18,"This is the real deal as far as New York Pizza.  The crust is crispy enough that if you can pick up the end of the pie and eat from the other end with one hand.  It stands on its own.  The crust is also crunchy and dark underneath.   Most of their pizza is very thin crusted, however they do have one thick crust pizza.  All the pizza is made and  cooked ahead of time and they put your slice back in the oven when you order it.  There is much  turnover , so your slice is freshI got the fresh tomato, with basil and fresh mozzarella. It was light and tasty. It was so light I ate a second one. The prices range from $3.00 to $4.50, but well worth it .  Clearly you could get a slice for .99cents, but it's smaller and does not compare with Joe's"
7-Aug-18,"My boyfriend and I came to New York City for a wedding - I had never been prior to this trip, so naturally he wanted to give me the authentic New York pizza experience. Joe's Pizza was highly recommended by my NYC native friends, and it did not disappoint! We went to the Joe's Pizza on Broadway as we were staying in the Midtown area close to Times Square. I think this is the not the first location, which I believe has a more old-timey feel to it, but we didn't care where we got pizza, as long as we got it! Upon entering, it looks like any other old school pizza joint. We were there at 3 PM on a Friday and there was a decent-sized line almost out of the door...although the service is so quick since most people are getting pizza by the slice, so we were in line for 5 mins tops. We got pepperoni and cheese slices, which was delicious. Literally I have nothing bad to say about it - the pizza was excellent! There were other, more unique slice flavors, but we decided to stick to the basics. Regardless of what you get, you can't go wrong with Joe's Pizza. I will continue to come back every time we're in New York - already craving it just writing this review!"
6-Aug-18,"Awesome, quick operation with very reasonable prices.  Food - Cheese pizza was the perfect NY slice.  Perfect crisp on the outside of the crust, little chewy on the inside, sauce with a slight tang, perfect amount of cheese, maybe just a little little little bit too greasy but still great.  Spinach and ricotta pizza was a little watery BUT once I mopped it up a little it was one of the best slices i've ever had. Service - Super long line and they blew through it quick, awesome would definitely recommend, loved it"
5-Aug-18,"Good pizza for a good price.  Try the caprese pizza, with its thin crust made just right.  Not at all rubbery like Pizza Hut or Dominos.  This place did not get 5 stars as the counter staff was rude, similar to the Soup Nazi guy from Seinfeld."
4-Aug-18,"Long lines that moved quickly create a sense that the pizza you are about to consume is going to be great. I orders a slice of traditional cheese and supreme. Honestly the pizza was ok, nothing amazing or mind blowing. The tradition cheese was a bit chewy. Supreme had a nice flavor. Not sure the NYC pizza experience that I would repeat. Staff was friendly and worked hard."
4-Aug-18,The lines are out the door but thankfully it moves pretty quickly. The cheese pizza was good but the slice of caprese pizza was even better. It was a cheap filing meal.
3-Aug-18,"Exactly what I needed after dodging a bunch of little kids (some of which were my own) at Midtown Comics and Times Square. This pizza will put a smile on your face, improve your complexion, and make your children love you again. Lots of slices to select from, including some white. Great for a quick slice. Do it now."
2-Aug-18,"some good pizza is on broadway and it's called joe's pizza . yes it's filled with tourist and folks who work or hang in the area and yes 23 bucks for a large pie delivered without tip is high and yes the pictures of various celebrity types on the wall is gimmicky but the pizza is actually good .a few array of assorted slices are on display for your choosing or you can order a salad if you prefer . the eat in area is not too spacious with a few high round tables and against the wall counter seating that is usually filled . as for the pizza i would give it 4 stars overall for taste , size and freshness . just a note if you order a pie well done be prepared to eat a pie really well done . i can't say it's the best pizza in new york as sooooo many other pizza joints claim but it's up their with the others ."
2-Aug-18,Holy Moly!  I work near Joe's and I've taken many walks past it on Broadway.  I hadn't thought much about a pizza shop but one interesting thing to note is that every time I pass by I'd see a long line out the door.What's so special about this pizza shop?  I got to find out a few days back.  Very limited menu and a simple one.  I grabbed 2 plain slices and they were oh so worth the wait!  Light on the cheese and simply delish.  Price is your average price for a slice in NYC.Must visit!
1-Aug-18,"Holy Moly!!!! Their pizza is freaking delicious!After having some dancing in the rain kind of fun (cue Taylor Swift obsession) in the middle of Times Square, it hit us that we had about 20 min to have dinner before our next adventure across the bridge, so we were looking for something fast, cheap, and easy. We asked a couple people in the street where the best and closest pizza place was to us (when in NYC, right?) and bam, Joe's pizza was about two blocks away.The place was absolutely packed - people outside waiting in line kind of packed. But the line moved surprisingly quickly. We got to the counter in less than 5 min, and by the time we got to the register, our pizzas were ready. You've got pretty much all the classics and a few other topics to choose from. I'm a big fan of white pizza and a whole lot of spinach (so you can tell which one was mine) - but also, couldn't pass on the opportunity to try a good old fashioned pepperoni slice, for comparison purposes.. or something like that! Hahaha.Everything about their pizzas is incredible. Not too greasy, not dry, not overloading in cheese, just the right temperature, crunchy, but not falling apart crust, just all around everything your taste buds want and need in a slice of pizza.A must when in Times Square. Can't wait to go back!"
1-Aug-18,Great pizza. Classic NYC pizza. Thin but not annoyingly thin crust. Good ratio of cheese to sauce to pepperoni.
30-Jul-18,Best Pizza in New York.  Great quality food at reasonable prices and delicious.  Don't go anywhere else in the city for pizza except here.
29-Jul-18,Very good pie. Had both on location and delivery the next day. Caprese was a little light on the fresh mozzarella but very good.
26-Jul-18,You wouldn't think you would get great pizza in the middle of a tourist spot like Times Square but Joe's delivers on taste!  Very busy but the line moves quick and there plenty of places you can sit outside with your slice of deliciousness.  The bonus is that is that it's super cheap as well.
26-Jul-18,"Great NY style pizza! We ate at the restaurant and were lucky to get a table because of the limited city. However it's in the heart of NYC, so not much they can do about seating. Would go back again tomorrow if we lived there!"
25-Jul-18,"Stumbled upon this place on a Monday night because I noticed there was a long line so I figured it had to be good. Found out why, they're kinda famous. They were featured in the Tobey Maguire Spider Man movie and there are tons of pictures of celebrities who have been there. Got the Sicilian and my son got a plain cheese. I thought mine was ok, not great but my son really liked his. Would probably go back if in the Times Square area and recommend to anyone who loves pizza"
25-Jul-18,"This place never disappoints and it's super close to my apartment. I recently took my parents here when they visited and they enjoyed it! The wait always looks long (out the door) but shouldn't take longer than 15 minutes. The cheese is definitely the way to go. The bottom is crispy and the ratio of cheese and sauce is perfect. I also recommend the ricotta and pepperoni, but if you were only getting one slice, I would go for cheese.The place is also decorated with pictures of all the celebrities that went there, try to find your favorite!"
24-Jul-18,"Joe's makes the best pizza coast to coast......LITERALLY! We first tried their pizza in California on Sunset Boulevard and were surprised that CA actually had great pizza. Guiseppe told us about their NYC locations so we tried that as well and it didn't disappoint. We were concerned about the long line, but it moved quickly and efficiently. Can't wait to return!"
23-Jul-18,"My first time in NYC and saw this place and had to try a ""New York"" pizza. Turns out it's a popular place, lines were out the door and famous people with their pictures on the walls. We ordered a plain cheese, margherita, and a veggie. It was delicious!! $3 for a big slice is not bad either."
22-Jul-18,"You had one job. Deliver the 2 (TWO) items I ordered. Pizza and a drink. Forgot the drink, which I was charged for. Delivering to a hotel (which they knew) and no plates, no napkins, no seasonings. Seriously?"
20-Jul-18,"AMAZING!!!! I recommend this place 10000%  pizza is delicious. Right by Time Square, inexpensive, always busy but line moves very fast."
19-Jul-18,Very close to Times Square the pizza is SOOO GOOD. They also have frames all over the walls of all the famous people that have stopped in which is neat to look at while you're waiting in the long but rather quick line. I paid $5.50 for a slice of pizza and a drink so it's not too expensive either.
19-Jul-18,"A new favorite in NYC when it comes to quick eats in the city. My favorite thing about the slice is the thin and crispy crust and red sauce. Loved the fresh mozzarella, the caprese, and supreme pizza slices. A little pricey per slice."
19-Jul-18,"This is the best pizza place in New York the pizza has an amazing crunch. I am not really a big fan of pizza with too much cheese but Joe's was perfect if you are every in Manhattan looking for some cheap, fast and delicious pizza go to Joe's Pizza!                               I love Joe's pizza"
17-Jul-18,"I am not a new yorker! This might be the reason why I did not find this famous pizza extremely delicious. The pizza was good ! The place was packed, obviously people love it ! It's one of those places that you just need to try. To me the tomato sauce was a little too plane. We tried the Alfredo pizza and it was delish.  The slices are huge . Prices are good ."
17-Jul-18,"My friend and I are from upstate NY and we wanted a good slice of pizza so we came here.  It was a hot day. I ordered one slice of cheese and mmm it was so good. The staff was super friendly, even with it being so hot out and busy inside. I would definitely go back again"
16-Jul-18,"Late night pizza near Midtown. Lines aren't too crazy after 12 am. Grab a slice of cheese and make sure it's as hot as possible. Some pizzas have burnt bottoms. $3.50 for a cheese will always be a bit much, but I cannot say no. P.S. don't get the one with mozzarella circles on it."
16-Jul-18,"This was the first authentic NY pizza we tried during our trip. It was late and we were tired after riding the train to NY from DC.  While I had bookmarked a ton of places on Yelp ahead of our trip, we simply just wanted some pizza delivered to our room while we settled in. A quick Yelp search lead us to discover Joe's Pizza. We ordered through the app and it was delivered promptly, and most importantly fresh and hot. The pizza was delicious and hit all the right spots. The proportion of toppings, cheese and sauce was absolutely perfect!  The best part for me is I discovered broccoli as a pizza topping, something I've never tried before and now can't live without!  We also had pepperoni and sliced meatballs for toppings. While in NYC over five days we tried many pizza places and I have to say that Joe's came out on top for me. Although Kiss my Slice was also a top contender. I see they have many locations around the city and I highly recommend them!!"
15-Jul-18,"This is the first place I came to after arriving. I was staying with a friend who insisted that this place was NY's best. Honestly, I didn't really have high expectations because pizza is pizza, and how different could it be? I was so wrong. I don't even like thin crust, but the crust was so delicious. The slices are huge, but somehow not greasy?! Somehow, the pizza maintained its structural integrity HAHA even though the crust was so thin. If you aren't originally from NY and have yet to try the NY style pizza, do yourself a favor and come here!! It was so good, i had a slice everyday during my stay."
13-Jul-18,"This is everything a pizza should be.  Perfect sauce to cheese ratio and the crust has the perfect balance of chewiness and crunchiness.  The ingredients are very fresh resulting in a delicious slice.  I normally leave much of the crust over, but not with this pizza.  I know it sounds crazy, but I was in seventh heaven when I first tried a slice from Joe's.  Highly recommend if you're in the midtown west area."
13-Jul-18,"Not a fan of thin pizza. Ordered a slice of caprese, they reheated it before serving. You can see in the photo that they didn't skimp on cheese. Tomato was juicy."
12-Jul-18,"Joe's is everything you would want when you're craving a simple yet satisfying slice of NY style pizza. The crust is crunchy and the sauce is light and savory, always leaving you wanting more. My personal favorites here are the fresh mozzarella and the supreme. There are multiple locations around NY and it's so easy to just pop in and grab a quick bite to eat for a snack or for a meal. The last time I was here I came with the intention of eating a ""pre-dinner"" slice, but ended up ordering another because it was just too good. Definitely recommend Joe's for anyone in the area looking for a cheap and classic New York food experience."
12-Jul-18,"I didn't like it here, though my boyfriend loved it. What does that mean? IDK. They rush you to order even though you're 5-6 people away from paying. I understand fast service, but I'm so far down the line I'm not sure what I want. A lot of standing tables and bar seats available. Though every surface was dirty with crumbs and seasonings. Very crowded, better taking it togo."
10-Jul-18,Delicious authentic NY pizza! Not too greasy and doesn't make you feel too full or gross after eating a slice
10-Jul-18,"That was some really good Pizza! Line was out the door but we where served in under 15 minutes. Pizza was crisp, fresh and cheese was really good. We ordered a whole Pepperoni and a slice of deluxe. They where both good. A must try if you are in time square. Very limited seating inside but also seats outside on Broadway."
4-Jul-18,"Great pizza if you want a slice, the slices are huge!  Not many tables.  Fresh ingredients!  Take go!"
2-Jul-18,"Joe's pizza was really great after a long day walking around. Queue was out the door, so we figured it must be good! And it sure was! The queue moved quick. We got a Cheese Pizza ($21) & it took about 15mins, although we could see it sitting in the box on top of the oven for 5mins, not realising it was our order. But luckily it was still piping hot. Definitely worth trying!"
2-Jul-18,"99 cent pizza: fast, hot, and delicious.My friend's first NY pizza experience didn't go as planned: everything on Christmas was closed and this was the only place open! I know I'm posting this review late but I thought it was well-deserved. I have always been skeptical of 99 cent pizza but this place was the best! The pizza was steaming hot and tasty with regular topping options on the counters. The portion of each slice was pretty big and they didn't skimp out on the cheese. My friend even talked about the pizza from Joe's Pizza as one of the highlights from his trip to New York City! Thanks Joe's Pizza!"
1-Jul-18,"Extremely fast, affordable, and totally delicious! Many places in NYC have staff with a bit of a chip on the shoulder from all the tourists (understandably for some). Not Joe's, the guys were friendly and that slice was absolutely perfect after a day of walking around!"
1-Jul-18,"Want charred over cooked 9000 degrees greasy pizza..   this is your place.    I saw the guy take a fully cooked pizza, put the toppings on it. And then cook it or should I say burn it..       poor pizza."
1-Jul-18,"Visiting from Chicago, I was told I had to try Joe's pizza!  Very tasty New York style! Just love the history and waiting in line with such friendly patrons."
30-Jun-18,Awesome awesome awesome pizza! This was my first time trying a New York style pie and it was great! The pies are huge and covered in amazing tasting cheese. We added mushrooms and spinach to ours and it was delicious. Their sauce was also great not too tart and not too sweet. They also give plenty of toppings to cover the pizza unlike most other places that scatter the toppings far and wide. I'd recommend to anyone staying in the midtown area to try them out!
29-Jun-18,"I get pizza in NY about once every 15 years, so when I see over 4 stars on yelp I'm expecting to be blown away. It was very good, but I was nowhere near blown away. Sadface."
28-Jun-18,"YUM! We were in NYC for 7 days and I think we came here 3 times. The Pepperoni, the one with the big blobs of cheese, and Caprese are my favourite! These are some seriously good slices. Thin, slightly burnt crust, melty cheese, yummy tomato sauce. So simple. Amazing. I wish I could have tried all of them.The mushroom/truffle slice was not for me. I wouldn't have that one again. I had to pile on the hot pepper flakes to finish it.Quick service and sketchy looking/sounding staff, but the same guys were pretty friendly the second time we visited two days in a row!Joe's was the best slice we had in NYC. Definitely give them a try!"
28-Jun-18,"Joe's PizzaWhile in Manhattan we wanted to stop for authentic NY style pizza. Joe's was a quick stop as we walked to Times Square. It's very convenient if you want something quickly, without the full sit down experience.A famous spot and even seen in Spiderman, Joe's Pizza has a very small eating area, with a few small circular tables and a counter space that faces the front window.  Customers stand in a line that goes out the door, and place their order.Some customers call in orders or place full pizza orders at the counter, then wait off to the side. But most customers order slices that are taken from pre-made pizzas.  They add the toppings you want, then re-heat the slices in the oven. Hence, the speed and convenience. The slices are huge and come with a solid tomato base, and all the items that make pizza great.  You see many sitting in the windows, eating slices folded over. If this is your only shot at thin NY pizza, this is a very good place to get the experience, with no frills. Try it, you won't go away hungry."
28-Jun-18,"I am from out of town and was told that this was the place to go for pizza in New York. I will say it was pretty good. I got the white pizza, which I have loved to order recently. But, I don't think this was very similar to other white pizzas I've had. I don't feel the need to go back. Also very small and congested. Hard to tell where the line was."
27-Jun-18,"I ordered a whole pepperoni pizza since I am a pizza fiend but to my dismay, I regret getting the pepperoni. It was a bit overwhelmingly salty/greasy even though I love salty foods.The pizza dough was a little overcooked but it was still crispy and folds perfectly so that made up for it quite well. The sauce and cheese was on point as it didn't overwhelm my tastebuds.Next time I come try Joe's again I'll go without the meat and just get it with the sauce and cheese and see if that is more agreeable. The price is pretty good for the quality so it's something that you can't expect to be the best but know that it's worth its price point."
26-Jun-18,All you need to know: don't leave with only one slice. Get a whole freakin pizza. That's my only regret.
25-Jun-18,"We wanted to have the classic NY pizza (huge paper-thin inexpensive slices) and found Joe's near Times Square on broadway during our online search.It's a tiny place with just a couple of tables that does a thriving business.  There were quite a few photos of the owner with celebrities who had stopped in including Jimmy Fallon.  When we arrived their was a modest line of about 20 people but things move quickly.  Slices were about $3 each and quite large, but most people were getting two.  Order and pay at the counter-we took our to go.  They also sell bottled water and soft drinks, for two of us the bill was $18.The pizza certainly checked all the NYC pizza boxes -huge, thin, cheap slices served fast and hot.  Flavor-wise I find NY pizza a bit bland-especially the plain cheese variety so go with at least pepperoni for a bit more flavor.Bottom line-good, traditional NY pizza."
24-Jun-18,Top notch pizza. Open late. You won't be disappointed. Enough said. Great flavors. Great crust. The way it should be done
23-Jun-18,"Decent pizza, fast, friendly service, good value, $3 for two slices and a soda. But, the pie I experienced was closer to the slice you can get at Costco in Anywhere, USA. If you want a fast slice of pizza in NY, this is for you - but if you're looking for a slice of ""New York Pizza"" you might feel let down. For $3, it's probably worth the risk."
21-Jun-18,"I met my friend here the other night for a quick dinner.I ordered a regular slice and a Sicilian slice. I love Sicilian but the slice I had at Joe's was lousy. The dough was not fresh. It tasted like it had been previously baked and frozen and the sauce and cheese were later added later on. When Sicilian is done right it's awesome. However, IMO very few pizzeria's make a quality Sicilian pizza and unfortunately Joe's falls into this category.That said, the regular slice I had was very good and was a nice size.I was tempted to give Joe's three stars but I'm giving it four because the pizza was reasonably priced considering Joe's is in a busy and touristy area near Times Square. The service was also friendly.If you eat at Joe's stick with the regular slice."
21-Jun-18,"If you are looking for a quick, cheap bite to eat this is a great place. I ate here twice while visiting NYC last week. The pizza is good, but not great."
20-Jun-18,"GREAT pizza! Not much seating but when I visited, there was outdoor seating with many open tables for a public event. Employees were very kind and quick. I will for sure be back any time I'm hungry and just looking for a quick bite."
18-Jun-18,"They deserve all the hype they get! Pizza was the definition of perfection... It was just warm enough, toasty enough, fragrant and tasty enough. Nothing was overly done.We visited after seeing a show on Broadway, and our mistake was not ordering enough before we wandered off. I suppose we should look on the bright side and be happy that at least we had such great pizza in New York!"
17-Jun-18,"Bleecker Street pizza is my fav in NYC. This comes a close second. I had a slice of white with spinach. I thought the spinach would probably taste like a soggy mess, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was tasty. And the pizza was crisp."
16-Jun-18,"This was, no joke, the best pizza I've ever had. Highly recommend the white pizza, but you can't go wrong with any of them! The secret is the perfect, crispy crust. Also, the grandma slice is so FLUFFY! Great value. I will miss this place when I leave NY!"
14-Jun-18,"So, after a bunch of duds, I finally found the outstanding pizza people rave about in New York. Joe's is located right on Broadway. I didn't realize they shut down sections of Broadway to traffic for pedestrian use, what a great idea. Joe's sits in front of some tables with AstroTurf and you can get a couple great slices and interact with the city. Fabulous experience."
13-Jun-18,"Great place, product is fresh and hot; the staff is courteous and the prices are top notch. Not the least expensive slice, but you can definitely taste the difference. Regular cheese pizza is the way to go, although the pepperoni was good too. They have plenty of garlic powder, Parmesan Cheese and Red Pepper to add to the slice."
13-Jun-18,"Good price for the most part, but pizza was just ok. Thin and crispy turned to burnt at the outer edges."
9-Jun-18,"WORST GLUTEN FREE PIZZA EVER! The crust was gooey and chewy! I asked for a gf margarita and they gave me a mozzarella cheese pizza (JUST marinara & mozzarella) when I told them it's missing Basil,  they argued with me saying margarita does NOT come with basil. And told me I'd have to pay an extra $2 to add basil. So easy to say I will not EVER get gf or margarita pizza there ever again !"
8-Jun-18,Cheap pizza that is amazing!!  I got the margarita and it was some of the best I have had!!
8-Jun-18,"What NY pizza should be: Delicious pizza, in and out in less than two minutes, a few bucks a slice. Famous for a reason, will definitely be returning."
8-Jun-18,"Last night I had the pleasure of experiencing Joe's!  Wow.  It definitely lived up to the hype!!! So, today..  I decided I'm gonna take a slice home....  no.  A WHOLE PIE! I called and asked if they had anyway that to condense it to make it ""plane appropriate"" and easier to handle...   I didn't get the mans name unfortunately however he went out of his way to make it work! THANK YOU SIR!   Now I get to take a little bit of NYC home to St. Louis for my family!"
8-Jun-18,Just perfectly delicious right after a Broadway show...may even be better than Lombardi!
7-Jun-18,"Not a fan of the super thin pizza!! I went here because it was recommended on a website and known as ""one of the best"". My pizza was burned. The Sicilian was not good and was also burned. Maybe I went on the wrong night, but this is my least favorite pizza in NY. They are open pretty late, so that's a plus for them. I recommend Little Italy's or a 99 can't pizza spot!"
3-Jun-18,Went to New York for my boyfriends birthday. He wants to try New York pizza and Chicago pizza to see which he prefers. Joe's was the second pizza place that we tried. We both LOVED our slices.  Good pizza.
2-Jun-18,"Hands down best cheese pizza by the slice in the city!! Made the mistake of venturing out and trying the margarita pizza, don't waste your time, stick to the good ole plain cheese. Quick service, cool celeb pics on the wall. My wife and usually hit up this spot before we catch a broadway show. There's a $5 min or credit cards, but if you buy 2 cheese slices ($3 each) you're golden!  Don't miss this place! There's another Joe's by Union Square, but that one tends to be a bit busier. Enjoy the best cheese pizza by the slice nyc has to offer!!"
1-Jun-18,Good pizza but definitely much better when it's NOT delivered. Not as thin as I would have liked but totally worth it. Prices are fair considering this is Manhattan.
1-Jun-18,I love Joe's slices!  It's a must eat when in NYC for authentic taste.  I keep coming back for more!
31-May-18,"If you're visiting NYC and are looking for the best pizza by the slice THIS IS IT!!! Such delicious pizza, and the slices are nice and large. This pizza is always FRESH! Great choice, definitely try their pizza."
30-May-18,"This was the perfect end to a perfect day! Stopped on a whim after a Broadway show. Line stretching out onto the street was a harbinger of goodness and we weren't disappointed. Line moves quickly and be prepared to order when it's your turn - this is NY people! We got a piping hot slice of pepperoni and one supreme. Little in-shop seating is not a problem, we headed out to open seats on Times Square for people watching. Both slices of pizza were great - crispy crust, tangy sauce, right cheesy goodness and salty meaty balance. My mouth is watering (or is that crying?) just thinking about it. Not a $1 slice joint, but there's a reason - go for it!!"
29-May-18,"Joe, sorry for the late review. I glided in with my bff's daughter's Flat Stanley three weeks ago. Luckily, it wasn't too crowded since it was just before noon. I ordered two caprese slices. The slices were hot, tasty and crispy. Perfect. Flat Stanley enjoyed his slice, especially since I foot the bill. He's a cheap date. Next!!"
29-May-18,We had the best pizza slices here. The crust was crispy and well cooked. I would definitely recommend the place.
9-May-18,Great pizza. The location makes this place a little busy but the line wasn't bad when I was there. Seating was a little tricky but to be expected. I would definitely go back for Joe's Pizza.
9-May-18,This is probably the standard NY slice! It's essentially in Times Square so it is crowded so carry out is probably the best option!
7-May-18,"Not sure what all the hype is about this place. Pizza is ok, wouldn't write home about it. Typical thin crust that is overpriced for a slice with nothing that stands out from the rest. Only came here as there was a line just to get in so I decided to join the party. Would not come back as you can get the same quality any else in NY."
6-May-18,"First time in New York, authentic and amazing!!So many great choices, absolutely great prices!! Must visit!!"
5-May-18,"I mean, if you're going to have a ""NY pizza"" (not ironic quotes, I swear), this is probably the standard by which most others will be judged.  It was pretty amazing; well enough for us to order one in when we were just beat at the end of the day.Now, their lines are ridiculous (always out the door), but they move pretty quick, and generally have good service.  They could stand to add some more tables, but all in all, it's a good stop.  If you have about 15 minutes to kill, want a slice, and want the typical NY slice experience, it's the place to be.More detail: My wife and I split a slice of pepperoni after a show the first evening, and realized we should've each gotten our own.  The next night, we ordered a full pizza, and ate about 2/3 of it (half cheese, half pepperoni).  The price is a bit high for what you get (full pizza or slice), but you definitely won't be disappointed with the experience."
4-May-18,"That's some tasty pizza (pepperoni and sausage). The white pizza was a bit blah and dry, however."
2-May-18,"If I had had this pizza in SF I would definitely have given in 5 stars. But amidst NYC's plethora of pizza joints, Joe's was great but not my favorite.The crust was thin and chewy just the way I love with a super crispy edge. I could've done with a little more cheese on the caprese!It's a great deal though, just a few dollars for a huge, piping-hot, fresh slice. My favorite place though is still Roberta's."
30-Apr-18,Ate there 2x while in NYC.  Good slices with heavy sauce.  Great quick slice at a good price in NYC.
30-Apr-18,"After hearing about the hype of Joe's Pizza, I'd have to say I'm a tad bit disappointed.I got the mushroom pepperoni pizza. They warm up the pizza before giving it to you too, it was a warm enough to get the cheese nice and stringy. The mushrooms weren't dried out and still tasted fresh and the pepperoni was nice and crispy. It's a great pizza, a thin crispy dough with a crisp but chewy crust--they've got a solid dough recipe! However, I will say that I don't think a single slice of pizza was worth $4.75. As delicious as it was, I think many other pizza joints are comparable but at the classic NYC $1 price.I found the staff at the time a bit...annoyed? It felt like they were irritated or impatient when they talked to us,I was also a bit confused why none of the pizzas on display were labeled, so you wouldn't know what matched up with the menu. The ask you which pizza you wanted first before moving up to the counter, where they would ask which pizza you got. I just stood there listing the toppings because I didn't know what it would be called.Overall, the pizza was great but not $4.75 great. I would say to try it if it's convenient, but don't go out of your way for this pizza joint."
30-Apr-18,"Thank you for EXCELLENT pizza.  The crust is PERFECT, topped with just the right amount of sauce and toppings.  We NEEDED a great slice and got it at Joe's!"
29-Apr-18,"In my opinion, this pizza is the taste in my mind of what a NY style pizza is. The taste, the look, the place"
28-Apr-18,"This place was ok. I had the cheese slice. After a long night of bar hopping, it was the only pizza spot open in the wee hours of the morning in our area."
24-Apr-18,"Meh. My caprese was cold. I just didn't care for it considering pizza should be hot. The Sicilian was luke warm but my husbands pepperoni was piping hot. That was good. UPDATE: decided to give it another whirl before we left back home. Pizza was hot, fresh and good."
24-Apr-18,"HOT TAKE! This might be the best slice I have had in New York. It is a little more $$ than your typical $1 slice, but it's worth it. We got two pizzas, 1 Pepperoni/Mushroom, and 1 Cheese. The crust isn't too doughy or thin, and has the perfect amount of crunch. They definitely load up the toppings and it is PIPING hot when they serve it. If you're a big foodie or just in the area, I definitely recommend stopping by, wolfing down a slice of za, and then continuing on your (food) tour. The place itself is very small, so either grab a slice and eat at the counter, or if it's nice enough, just get it to go."
24-Apr-18,"The slices are amazing. It was crowded when we got there and long line. But the line moved quickly. The slice was crispy, non greasy and tasty. Must try."
23-Apr-18,"Tried  NY style pizza at different restaurants.   But, Joe's is by far the best in NYC you quickly will realize why many celebrities and people go here.  Quick delivery too ordered done delivered within 25min.  New NY pizza just get it here."
23-Apr-18,"This place is everything I wanted New York Pizza to be; thin, crispy, and cheesy. So good but make sure you give yourself time to eat because there is constantly a line out the door!"
17-Apr-18,These guys have one of the best pizzas in the city. Lunch line can be long at times but they get people in and out quickly. My personal favorite slice is the fresh mozzarella slice. It's nice and clean in. There's pictures of celebrities on the walls that have visited this pizzeria. It's a good place for a quick bit to eat before walking around the time square area. Would recommend and come by.
17-Apr-18,"Despite iffy reviews, I went ahead & ordered anyway. It's one of the later night pizza places & they delivered! It was really good & a fast delivery! Will definitely have to reorder! Thank you!"
16-Apr-18,"Everytime I visit NY, I NEED to go to Joe's Pizza!  It is simply the best pizza in NY!  There's no need to spend a crazy amount of money at larger/fancier places, come here!  Plus it's open late so it's a perfect place to grab a bit after a show finishes!"
16-Apr-18,"The pizza here is amazing! There is usually a line but it moves quickly. My favorite is the supreme slice with pepperoni, sausage, red onions. So tasty and cheesy. The plain is good also, especially when it is fresh hot out of the oven.There are standing edge outside to eat your pizza if the inside tables are filled. Also, across the street are public sidewalk tables and chairs, which you can go to sit and enjoy the pizza."
15-Apr-18,I had one slice each of cheese and mozzarella pizzas for my first visit at Joe's pizza and they were delicious! Definitely worth a visit and I enjoyed it a lot.
15-Apr-18,The pizza is decent but nothing special. I would say somewhat below NYC's average. A little overpriced at $3 per cheese slice. Has a few places to seat
13-Apr-18,"ordered take out during a snow storm, they delivered quickly to our hotel and the pizza was still hot. I would like to try them ""in person"" next time to get a good feel but overall what I was expecting for a NY pizza! Thin, a bit greasy (but not too much) and HUGE! We ordered two pizzas for 6 people and it was too much."
10-Apr-18,"The front desk guy at my hotel recommended this place to me, and I'm so glad he did. Thin crispy crust, sweet sauce, and a good amount of cheese. Went back again on my last day in the city because it was that good!"
10-Apr-18,"Needed a quick bite to eat before heading to a show and stumbled upon Joe's Pizza while walking up Broadway.  Nothing like NY style pizza to satisfy a craving!  The place is small with minimal seating, but has all of what you would expect in NYC.  The line moves quickly, the pizza was hot - I loved the sauce they use!  Remember to grab extra napkins...We enjoyed our pre-show pizza so much that after the show we ordered 2 pies to be delivered to our hotel room.  Teeir online estimate was 45 minutes, but we were enjoying piping hot pizza withing 20 minutes of placing the order!  Good stuff!"
10-Apr-18,"We came here after a night out and found it because it was open late. For being near Times Square and the convenience of being open late at night, it was solid. I wouldn't necessarily choose this pizza over other options, but it was pretty good and convenient."
10-Apr-18,"[Intro Disclaimer: As a Toronto foodie, I ventured out to New York for the first time in my life with high expectations and a fully planned itinerary dedicated towards trying all the best foods in New York City!]Joe's Pizza is famously known for its traditional simple pizza, with a very thin crispy crust and minimal toppings. It's gotten so much attention over the years that inside the store, the walls are plastered with photos taken of celebrities that have visited. There's seemingly always a line-up at any hour of the day and it's a fast-paced ""quick-eats"" kinda environment with minimal seating. Admittedly, this is the only eatery that I visited twice during my one week stay in New York simply due to convenience (we wanted something nearby, quick and available in a small portion). However, I personally thought it was just ""okay"". My boyfriend seemed to enjoy it more than me but he specified it was only for the pepperoni slice. I mean, I have nothing against the pizza here. I tried the Caprese slice as well as the White slice and they were both fine! I just wouldn't go as far as to say that it was my favourite slice of pizza ever or that I'd ever crave for it in particular. Would I be ecstatic to recommend it to friends? Not really. Would I come back if it were convenient? Sure..? Also, side note: I found it super confusing that they didn't have any labels whatsoever for their wide display of pizza. Considering they're located so close to Time Square and is a tourist trap location, I don't understand why they made it so difficult on themselves to have customers point at which pizza they want through the glass windows but then not really seeing where they pointed and then having to scream back and forth to confirm."
10-Apr-18,"For a $30 pizza, they should use fresh mushroom, but they use canned. Shame on them. Will never order this crap pizza again. So overhyped."
7-Apr-18,"Panties Dropped. This was a recommendation from someone I met when I moved to NYC and I finally had the chance to try it. $5 card minimum. A slice of cheese pizza is only $3. Great light lunch or snack if your touring NYC and need something to munch before a dinner or so. The first bite I ate it and understood why NYC pizza from mom and pops are to try. I sat there in the corner and have been the quietest I have been my whole life because I needed a moment to savor each bite. After that, I came back to life and was my happy self on with my errands for the day. A must try!"
4-Apr-18,"There's so many spectacular pizza places in NYC to try that it was painful to choose. However, we finally decided on Joe's Pizza because 1). read somewhere that this may be the most classic representation of ""New York Style"" pizza and 2). Pizza can be purchased by the slice here. Since there's only the two us (and a million other places to try in NYC), it didn't make sense to order a whole pie at a restaurant and not know what to do with the leftovers. Even though we had a fridge and oven at our residence, it seemed unlikely one would be heating up leftover pizza at any given meal. Joe's it was.We came around 6:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon and the place is not hard to find as the line was spilling out the front door. The place is small with limited seating and a bunch of people just standing around eating enjoying their pizza. Overall line moves very quickly as all the pizza slices are already made and they quickly reheat it in the oven for you. We ended up with one slice of Caprese to share. Total cost is $4.75, $5 minimum for credit card.The pizza came out steaming hot from the oven, and wow, it was such a simple slice of pizza, yet sooooo good. Caprese pizza is simply fresh slices of tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, some oil with no extra cheese on the crust. The crust was thin and very crunchy. I'm still amazed that such a simple pizza with no cheese (except slices of fresh mozzarella) on the crust could taste so good. The saying less is more definitely applies here. In fact, it was so good I contemplated jumping back in line to get us another flavor. But alas, there were still 3 other food destinations lined up for dinner, so farewell Joe's, it will have to be another time. I definitely would come back next time I'm in town. Highly recommend!"
3-Apr-18,"Had amazing New-York style pepperoni pizza with authentic thin crust, well seasoned sauce and perfectly sliced and quality pepperoni!"
3-Apr-18,"I'd like to start off this review by saying I am NOT a pizza kinda person! I'm more of a burger person. I almost didn't try this place out because I told my friend ""Eh, I don't need/want pizza right now."" But she reassured me I NEEDED to try this pizza!I must say, I'm sooo glad she convinced me to come here! I LOOOVED the pizza here!! Legit New York style pizza. You know it's legit when the walls are covered with pictures of celebrities eating here!This location is very convenient and easy to find, right on Broadway! When I came here at around 2 pm, the line was almost to the door but went by very quickly. Their pizza is also SUPER reasonable. $3 for cheese pizza and $0.50 for each additional topping. And these slices are HUGE! You definitely get your monies worth!I decided to try their Fresh Mozzarella Pizza, at $3.50 for a slice and no added tax, I thought this was a steal! It was definitely love at first bite for me! The crust was thin, which I LOVE, it was also super crispy, so crispy that I didn't need to do the NY pizza fold. It kept its shape the whole time I ate the slice. No sagging. They then put a generous amount of marinara sauce (again, LOVE) and lastly, put a generous amount of mozzarella cheese, which was definitely fresh. There were circular shaped pieces of mozzarella all over the slice. The slice was also very fresh! It was nice and hot like it just came out of the oven.They do have pizzas in the window to see what is available and I was expecting to get a slice of that pizza but I was pleasantly surprised when I was given a fresh slice from the back! I did need to wait a couple minutes for my slice, but I'm totally fine with that since I got a fresh slice. I'm not sure if that's protocol or if I just got lucky.Overall, I'm officially a fan of Joe's New York style pizza. This will be one of my first stops the next time I visit NYC!"
3-Apr-18,"Worth it. Line moves fast, & pizza was great. I'm glad i stopped in when i was in Times Square!"
2-Apr-18,Being in New York it's always great to know that the amazing pizza is right where you wanted to be in Times Square we all enjoy different slices and every single one was delicious
1-Apr-18,"I got a slice of cheese pizza and to my delight, it was the first slice from a pie fresh out of the oven! The pizza was thin, crispy, cheesy, and not too saucy--overall really good. The first bite of the tip is always the best. The restaurant was really crowded when my boyfriend I went (around peak dinner time I suppose) so there were no empty seats inside. Instead, we sat on the bench in front of the restaurant, and sadly our pizza got cold in due time. Nevertheless, this had nothing to do with the quality of Joe's Pizza, and I would definitely recommend it if you are craving a slice or want to escape the madness of Times Square for a while."
1-Apr-18,Very disappointed.  Heard great things so I had high expect  but the sauce has no flavor.  Taste like they forgot the garlic and seasonings
29-Mar-18,"Was visiting New York and it was around 3 am on a Saturday night, we were drunk and starving and we found this little gem. Hands down best pizza we've ever had. We wana come back just to have some more haha.Defiantly worth it!! Yum."
29-Mar-18,"We stopped by here for few slices as our quick dinner before heading back home after visiting the city for 2 days. great simple pizzeria place with fantastic sauce, I personally prefer my slices to have little less cheese. However, my husband and 2 boys really enjoyed their sausage and cheese slices. Glad we took the effort to stop by here as we were staying in UWS. Its not far from the Lincoln tunnel, so great bonus to have a quick escape home."
29-Mar-18,The addition of joe pizza is nice in the touristy area of Times Square. The pizza is definitely better quality than the 99cent pizza spot but I have had better slices elsewhere for the same price. Definitely try to get the NYC thin slice experience.
29-Mar-18,"It's fate that this place came about after we moved in a few blocks from this area. There are a couple other good pizza places around here, but for your basic pizza, I always come back to Joe's.People think this pizza that will change your life after eating it, but what makes Joe's pizza great is that it's simply a high quality, quick grab-and-go pizza place. This is the standard on what pizza should taste like."
27-Mar-18,"I came to this location because I was looking for the best pizza in midtown... and didn't even realize I went to the WV location last week. That being said, as I took a bite I was thinking 'this is the best pizza I have had in NYC', which is what I said about their WV location. No NYC flop, so cheesy, perfect crust, large size, by the slice, to go, DELICIOUS. This is your classic NYC pizza. If your in Times Square, don't even consider going anywhere else."
27-Mar-18,Not sure what all the fuss is about over here? It's good but it's not worth all the hype. I traveled from Vegas to get a good slice of NY pizza only to be disappointed. I realized I can actually find a better slice in Vegas.
26-Mar-18,"When the awning for Joe's Pizza went up shortly before the pizzeria's opening, my eyes glimmered with hope. ""Finally,"" I thought, ""a real New York pizzeria just a few steps from the office."" No chain, no 99-Cent stuff. Real New York Pizza. After stopping in multiple times since it opened a few months back, I'm pleased to say that Joe's Pizza lives up to the hype. At lunchtime, the line out the door can extend well past the shop next door but the line moves pretty quickly. Once you get in there, you're slapped in the face with the pizzeria's ""New Yorkness"" - photos of everyone and their grandmother on the walls, people packed shoulder to shoulder eating their lunch, etc. The pizza offerings are what you'd expect. My favorite slices are the regular, Sicilian, and white. The sauce is deliciously sweet and there's always the perfect amount of cheese. The one negative is that sometimes you get that burnt, ""this is what the floor of our oven tastes like"" flavor on a well-done piece of crust. Some people like this, but it's not for me. You may have to wait a bit - and it's a bit on the pricier side, but it's certainly better pizza than the 99 Cent joint around the block (that's solid too if you're into that). I'll be coming here for a long time."
26-Mar-18,Soooooooo tasty and fresh! The crust is amazing and the lines moves fast. Prices are cheap. Pizza was exactly what I would picture a NY pizza to taste like. Very limited seating but people eat fast. Lots of celebrity photos on the walls. Awesome place to try!
25-Mar-18,It was just ai-ight.  Way too expensive at $4.00 per slice of pepperoni pizza.  And the pizzas weren't made with care or love or anything special.  I won't be going back.
25-Mar-18,"Great NY style pizza! I had the supreme pizza and it was soo good. Loved the mushrooms. Great location and open til late. Line can get long pretty fast, but they do a good job to try to get your order to you fast."
24-Mar-18,This place is a quick go to place for pizza near Times Square. White pizza ricotta cheese was still cold. Fresh mozzarella pizza didn't have enough cheese in my opinion. The crust was nice and crispy and also had good flavor. Overall I really enjoyed Joe's pizza
21-Mar-18,Super busy joint. Pizza looks so delicious and tastes great! But we all left with a weird stomach ache. $4 for a slice pepperoni. $3 for cheese. Pretty thin pizza
20-Mar-18,"Naturally, my first meal after landing in New York had to be pizza. Conveniently, this Joe's pizza location is right next to Times Square so I could visit both sites at the same time. It was about 8 pm, and the restaurant was full, though the line was only 3 or 4 people long. Their sliced range from $3 to $5 -- my pepperoni slice was $4 and was about as big as the paper plate it was served on. I was glad to see that they didn't just take a slice from the display case and serve it to me; they actually put it back in the oven to toast up the crust and melt the cheese a little bit more. SO GOOD. The crust was so crispy, and not soggy at all, which impressed me, especially considering how large and greasy the slice was. I really enjoyed that aspect of it!! The rest of the pizza was just okay. The pepperoni wasn't really flavorful, and the cheese didn't feel that special. Overall, Joe's is really popular and I can see why. The pizza is cheap, quick, and tasty. While I may not have been blown away, the pizza is definitely good and definitely satisfies any pizza craving. Either way, it's worth coming to try and decide for yourself!!"
19-Mar-18,"Fantastic NY style pizza! This was cheap, fast, and tasty. The location on Broadway looked busy, but the line goes fast. The pizza is thin, crispy, and packed full of flavor. We just got the cheese which was $3/slice. There are no bathrooms that we saw and not much space for seating, but people cycle through pretty quick and we were able to grab a seat before we were finished. Wish we grabbed more pizza while we were here!"
17-Mar-18,"I am not a pizza fan. However, I couldn't go to NYC for the first time and not get a slice. Joe's came highly recommended. It was phenomenal! Fresh chunks of real mozzarella, many varieties. Excellent customer service and convenient location. IncNt wait to go back"
16-Mar-18,"This was the first stop we made as soon as we landed, got on the bus, dropped off our luggage and took the subway to Times Square.  We didn't even realize how popular this place was, but we were on the hunt for NY pizza and this place just happened to appear right in front of us!  It was pretty crowded and a long line was forming.  I quickly got in line and ordered two slices of pizza, one for my daughter and one for myself.  DELICIOUS!  I quickly found myself in line once again.  The pizza was perfect...great flavor, perfect combination of thin and crispy crust and oh so fresh!  Rating it 4 stars only because the second slice of pizza we both got was not as enjoyable.  I think they left it in the oven a little too long as the crust bottom was burnt...like, black burnt (they reheat the slices).  At this point the line was so long we just ate it and were on our way.  This wouldn't keep us from going back.  We both agreed that the very first slices we got from there were the best we had all week long in NYC!"
16-Mar-18,It took almost 2 hours to get my pizza. When it was delivered it was COLD. Upon ordering my confirmation was 45 min wait. 2 hours was not acceptable. I called the store and all they could tell me was it was out for delivery. I WILL NOT be ordering from Joe's Pizza. In a city this big - I'm sure I won't have any problems finding a better pizza delivery. I can't really comment on the pizza as it was cold and not good.
14-Mar-18,"Joe's has several locations in New York. This review is for the location on Broadway near Times Square. Like most counter-served places in NY, seating was limited and it's understood that you eat quickly and get out to make way for the customers after you. No talking and loitering here. There are two small tables and some counter space. Maybe fits 15 or so people max.This was my first bite of food getting off the plane. Comparing to several other slice shops in NYC that I tried, I would say Joe's Pizza has the best crust and to me exemplifies the quintessential NY pizza. Super thin crust (so you have to do the NY pizza fold or it will flop). Crust is crispy and just barely charred on the outside. Moist soft bread in the inside. The pizza was reheated in less than a minute and came out steaming hot. Of course, the cheese was stretchy as it should be. I got the pepperoni as well as the caprese. Even though I usually eat pizza with meat on it, I appreciate a good veggie pizza once in while and the caprese impressed me. It had a generous amount of tomato slices on it and good flavor from the sauce and basil. Most slices run about $4 but they are huge so I didn't mind. They don't do anything too fancy in the way of flavors and toppings. They keep it simple but what they do, they do well."
10-Mar-18,"Super quick and cheap meal in NYC, but still delicious! The pizza crust has soo much flavor and the tomato sauce is not too heavy. A slice is only $2.75 and definitely worth the price. Definitely reccomend."
9-Mar-18,A NY classic. Grab a slice and take in the experience. Standing room mostly and few spots to sit but that's all part of the magic. Different styles let you sample some yummy pies while looking at the C-Lebs that have popped in from Hollywood and whose pictures adorn the walls. Love this place and close to local theatre for a bite after a good show. Super tasty and worth the trip.
6-Mar-18,"Good price, tasty pizza, authentic NYC - it was everything that was promised. Though they don't promise seating, so don't count on that. There are a few tables and chairs, but the spot is so popular that they are almost always filled. That said, it's a quick stop, so it would be great if you're looking for somewhere to pop in to grab some food on the go."
5-Mar-18,Would have been better if the bottom was not totally burnt.  Fast delivery and scrapping off the topping was good
4-Mar-18,"I honestly came here because I had bookmarked it ever since seeing that Kim Kardashian loves this place.. Haha. Well I can see why! I went with the original pepperoni pizza. I think a slice was about $3.50? Definitely pricier than the other million places in New York. I really liked the dough of the pizza. It was just the right amount of thickness to my liking. It wasn't too oily, and not too salty. It was such a big slice of pizza so it got cold real fast since I was eating it outside at night. I would definitely want to come back to try the other specialty pizzas whenever I come back and visit NY!"
4-Mar-18,"Yumm yummm yummmy.  I've grown up on NYC pizza and this place nails what New York pizza is all about.   It's up there with prince street pizza, Lombardi's, Grimaldi's and L&Bs.   Yes I know the list of awesome NYC pizzerias goes on :))) This place is defiantly a hit with the after hours crowd and the celebrity crowd as seen by all the celebrities pics on the wall chowing down their favorite slice :)))"
3-Mar-18,"If it's cliche to love Joe's I don't want to be right! I treck my ass to Carmine street rain, sleet or snow everytime I'm in NYC and I don't even mind being stood on by the person next to me to fit in line. I like to sit in the park outside and instagram my slices before regretably eating them cold and hating myself for being a millenial!"
2-Mar-18,Great thin crust pizza. Crust was crispy just how I like it. Line was out the door and I can see why!
26-Feb-18,"I'm in the minority here and just really don't get the hype. The crust was burned and too crispy. The overall pizza (I had a slice of the regular cheese) was just meh. The good part is that they move the line quickly, so despite a super long line, we weren't waiting more than a few minutes and was able to find a place to sit. Other than that, it just wasn't that great and I probably won't be back."
24-Feb-18,"totally lived up to the hype.  It is SO good, yet totally simple.  And we know pizza - we're picky and we spent 6 years in New Haven.  So glad we gave it a try."
19-Feb-18,This place was packed. And it deserved to be. It was exactly what we wanted in slices of New York pizza. We loved the cheese pizza and the white with spinach best. You can't go wrong.
17-Feb-18,"We have been loyalists to John's Pizza for 2 decades.   Enough of this Joe versus John debate.  We had to come her to sample for ourselves.  We had to come here twice because you know, you need to verify.  8 slices later, this is our go-to spot when we don't feel like waiting for John's.  Fast, yummy and cheap.  ps if your younger one eats 1.5 slices at John's, you may need to buy her a full slice because she won't share."
17-Feb-18,"Joe's was good. I didn't know much about the history of it before going so it was a cool experience but not the best pizza I've had in the city. Place was SLAMMED on a Friday around 2 pm, probably 30 people in line. Not many places to sit. Great staff, good prices."
15-Feb-18,"Best pizza in the city, good prices huge slices. The taste is very good, thin bottom with a big crust. Great place to eat when in the area"
15-Feb-18,"Quality had gone down the past months with burnt crust, and I mean black bitter crust, burned overcooked sold to tourists and customers. My complaint of the burnt crust was ridiculed and assured that it was edible. I'm a New Yorker and I know pizza. They are not to get away with this."
15-Feb-18,"This was the first bite of food I had once I landed in New York. It did not disappoint.We were on our way to Times Square (yes, to do the touristy things one does when in NY). There was a Joe's nearby.  My sister and I decided to share a slice of cheese because we wanted to eat at other places. They heat up the slice for you... hot pizza cannot taste bad... i think that's scientifically proven.. jk its not.The slice defines NY pizza. Thin, stretchy cheese, perfect tomato sauce... all for 3 bucks. Miss this place..."
15-Feb-18,Great pizza and nice people working here. Always friendly and quick service. I've tried most of the slices and have never been disappointed. One time I was accidentally overcharged and they gave me a full refund as well as my pizza on the house.
14-Feb-18,"Perfectly crispy, thin crust where the dough is still chewy and not too thin like crackers. The pepperoni pizza was perfect that I had to get a second slice. Price wise it is a tad more expensive than other popular joints."
12-Feb-18,First visit to NY and stopped in to grab a slice for dinner. The staff was very friendly even though it was very busy. I got a slice of the chicken bacon ranch and it was AMAZING! Love this place and can't wait to go back!
11-Feb-18,I give venues 5 starts when they deliver exactly what they promote and sell. If you love pizza come here and get two cheese slices. End of story. Probably my favorite slice in town.
11-Feb-18,"One of my favorite margarita slices in the city. If you like thin crust, you will LOVE Joe's. Another fan favorite was the ricotta slice. It's hard to find a seat but you'll enjoy the pizza either way!"
10-Feb-18,"Best pizza ever! Definitely will not disappointment. Came here the first night we landed, we got to the restaurant around midnight. It was pretty packed for the time it was. They were fast and got our pizza out to us in about 15 minutes. Customer service and food were both great! We will definitely come back here when we go to New York again."
9-Feb-18,"A NY Pizza joint that is really good!!!  Tasty slices of pie, I must say.  Seating can be pretty tough, but going here for a nice NY style pizza is legit!  Big size slices, price is alright and tasty!  What more would you want for a New Yorker? Yeah, the space is small, but isn't every place is NY?  Drop by if you can!  Not too shabby."
9-Feb-18,I had just recently order Joe's pizza for delivery it was 27 for a two topping. I got the pepperoni and sausage and it was rather good but not the best pizza I've had. The crust was a bit crispy and got a good crunch. I would probably next time just grab a slice instead of a full one.
8-Feb-18,"Wow. Just wow. THIS PLACE! The walls covered in pictures of all sorts of celebrities that have visited shows how loved this place is! Probably one of the best pizzas in the city. We got a margarita pizza and white pizza as a late night meal. Both were fantastic! Crust is thin and crispy with just the right amount of toppings. Don't be fooled by the appearance - it is a disaster...definitely a no frills pizza place. There were dirty napkins on the floor, tables were dirty, unclean floors, etc. They are so busy churning out pizza in the kitchen that they seem to ignore the store front. There aren't many tables at all, so I'd suggest grabbing a box and eating on a bench nearby to people watch in Times Square."
6-Feb-18,Love that Joe's opened up a spot uptown. This is my #1 pizza choice from when they had the corner spot on carmine and the lines were around the corner at 3 AM (good memories). I found it a bit odd that they did not include a restroom in there and the idea is to grab and get out...or just eat and run. Pizza is awesome though and I am just slightly ashamed that I ate three slices. In my defense they were just plain slices :) will definitely come back now that I know they are nearby.
4-Feb-18,"This is the best slice I have ever had! I'm definitely coming back before my nyc trip is over to eat more cheese pizza! Quick, simple, and perfect"
2-Feb-18,"I've been to MANY pizza spots in nyc, but I haven't been to many with better pizza than Joe's. This is now may favorite spot. Stopped in around 10 P.M. on Christmas Eve and there was a line out the door to get this amazing pie. The staff was very friendly and got everyone their orders surprisingly quick. Next time I'm in town, I will probably eat here at least once per day!"
2-Feb-18,"3$ for a regular cheese slice and 4$ for one topping slice.Got the regular cheese slice and it was delicious. Perfect amount of cheese and tomato sauce.One thing I didn't like was that when I was waiting to pay for my slice; one of the cashier skipped my turn. Idk if it was because I am Asian or because I am short (I am 4'11) and decide not to acknowledge me. Like booboo you don't skip me just because of my appearance. But yeah, that kind of turn me off and he didn't even apologize for skipping me after I hand him the money."
1-Feb-18,"Don't be fooled by this little shop that may seem over-hyped or too chain-like. I thought that they offered delicious, simple slices and I love that they have so many locations throughout the city.Out of all the pizzas I had in NY (ranging from fancy to touristy to street), this place had the best tasting pizza for the price. I tried their cheese pizza slice for $3 and it had the perfect crispy, thin crust with a good sauce to cheese ratio.It was so good that we went back to this place for pizza multiple times!"
31-Jan-18,"Maybe it was over hyped for me. It was okay. It was also our last day in New York so I was expecting some amazing pizza after all the food we had through the week! It still had everything you are looking for in a pizza, a classic pizza. It just didn't hit the spot when I had it. I am defiantly going to give it another try next time I'm in town!"
28-Jan-18,"If you have heard of New york's delicious pizza, then they must be talking about the pizza from this place. Quick, well seved and Quality. One of the best pizza slices, I've ever had... Artichoke pizza(east village) is another one."
28-Jan-18,Best. Pizza. Ever. Super simple red sauce (the white pizza is also amazing). The perfect thin crust. No bells and whistles. Fast service. I typically get one slice of cheese and one slice of white. Phenomenal. Skip the Sicilian. Too doughy unless you like thick crust.The original Greenwich Village location is my favorite. You might even run into a celebrity once in a while.Skip delivery and just go there in person. 50% of the time it gets delivered mangled and cold.
28-Jan-18,"Pizza is sooooo delicious, fast delivery, no delivery fee and when I lost my receipt they were patient and were able to send me a picture of it. Thank you!!"
25-Jan-18,My Favorite place to eat pizza. I can't believe their pizza is so simple but packed with so much flavor. I really recommend this place to anybody looking for A GREAT SLICE OF PIZZA!!!
21-Jan-18,Great spot! Fresh mozzarella pizza is out of this world! I recommend 100%. You will not regret visiting.
21-Jan-18,Great pizza. Fast service. Price is good. Loved the decor with all of the pictures and quotes from celebrities who had eaten at Joes.
21-Jan-18,"I wanted to love this pizza, but felt it was pretty average in comparison to the pizza I've tried in San Francisco/greater Bay Area. While it was definitely hot, inexpensive, and a great late night bite- it wouldn't be high on my list of places to head back to in NYC. Personally tried the Sicilian slice, so maybe the other slices are better. Was fun looking at their celebrity fan pictures on the wall though. Bring cash!"
18-Jan-18,"Joe's Pizza is located just 2 short blocks from Times Square on Broadway. The surprisingly spacious pizzeria is mainly a slice shop with two tables and two large counters with stools facing the street. Prices start at $3 for a plain slice and $4 for any one-topping slice. It's just slightly more for a Sicilian slice. A cup soda is a very affordable $1.50. Service is very quick here, and if you're ordering from the counter, you might need to get your slices re-heated which didn't take long.  As for the pizza itself, what I like about Joe's and is a bit unique is that their crusts are flaky, almost like a croissant-type flaky crust with a yeasty and doughy inside. The dough where the marinara and cheese sit on, is very thin and has a nice texture. As for toppings, cheese is typical mozzarella. I also had pepperoni which is reliably classic New York pepperoni, nothing fancy, but gives you what you expect. Finally, I like the fact that their prices seem reasonable, especially in a heavily touristed district like Times Square."
18-Jan-18,"It is an ordinary pizza parlor that become famous because of its attraction sign- Spiderman was here! Who wouldn't  want to eat a NY style slice of pizza (fairly priced) inside a pizzeria were many celebrities visited? Line is  long but moved very quickly. We were served in less than 15 minutes. The hard part was waiting for a table and chairs to be free up from other guests that were there before us.The pizza is average in taste but my visiting family from Las Vegas and Texas enjoyed the thin crust  NY's pizza known for,  with a background in their selfies some photos taken by the management of the celebs was fantastic as bring tourists. Location is 2 blocks away from the heart of Times Square- with an easy sit down access pizzeria."
13-Jan-18,Good thin crust pizza. The sauce is good but on the sweet side. The cheese is fresh.  Overall this is a great ny style pizza! The slices are big and filling..
13-Jan-18,"They were packed on a sat. Night. The cashier still had time to joke around and banter, my pizza was lightning fast done, and it was really good! Can't beat the price! It was cool seeing all the celebrities on the wall. I'm glad I stopped in."
12-Jan-18,"This is a pretty average pizza... I feel like it's overhyped from all of the celebrities and it's appearance in Spider-Man. Environment: I went to the one close to time square so it was very nice to eat after seeing the iconic land mark. It was super easy to spot! Very cool to see all of the pictures of the celebrities who stop by. Service: it was fast and there were no lines when we went. Everyone is very efficient and the workers were all joking around. Very friendly place. Food: we got the pizza with sausage on it. It was ok. The crust was crunchy, but it got soggy after a bit. It would hold up on its own though! It's pretty pricey especially when there's a 99 cent pizza place a block down. Overall it's pretty average. Nothing really special about it, but it is nice to come try it out while you're in NYC for the first time!"
11-Jan-18,Loved that the crust was crunchy and could be folded and eaten like real New York pizza.  Had mushroom and spinach.  Hubby had plain pepperoni.  I loved it.  But crunchy crust is my fav
10-Jan-18,"I work for a family owned pizza restaurant back home and I was really looking forward to trying New York style pizza since I am from Chicago.  The service was great.  They delivered earlier than expected and it was easy to order but the food was okay.  It was better than a frozen pizza but definitely not worth $25.  The sauce was very sweet, the mushrooms were canned,  and there was no flavor/seasoning.  I usually do not leave reviews but this pizza was not worth the price!!  Go to Patzeria's! It was a lot better!"
25-Dec-17,"Can't come to New York and not try pizza. We were actually looking for the $.99 pizza, but so glad we stopped by Joe's instead. Never heard of this place, but it seems to be pretty popular with both tourists and locals, as well as celebrities. There wasn't much of a line when we got there, but it kept growing and growing as the night progressed.We weren't super hungry, so we got one slice of the white pizza with spinach to share. The pizza was already sitting out, but the staff was nice enough to reheat it up for us. I'm not a huge pizza person, but after the first bite, I knew this was something special. The crust was perfect and not overly thin. The cheese and garlic spinach was a nontraditional choice for toppings, but felt right for this occasion. For $5 a slice, not the cheapest around but definitely worth it."
24-Dec-17,"Not the best, but it's a good stop for late late night when everything is closed. Tried the pepperoni and mozzarella. It's a by the slice place to keep you moving. It's a small place so be ready to eat outside incase all the seats are taken."
24-Dec-17,Had some friends come visit and they wanted good pizza....this is gooodddd pizza!! You won't regret coming here. Be prepared to be amazed.
22-Dec-17,We were visiting from Texas and in search of some good pizza.  Went on yelp and came across this place.  Wow!  Pizza was pretty freaking good.  It was so good we went back a second time.  Prices are cheap.  Seating was limited but never had an issue finding a spot as so many are people coming in and out.  Place was clean and staff was nice.
22-Dec-17,"Delicious!We had a large party (5 adults and 5 kids) so seating was tight- we just split into smaller groups. It was totally worth it. Both cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza were devoured. The crust was just right, the sauce and proportion of cheese was perfect. So good!"
22-Dec-17,They deliver fast hot pizzas. And it's great. Sometimes the sauce taste a bit sweeter than other times but it's not overpowering. Some think this is the best in the city. It's in my best top 4. Bonus - the house salad is big and the dressing taste good. A strange thing  to judge a pizza place by but key.
22-Dec-17,"Delicious New York Style Pizza!  Famous and iconic pizza place, a casual atmosphere,  & a good place to grab late night dinner dinner."
21-Dec-17,WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. Waited over an hour for my order. Had to call twice to confirm order was being delivered. Order was cancelled and no refund given due to the online ordering system through third party. Almost $40 of pizza.
21-Dec-17,"God I love Pizza; especially this pizza. We went to get a slice last night and left with much more than a slice. Before we leave NYC, we already decided we're going to order a pie to take on the train with us. Want a simple slice of cheese? It's the place to go. Spice it up with a fancier piece? Their selection is wide and almost always available. Go to Joe's."
21-Dec-17,Good for a quick bite to eat or a snack! Slices are big and you can get two for around $8.
9-Dec-17,"Great pizza Great service Great experience From the moment we walked in we were greeted and helped promptly. The pizza is true New York style and delicious.  If you're in the city, you have to stop by and grab a slice from this famous pizza joint."
8-Dec-17,"Makes me so sad that I didn't like this place. I felt that the reviews definitely hyped it up too much for me. When I finally made my way to trying this place, I was sorely disappointed. The good - it wasn't THAT crowded. In fact, most people are fast with their orders (suprising since I figured it was in a touristy area, in fact I was the slow one!). Most people also take it to go. Hubby and I were able to find seats without having to wait. The bad - we got two slices: the one with everything on it, and the one with just some splotches of cheese on top of a regular cheese pizza (I believe this was the fresh mozzarella slice). The fresh mozzarella was not that flavorful - in fact I felt the sauce was too too sweet. The other slice was better, but nothing great, definitely nothing like what the reviews make these pizza slices sound. My mozzarella slice was burnt too so it was just like eating overly sweet sauce with cardboard burnt crust. SAD. It was a sad sad meal. Probably would have been happier eating a 1$ slice pizza. :("
8-Dec-17,"Holy moly! That is a fantastic slice of pizza!!!!! Perfectly thin and slightly charred crust.... tomato sauce that's neither too sweet nor too acidic..... and plenty of mozzarella. It's the perfect NY slice! Lotsa choices of toppings..... but it's plain cheese or white (with olive oil, mozzarella, dollops of ricotta, and lots of fresh garlic) for me. Just perfect!"
6-Dec-17,"Went on a Friday night & it was very busy, but the service was very fast. Seating is a bit limited but we were able to get a table. The pizza was as delicious as everyone described in the reviews. Even our pickiest eater loved it. I highly recommend this place!!"
5-Dec-17,Food: 3.5/5.0Service: 2.5/5.0Value: 3.5/5.0Decor: 2.5/5.0Overall: 3.5/5.0 Joe's is always a good spot to get a NY slice.  They should keep opening locations around the city.
5-Dec-17,"The best pizza I have ever eaten! Simple and delicious! Crispy crust, perfect flavor, texture, and only $3 a giant slice."
3-Dec-17,Delicious pizza! The crust is awesome and crisp! The plain cheese pizza is a way to go. Definitely coming back.
1-Dec-17,Fast pizza always ready and delicious. They heat it up for half a minute when you order to get extra crispy crust.
29-Nov-17,Had one white slice and one grandma slice. Both were great ny style thin crust pizza slices. The grandma slice had a slight sweetness to the sauce which I like. If you're in the midtown area you will not be disappointed with stopping here for a slice or two.
26-Nov-17,this is quintessential NY by the slice pizza! We split the cheese and my 4 year old daughter was going nuts. Friendly service to freshly heat the slices and walking the streets sharing a slice as a family was heaven to me.
26-Nov-17,"This is seriously the best pizza I've ever eaten in my life!!! Ever since watching a episode of Keeping up with the Kardashian where Kim insisted on going to Joe's pizza when she was in NYC, I thought, maybe I should go check it out since our hotel was 2 blocks away. I am so glad I did. I ordered a slice of Deluxe with pepperoni, red onions and mushrooms. The dough was perfect, not too thick or thin. The sauce was tasty, toppings was fresh, it was heavenly. You need to check it out if you are ever in town."
23-Nov-17,Excellent pizza. Many different pizza options. Line moved very fast and the staff was very friendly and prompt. The pizza was very crisp and nice and warm when served. If you are looking for a good slice of pizza quick this is your place. The indoor seating is very limited so if you are looking to dine in it may be full depending on day and time.
22-Nov-17,"Super tasty outpost of a classic! I usually go to location in Lower Manhattan, but the pizza here is great too. Ran here first thing after my late arrival at JFK for a quite bite. Never a disappointment!"
22-Nov-17,"My family and I absolutely love Joes! One of our favorite pizza places in NY. Service is fast, and the food is always great! Very good prices as well! Go to Joes, it will not disappoint you!!"
20-Nov-17,Terrific pizza by the slice! When in NYC u gotta have a slice of cheese pizza. Joe's does a great thin crust slice with a delicious tomato sauce!
18-Nov-17,"Joe's is the Pizza God.After 21 years of eating the slices at the original shop, I can report after having my first two slices here at their Broadway outpost that it lives up to the same level of quality.  Joe's is the icon of NYC pizza.  The ambassador to all visitors to NYC who taste it of what old school New York Pizza is all about."
18-Nov-17,"My girls and I decided to adventure out of Queens and head over to Joe's. Checked out the  fabulous reviews on Yelp before making our trek. Needless to say, we were not disappointed. The flavor of the sauce is what gets it. The pizza was good. A little greasy but not too bad and also expected. The place was busy but it was a Friday night. And the new guy they had on the register probably needed a little more training, but he was very friendly. If I happen to be in the area again, I will stop by."
18-Nov-17,"Out of all the pizza I've had in Manhattan so far, Joe's makes it to the top of the list. How they do this is beyond me, but the crust is thin and perfectly crispy. Each slice has just the right amount of sauce (not at all overwhelming) and the cheese is melty, stringy, and delicious. The pizza at Joe's is exactly what I imagined New York pizza to be. There might be a line out the door (for a good reason!), but the line goes by quickly, so don't be discouraged! Definitely worth a try!"
17-Nov-17,"Good New York pizza. Got some deliver from them and enjoyed it. Just the right amount of char on the crust. Decent sized slice that you have to fold. Toppings were good, I got pepperoni and black olive. The pizza was also good cold the next day, which is a great bonus. Delivery was quick. Pretty good overall. Would eat again."
16-Nov-17,It's all about preferences. I'm a fan of super thin pizzas with quality toppings and slightly burnt on the bottom. Joe's Pizza isn't a cheap piece of bread with nothing on it. So if that's your thing go to a national corporation. It's a pizza that after you eat you don't feel like a terrible person. Even the grease that comes off the pepperoni pizza is a thin layer. It's just so funny to read the lower ratings... It get's a four because of the price. 4 bucks for one topping slice is a little too much.
16-Nov-17,MMMMM. Close to Times Square. I guess they were in a Spiderman movie or something. Fast service despite the line. Hot and yummy cheese pizza. Some indoor seating. Inexpensive slices.
15-Nov-17,"Joe's pizza really helped me get through this day. The Sicilian pizza was amazing. Perfect combination of sauce and Cheese. It was fluffy and also crispy in the same bite.My office ordered 8 different pizzas and an antipasto at 11am and got it all by 12:15 which was right on time. There weren't a lot of leftovers, so it's safe to assume everyone in the office liked it"
14-Nov-17,"When in New York, do as the New Yorkers and eat Joe's Pizza. Not to be cheesy;)The gentleman at the broadway location was sweet enough to resend my order even though I totally got the delivery address wrong. Great service and of course the best pizza in town really made my day!Thank you mystery man!!"
13-Nov-17,I threw out the slice I bought. It was pepperoni. They use the big and flat ones which are greasy and lacking a really good meaty/spicy taste. The sauce has an oddly sweet vitamin/sweetener aftertaste as well. Bottom was pretty burned too. Won't go back. We deserve a better quality slice for the price.
11-Nov-17,"Bumped into Joe's because i was in Times Sq and it was getting late and i was starving like a maniac. Saw the bright light coming from this place and i was like ""ah the heck i'm gonna go in and grab a slice"". And i did not regret it.Yes $3 seems like a steep price tag to pay for a slice of cheese pizza but it's better than the dollar pizza nearby. It was not greasy and oily and the flavor was well balanced. I know it is sorta hard to adjust especially if you are used to the thicker slice one.they have plenty of other selections but of course it is much more expensive than the cheese slice. I'll def go back to try the mozzarella and sicilian slice. Funny enough that when my bus passed by their Bedford av location in Brooklyn couple months ago i told to myself that i'm gonna stop by at Joe's one day to try their pizza. Ha!"
11-Nov-17,"Fantastic find on Times Square! The pizza is thin and crispy. Sauce is fantastic. We tried the white pizza, pepperoni and fresh mozzarella. All were delicious!"
11-Nov-17,"Amazing pizza if you're visiting NYC go here! Great quality and fast service. First time having NY pizza and I loved it. Caprese is awesome, I also got the white pizza yumm and great place to people watch"
8-Nov-17,"Pizza was great but not the best we've had. No bathrooms though and its pretty dirty. Not meant to be a ""sit down"" eating establishment. We spent $50 on 5 slices and 3 drinks. The hype is definitely the celebrities on the wall and their history not so much the location or pizza."
8-Nov-17,Needed some food. Looked at the ratings on yelp for a quick bite. This looked good. It didn't disappoint. Yum
6-Nov-17,"This place has a nice atmosphere. It's your classic pizzeria! I went with my boyfriend and we had a nice time; sitting on the stools with a cream soda and a nice sized cheese pizza. Plus, tons of celebrities have gone there. You can see celebrities like Jimmy Fallon, Drake, and Anne Hathaway posing with the employees in the pictures that are hung on the walls. Follow me on Instagram for more pictures from my adventures through different cities and states @dyltarbutton"
6-Nov-17,Great pizza!  Thin crust with a nice crunch and flavor.   So glad they opened one up in midtown.   Fast friendly service.
6-Nov-17,"Look, it was good pizza, I just expected more. Definitely crowded with plenty of choices but I can't classify it as great!Crust was actually tough in some places and made it hard to eat. Staff was decent."
2-Nov-17,"Having grown up in new york and in an italian area I've had tons of pizza. The pizza here is NOT new york pizza, this is the tourist version of new york pizza. A real new york pizza has a thicker crust, this was way too thin. Don't get me wrong, the pizza itself was decent enough. But it was definitely not ""new york"" pizza. This is to new york pizza what General Tso's is to chinese food. Would i come here again? probably not. I've got better pizza places in the Bronx."
1-Nov-17,Maybe I'm just not into New York style pizza (sorry) but I was expecting this to be a lot better based off of the reviews. The crust was a little too crispy for me. On the other hand the toppings were great. The mozzarella was out of this world and everything else was really good!
1-Nov-17,First night in New York with my family and we came here. Pizza is most definitely delicious! Service is fast on a busy Saturday night so that's a plus. I will make sure I come back.
31-Oct-17,"Great pizza -- one of the best slices I've had in NYC.  $3-4.75/slice, which is substantially over the ""standard"" NYC pizza price, but well worth it.  Crispy, thin, crust, flavorful sauce (without being so much as to be messy, and classic toppings -- I had pepperoni and supreme, and I'd say the supreme was better, but both were very good.  The white pizza is what I'd try next time."
31-Oct-17,"My husband and I went to New York for our honeymoon. Our mission? Find the best New York pizza and indulge as much as possible. Well, we found this high expectation in Joe's. On our honeymoon, we tried 5-6 different joints but at the end of the day, Joe's beat them all. We had Joe's EVERY NIGHT of our week long honeymoon. I think one of the cashiers started recognizing us because we were becoming regulars!The reason why Joe's is so good is because, for me, the sauce. It's bright in the mouth, and you can taste the beauty of the tomatoes and spices. The crust is thin and crispy. My favorite slice to get was the fresh mozz. The slices aren't very filling, I usually eat about 2-3, while my husband can pack 5 of them in one sitting. It is a little pricey but for the NYC experience, well worth it. I believe the fresh mozz was $3.50 per slice. It might sound steep, but it truly is worth it. The $1 slices spotted around NYC is ok, but very greasy and just not as good as Joe's. Coming from someone who is careful with how their money is spent, I'll tell you right now that this was worth all the money and more. The various times we've come here, the line hasn't been long. Another plus of this establishment. If the line is a bit long, they run through the line quick. The workers here are efficient and good at managing big crowds. There aren't many places to sit, so I've always taken my order to go. It was convenient though because my hotel, the Hampton Inn on 41st was like a 3 minute walk. Me and my husband just want to say THANK YOU JOE'S PIZZA for making our NYC experience perfect and giving us a taste of what real NYC pizza should be like."
30-Oct-17,"Wow.... I'm all about pizza (especially in midtown) but to my surprise this pizza is is really good! I got there  around 12:30 and the line was out the door. Moved pretty fast, which was a plus. All the pizzas were fresh, coming out of the oven and lots of helpful folks taking orders. There's limited seating. Most folks eat while standing up using the tables in the center of the room. You can try grabbing a stool if one is available.The pizza it's thin, perfect amount of tasty sauce and cheese. It wasn't greasy, which for me shows the cheese they used is good quality cheese.My favorite pizza spot for lunch! Will be going back"
28-Oct-17,Good pizza! Had a pepperoni slice and a white cheese slice. Really enjoyed the pepperoni pizza! White was good but I've had better. I wasn't expecting much in time square but pleasantly surprised. You will not be disappointed.
24-Oct-17,The yummiest pizza in New York City! We tried several pizza places but kept on coming back to Joe's for more! You just have to try this!
21-Oct-17,Been looking forward to having NY pizza for the longest time but was underwhelmed by the flavor of the pizza. Seems supper simple and one note. The pizza itself was thin enough to enjoy and thick enough to hold all the toppings. I did enjoy that the pepperoni was not burnt! My husband said he enjoyed the white the most since it was not too oily.
21-Oct-17,"I love Joe's. There are a couple different locations but I was near times square and popped in for a couple slices. It's always fast, crispy, and delicious. Can only but one of the cheapest meals you can get in NY.  Not a ton of space to sit so I wouldn't expect to bring the whole family for a big sit down dinner but for sure worth stopping in whole touring the area. Not the absolute best pizza I've ever had but great, and the archetype for a NY slice."
20-Oct-17,"Once a week, late night! Our pizza spot!! Just got our team there for a late night event dinner everybody loves it. I've previously met James spader in the carmaine street one. No celebrity so far but awesome pizza each time! Think the guys there know me already!"
20-Oct-17,"The regular cheese pizza was great in terms of taste. The crust is done perfectly at this place. I thought the mozzarella slice was not as good, a little bland. Prices are not bad, service is alright but the wait was about 10 mins for them to heat up the slices. Food: 4/5Value: 3.75/5Service: 3.5/5Overall: 3.75/5"
19-Oct-17,"Great meatball classic pie. Crisp, perfect crust. Nice balance of sauce & cheese. I wouldn't change a thing. Delivery was quick and driver was courteous."
17-Oct-17,"Awesome pizza!!!! Great location. Very easy walk from Times Square and gets you out of the overpriced low quality food choices. Authentic, cheap pizza. Family of four ate for around $25. 4 slices (big slices), and drinks."
17-Oct-17,"So delicious! Crispy crust, great sauce... seriously the best pizza in NYC! Fast service and great people watching spot"
15-Oct-17,"Great tangy sauce and crispy crust, but can use a little bit of extra cheese. Otherwise amazing pizza."
14-Oct-17,We were in the mood for authentic thin crust NY pizza and Joe's was the BEST!!! Would highly recommend hitting this NYC staple!!!It was thin with the right amount of crunch and folded in half perfectly!!
13-Oct-17,They are assholes and pizza was that as well. Dry and they charged me for two pizzas so I gave one to someone else because I did not want to argue on the phone with them that I did not order two pizzas and on top of that I Did Not order large. Whatev's it is what is it. Do not order from them because the pizza sucks really regardless them being asshole.
13-Oct-17,"Coming from California we really wanted to eat the famous ""NY pizza"" glad we came across Joe's Pizza!"
12-Oct-17,The pizza here was really delicious. Had the sausage pizza which wasn't greasy at all and had a nice crispy bottom.  I'm looking forward to going back for more!
11-Oct-17,"Joes doesnt need a review. It typically good all over nyc. True NY Pizza. The regular slices are good, thin and well covered. I still prefer the Margareta and Fresh M. Slices.This location is open 24 hours a day I think.Gets busy up midnight during the week.Sure a lot more on the weekends."
10-Oct-17,"Was not busy at all. Service was so so, pizza was no good to me. Although was cheap and large slice I went down street to another pizza place and taste was a lot better. Wouldn't return again. Please was clean"
9-Oct-17,"Is it just me or do these $3.75 cheese slices just taste like other good 99 cents New York slices? I mean it's good, but is it so groundbreaking good? I don't think so. I feel like I'm not also a big fan of the amount of sauce on the pizza, I need more cheese for sure."
9-Oct-17,Late late last night I decided to stop here because I wanted some authentic New York pizza. Yelp did not fail me! The pizza slices are huge and the people are very nice. The place I originally wanted to go was closed but this place stays open very late and I love it! I had a little distance to walk so they gave me a pizza box and some crushed red pepper per my request. The pizza was amazing minus the crust. The crust was pretty hard and had a few bits that tasted like burnt dough. I do not know if this is the style here or anything but I did eat it anyways. The sauces and cheese was delicious and surprisingly good despite how thin it is. I had a good experience!
7-Oct-17,"Classic, glad we finally got to try it. Loved the cheese, husband had pepperoni and sausage and liked it too."
7-Oct-17,"Great pizza! Crust is crunchy with a nice chew. Easy on the toppings, great slice! Had the spinach cheese and the combo. One is plenty. Not much seating. Cross the street and eat in the beer garden."
6-Oct-17,"Joe's is a freaking New York classic, and it gets me sentimental thinking about their pizza. Definitely the dessert of pizza. You can always have a little space for a slice no matter how full you are. First time I went I literally bought one slice, and immediately after eating it (like 5 seconds later) I bought 2 more and one to go. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce, perfectly crisp. Man I miss New York."
6-Oct-17,"Pure pizza slice perfection! New Yorkers may complain that slices are 3 bucks here but Joe's is worth every penny. You can't go wrong here, everything is great!"
3-Oct-17,"I'm a fan of Joe's pizza! I don't think I'd go as far as to say Joe's is the best pizza in NYC like all the celebrities lining the walls do, but it's not as bad as some of my friends made it out to be. It's surprisingly very good! My favorite thing about it is that the crust has a nice crunch to it. Even the tomato-lined pizza had a crunchy crust and tomato notoriously makes pizzas soggy. We got three slices tonight - one supreme, one with mozzarella, tons of tomatoes and basil, and one margherita. The margherita was my favorite but all of them were delicious! I'll definitely check it out again when I'm craving a slice!"
1-Oct-17,"Came for the pizza, but I spent the majority of my time checking out the wall of photos of the owners with numerous celebrities. He's seem to have met just about everyone. But more about the food. I had a slice of pepperoni for about $3. The Pizza itself tasted good, only con is the crust was a little burnt but tasty nonetheless."
28-Sep-17,I can't explain why but this pizza is DELISH! I am not a fan of thin pizza but since this was a new place and half a block from my work I took a chance and I got hooked!!!I tried all toppings they offered and the plain pizza still the best for me. The secret is the sauce guys -- It reminds me my childhood going to the authentic Italian Pizzeria in the corner Street.The atmosphere is also very cool and the staff is very friendly. You can't go wrong with a $3 dollars slice in the  heart of Times Square.
27-Sep-17,Perfect New York pizza. Crispy but not burnt. Location is very convenient. Not a lot of seating though so plan to take your pizza and eat in Times Square.
27-Sep-17,Classic New York style pizza! Now we are talking! Get cheese for classic lovers. It's a must have and great late.
25-Sep-17,"Nom nom nom. Authentic, delicious, and super affordable. A lot of the tourist pizza areas just don't do it right, but Joe's does.The pizza was exactly what I expected. Thin crust, foldable, ideal ratio of cheese to sauce, and light, non-over powering sauce.I walked in at 8p on a Monday night and immediately noticed there was no cheese in the case! The young man insisted it would be out in two minutes. By the time I'd paid, two perfect slices were handed over. While active, the line was short and there was still plenty of seating.So glad to get my NY pizza fix!"
25-Sep-17,"Joe's Pizza came highly recommended from friends. We stopped by around 11PM and there was a line out the door! It wasn't the fastest line, but the food was hot and delicious. Their cheese is $3, with topping $4 is slightly high as I'm use to the $1.50 giant slice of pizza from Costco. The slices are large and they're thin and crispy. Slices are fresh and hot. I highly recommend trying a slice if you're in the area!"
23-Sep-17,"Great pizza, a little pricy but I'm not from NY.  That's probably the price everywhere here.  Great flavor, squishy but crunchy crust.  I will definitely go back."
23-Sep-17,"Awesome service!! The guy that answered was super friendly as well as our delivery guy. Not all that impressed with the pizza. We arrived late to our hotel about 9 blocks away from Joe's and didn't feel like walking. Luckily they were delivering until 3am so we were thrilled! We ordered a large half pepperoni, half cheese. We received half sausage, half cheese. It tasted alright but we wouldn't order from here again. Just wasn't the authentic NY pizza taste we were craving."
20-Sep-17,"I have eaten Pizza in just about every named pizza place (Rays, Johns, Patzeria and others) in Manhattan. This is by far the best. The white pizza is awesome. The Meatball pizza and Traditional cheese are great as well."
19-Sep-17,This place was recommended to me by the hotel I was staying at. I walked in and the line was fairly long out the door. When I got to the counter I ordered a slice of pepperoni and combination they popped it in the oven to heat and it took about two minutes. Service was fine for being busy felt like I was in and out. All in all the pizza was fine not the best I have ever had but good I would return again.
16-Sep-17,Joe's Pizza is hands down my favorite NY pizza and I'm sooo thrilled to see that this new Times Square location (near my office) is just as authentic and amazing as their most famous Greenwich Village spot. No tourist trap here!! This place is a New York City institution with the best quality control in taste and texture  The pizza is dependable AF and the people who work there are nice too. Can never go wrong with Joe's!
15-Sep-17,Always a fan of Joe's . This location is abit bigger along with being newer and cleaner than the others and pizza is always amazing . Great addition to this area .
15-Sep-17,"Question for Joe: how did you make spinach, cheese, and flour taste so good? You are obviously Godsend."
12-Sep-17,"Excellent, crispy, thin crust pizza.  Just what we needed in this area since most of the local pizza places that sell by the slice have closed in the past few years.  Small inside but I was able to get a counter seat at lunchtime.  Will definitely be back!"
12-Sep-17,I ordered a slice of the Fresh Mozzarella for only $3.50 and it was amazing! The texture and taste were just perfect. You cannot go wrong with this traditional NY slice joint.
7-Sep-17,"Terrible pizza, This place should get negative stars. The pizza is burned and the people that work there are not helpful. Horrible pizza place. I would never go back."
6-Sep-17,"I was pleasantly surprised with my NY pizza experience here. The place wasn't crowded but didn't disappoint with the flavor and amazing crust! It was a traditional thin crust that had a nice char on the bottom. Upon ordering a slice of pepperoni pizza ($4), they popped it into the oven to be enjoyed crispy and hot! I bought an additional water bottle from the fridge ($1.50) and was readily rung up. They have a bunch of squeeze bottles with red pepper, cheese, oregano, and garlic powder to add on your slice if you wish. You can enjoy your slice whilst looking at walls filled with pictures of famous people visiting Joe's! :D"
5-Sep-17,"The quintessential NY slice is found here at Joe's Pizza. Thin, with a crispy crust, and the perfect ratio of cheese so that it stays crisp to the last bite. Super fast turnaround at this location just a block from Times Square. I enjoyed a $3 slice of plain cheese before meeting friends from a musical. I highly recommend Joe's for a quick snack/bite between meals."
5-Sep-17,"This is a true NY pizza spot ! The pizza is delicious and consistently good. Love the decor and they keep the pizza cranking out with 3 ovens. I had 4 slices last time I was there. I definitely recommend Joes. Nice people working in there to,"
3-Sep-17,"Had my first slice of pie in NY.. couldn't have chosen a better place!! Super Yummy and delivery was so quick... thanks guys for making my first, the best"
3-Sep-17,"New York style pizza is my favorite style of pizza and Joe's definitely earned a place in my heart. The crust was thin, crunchy, and had a little char to just add enough flavor with the sauce and cheese. The ratio of the ingredients is spot on. Other pizza places have their pizza dripping with oil. Not Joe's though. Everything here was perfectly delicious. Our pizza pie came around $24. Half cheese and half sausage. I heard that the one in Carmine is cheaper but I guess that's the price you pay when your store is near Times Square. This place is absolutely worth it. I look forward to coming back here the next time I visit NYC."
31-Aug-17,"One of my fears is that Joe's Pizza will turn into another Ray's (or Famous Ray's, or Original Famous Ray's, or Ray's Famous Original, etc.).  I'm happy to say that Joe's latest outpost in the Times Square area keeps up the tradition of great pizza served quickly.If you've been to other Joe's (I've been to the ones on Carmine St. and East 14th St.), you'll get the same here.  You'll have to wait on a line, but the line moves quickly.  There are some stools along the window, but if you eat there, there is a good chance you'll be standing up.  And the end product is definitely worth the line.  Also, since there are many customers, the pizza turnover is quick, and your odds of getting a hot, fresh, out-of-the-oven slice for lunch are quite good.Best of all, this latest location is a short walk from my office, so I have a new lunch venue!!!"
25-Aug-17,"Fantastic, crunchy NY pizza. Great price, super tasty! Really fast service right on Broadway, perfect for right after a play or shopping."
23-Aug-17,My favorite slice in NYC is now in Times Square! This is probably their biggest and brightest location. Super friendly staff and of course a clean environment. $3 for a plain slice but if you ask me totally worth it. Fountain sodas and bottles take your pick.. This is def a great addition to Times Square. Especially for the tourist- NY pizza at its finest.
22-Aug-17,"Wow.  This pizza is the real deal.   One of the best I have had in NYC.  The staff was really nice, prices are reasonable and counters are fairly clean.   Worth the walk!"
18-Aug-17,"I'm not sure what the hype is all about, because I found this pizza to be boring. It had no flavor, other than the burnt crust. I don't mind my pizza well done, but it shouldn't taste straight up burnt. I was extremely disappointed and won't be returning."
15-Aug-17,"My office is across the street from this place. Joe's Pizza opened up in Abitino's old spot when they went out of business a few months ago. I've never been to their other locations, but this place is LEGIT. It's easily one of the best, if not THE best, pizza by the slice spots I've ever been to in NYC. The crust is thin and perfectly burnt, the ratio of cheese, sauce, and dough, is spot on. It doesn't get much better than this. Cheese slices are $3 (tax included) -- so a bit high, but delicious. I've tried almost all of the spots in midtown and this is hands down the best in the area."
12-Aug-17,"The Times Square food situation keeps getting better and better, now with a new Joe's.It's just like the other locations, but is a bit bigger than the rest. They have the same great slices, so it's definitely one of the best food options around here now, even though Rock Pizza Scissors is only a block away too. Now tourists can get an actually good New York slice around here."
12-Aug-17,"This place is fantastic! Truly great NY pizza...great sauce, crispy and chewy crust, plus having the guy behind the counter call everyone boss. Great prices and convenient to my hotel - I think I'll  be eating here a lot this week!"
