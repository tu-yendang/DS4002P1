Date,Review
18-Sep-24,Decent amount of people in the morning around 10am. There's always a bar area if you don't mind sitting there. You pay at the front and they will give you the number. The food comes in pretty quickly and not gonna lie it's a big portion. My favorite is the potatoes. Pretty crunchy and soft at the same time. Highly recommend coming with friends
14-Sep-24,I had a full serving of banana French toast. While it was good it was pretty dense and very sweet. I would recommend getting the half serving or sharing the full serving with friends and combining it with on of the more savory options.
9-Sep-24,Omg this place is so yummy! Love the decor and aesthetic inside! The eggs Benedict was delicious. Good service and will be back!
7-Sep-24,"We ordered two meals and two drinks for about $45, which isn't too bad. The California omelette was fresh and the pesto on top is a unique idea that actually works well. The portion is pretty generous too. The banana French toast was reminiscent of a funnel cake to me and he seemed to really like it! The place is super cute and I like that you order at the front and then have a seat. They still came around to check if we needed refills which was nice. Overall, a pretty good place; I would definitely come back to try their Benedicts."
5-Sep-24,"Me and my wife were in the area, and decided to go to Popping Yolk. The wait time was short, but the place was very lively. We were served in about 20 minutes after ordering, and we really enjoyed the chicken sandwich and omelette we ordered."
5-Sep-24,"i have doordashed from this place countless times because i really love their waffles! dined in the other day and it's a walk-up order system where you find a table and they bring the food to you. service is quick, plenty of tables inside, and reasonably priced. if you have a sweet tooth like me, i recommend the toffee banana liege waffles or the berry liege waffles...very delicious!"
5-Sep-24,The coffee was good But the French toast was not the greatest It tasted too much like eggs and oil
3-Sep-24,"I should have stuck with my go-to Benedict breakfast items! Last weekend, I tried their toffee banana French toast and honeycomb strawberry crepe. Both were very good and sweet. The French toast was deep fried, drizzled with maple syrup. The crepe was huge, the caramel drizzle was a surprise! The staff were super friendly and kind, letting me know what were the best sellers in each category. The store is very aesthetic too! You actually order first at the counter then find a spot to sit! Highly recommend bringing your friends and catching up here!"
2-Sep-24,"Food: 3.8Service: 3If I were rating based solely on the taste of the food, I would round up to a 4. However, since service is a component of the review, I'm giving Popping Yolk a 3.My family, a group of five, signed in on the iPad and were told to wait 30-40 minutes. We ended up waiting close to an hour, which we didn't mind. Once we were called in, we were asked to order before being seated. The host informed us that the only seating available for our family was at the bar. Had this been communicated earlier, we would have gone elsewhere. She mentioned that if we preferred a regular table, we would need to wait another 30 minutes. This is the first time I've been told to sit at the bar after waiting an hour, especially for a party of 5. I would like to note that this was on Labor Day so I understand that the establishment was extra busy. I am hoping this is a fluke. As for the food, the California omelette and Classic Eggs Benedict were solid. However, I wouldn't recommend the Classic French Toast, as it was completely fried, leaving an unctuous taste. I also wouldn't recommend the berry waffles, as they were not crispy and were rather soft. My husband didn't love the Cowboy burger either, but that may just be based on preference. If you're looking for a cute and casual brunch spot, I don't think it's a bad option, but the seating left a sour taste in my mouth."
1-Sep-24,"Food was quick and tasty! I ordered and probably within ab 10 mins the food arrived. I was also in a larger group (8 ppl) and most tables were filled! The plate was MASSIVE, I had to save half of it. The latte was good but a bit sweet, I think it's the type of syrup they flavor with. Would get a diff flavor or none next timeService - the cashier was nice, food came out quick and areas were neat and cleanAmbiance - super cute and chill place. Could go there for brunch with friends, date, or even study space. Went on a Thursday around 11am and most seats were taken."
25-Aug-24,"This was our first time at a Popping Yolk location and we fell in love! Such a cute and nice location to have brunch with friends and family. It often gets busy but the wait times are not long. They have an iPad outside to put your name down on the waiting list. You pay for your food first and it's self seating. They have a few tables where it's communal and some that are for larger parties. We got three dishes off of their menu: 1. Cinnamon Apple French toast- tastes like the Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal but with apples on top of it. Definitely on the crispier and sweeter side than regular french toast. It was overly sweet that we didn't need any syrup. 2. Crab cake Benedict's - this was a new item on their menu and our favorite. The cakes had a nice crust to the top but were flakey/soft in the middle. 3. Nashville Hot chicken sandwich - the chicken was perfectly fried and was moist. You get to pick your spice level. We got medium and wish we had gone up a spice level since it wasn't spicy at all. We asked for the coleslaw to be served on the side so the sandwich wouldn't get too soggy. Overall the food, service and ambiance were great! We would definitely go back to try other items off the menu."
25-Aug-24,This place is delicious!  They serve a lot of food and it is scrumptious.  The good thing I liked was that there are no waiters/waitresses so you order when you get there then you sit where you want.  It was pretty cool.  The ambiance is great!
25-Aug-24,"Came back and would definitely have to say one of my fave brunch spots! Took my boyfriend here and he's a protein guy and mainly focuses on eating protein but like bro you only live one life : we eat to enjoy , ANYWAYS LOL, he ordered the classic breakfast, I ordered eggs Benedict with ham & bacon, ube french toast (new item on their menu) , and a hazelnut iced coffee. Food: amazing. Evening was delicious , potato's were well seasoned and crispy , bacon was crispy , eggs were great , but the best dish was definitely the ube French toast! It wasn't overly sweet and the hints of coconut flakes as well as   Topped with cooked blueberries was the best because once you cook down any fruit natural syrup comes from it and it just made the French toast tasty ! total came out to be $50 something, a little pricey but for the portions , ambience, and service is worth it! Even if you order and pay up front you can definitely order more , you would just have to tell a waiter/waitress and you pay right then and there ! For a protein eater my boyfriend was satisfied and would definitely come again . We arrived on a Thursday around 9ish and it wasn't packed but as time went out definitely a lot more people started to swing by !"
24-Aug-24,"Regular food, you can make it at home for $10 instead of $60. No tase practically. Even Japanese  green tea is tasteful"
23-Aug-24,"The food was very good, and everything we serviced quickly. The overall aesthetic of the place is very nice and suitable for a quick brunch with friends."
18-Aug-24,"I've been a long time customer ever since this place opened several years ago, but today I am re-thinking if I will ever give them another visit.Food here has always been great, but today when I called to place a phone order while driving home, I was told that they no longer take phone orders and I will have to order online!How can I order online while driving on the freeway???What bugs me more, was the attitude over the phone and the I-don't-care decision by their management. Is it really that hard to take a phone order? I guess they can care less. There are also people who may not be able to go through the online process for whatever reason. Very disappointing."
12-Aug-24,"Great brunch spot in Alhambra - came on a Sunday morning around 10:30-11 and it was a 40 min wait.  It's a shame they don't do Yelp waitlist so you can join ahead of time online.  Once your number is called, you place your order at the counter before grabbing a number to find a table.  Got the California omelette, classic breakfast, smoked salmon croissant, berry waffles, and mango iced tea (with unlimited refills!).  Their portions were quite sizable so the value is there.  I like that their potatoes are cubed, small, and crispy.  The waffles were good although I wish the sauce/nutella came on the side as it can get a little soggy after awhile, nonetheless it was tasty.  The mango iced tea wasn't too sweet which is how I like it.  There is parking in a lot or structure off 1st Street.  Recommend going earlier if you want to avoid crowds!"
9-Aug-24,Staff very friendly place clean and the food  is delicious breakfast  and lunch very unique dishes  I will  recommend  this restaurant  to anyone who wants to try something new.this is the place
6-Aug-24,Very cute restaurant. I had the classic eggs Benedict and it was delicious. They spice up the classic with bacon. Looking forward to coming back.
6-Aug-24,"I've been to this Popping Yolk location a few times in the past and the food was great, but this recent visit the food quality expectation was not there.Egg Coffee - I had an issue with the coffee itself. The coffee portion tasted mostly milky, creamy, and super sweet. I barely tasted a whisper of coffee. I had to pour some water into my drink to mellow out the sweetness of it. As for the egg foam, I actually liked it as it had a rich custardy and smooth texture. Though all together as a drink, it was too sweet.Ube Pancake - the pancakes texture was pretty dense in my opinion, as if the batter was possibly over mixed. Not sure if a specific flour type was used in the pancake batter that contributed to this texture, but regardless I wasn't a fan of it. Though, the ube flavor definitely delivers, especially with the scoop of ube paste on top. Overall, I found the pancake to be overwhelmingly sweet, mainly from the pancakes appearing to be doused in an ube syrup, and served with sweetened whipped cream and maple syrup. Overall, both items I ordered suffered from being too sweet. The egg coffee can be better balanced if there was more coffee added and less sweetened, while the pancake could benefit from having a fluffier texture and be dialed down on the sweetness. Service was great though, and I was able to be seated quickly in about 15 minutes, even with how busy it was.I've had better tasting experiences in the past, though it's possible that I didn't order the right items this visit. I'd like to visit again in the future and order the usual item I've ordered previously (ex: French toast) and hopefully have a more positive experience."
5-Aug-24,"Eggs Benedict weren't bad, but ube pancakes were disappointing. Ambiance was very IG friendly but they won't seat you until you order. Kinda pricey"
4-Aug-24,"popping yolk has pretty solid food and biig portions that are worth the price! Would highly recommend the french toast! It's really crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, not too sweet. Full portion is 6 slices and half is 3 which is a lot. The savory dishes (eggs benedict & omelet) will usually come with a huge portion of potatoes and salad. you order first then take a seat wherever inside the restaurant or outside in the back with a table number. During brunch times they do have a waitlist and it can be a little longer of a wait but the food usually comes out pretty quickly."
1-Aug-24,"First time here, my first impression was it was a LOT bigger on the inside...I thought it'd be a small space, but it wasn't. Very chill and pleasant vibe overall. The menu is extensive too, took me a LONG time to decide, LOL.I ended up with a Norwegian Benedict, which was made up of poached egg, smoked salmon, spinach, English muffin & I had the Hollandaise Sauce on the side. All the benedict options came with a garden salad & country fried potatoes. The potatoes were REALLY fried, FYI, and they put a lot on your plate. I am not a big fan of overly fried foods, so that was maybe my smallest ""complaint""...maybe they can consider having grilled potatoes as an option in the future!Staff were very friendly and service was pretty fast - though I must have come at a good time, there wasn't a big line when I was there, but towards the end of my meal, there was a line, even on a weekday! They took the orders very quickly though, so the line moved fast.The only thing was there were not as many tables for smaller groups that were ""lower"" - there were a few taller tables with bar stools, for 2-3 people, but I personally prefer regular height tables. They do have two large and longer tables for the larger groups, which would be great for groups to come.  There was also a long bar, for those that wanted to sit individually. A pleasant experience, I'm looking forward to checking out the other items on the interesting menu!"
27-Jul-24,Everything I've had here has been really really good. I don't know what they do to their French toast but it's so good - crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Really liked the Ube pancakes too.
26-Jul-24,Delicious!!Great variety of breakfast options. Casual environment. Parking is easy at the public parking lots.
23-Jul-24,The Eggs Benedict was perfect.  Fast and friendly service. Nice spot in the middle of Alhambra.
22-Jul-24,"I tried the Nashville Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict, and it was hands down the best I've ever had. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection, with a luscious, runny yolk that blended beautifully with the rich hollandaise sauce. The accompanying potato fries were crispy and seasoned to perfection. The portion was insane!"
21-Jul-24,I love this place! The decor inside is cute and the food is always great! Especially if you wanna get a good drink in during the day. It bit pricey but the food was worth it. Love this little brunch spot here in Alhambra  I came on a weekend so expect a wait.
21-Jul-24,"Big portions, mid food & experience. We ordered the French toast, California omelette, & Nashville fried chicken eggs Benedict. The ube latte and Sakura tea were refreshing."
20-Jul-24,"Went for Sunday brunch back in mid-November in 2023. The service was rushed and lackluster, and the food was just ok.  My date and I ordered different Eggs Bennies. Neither included enough Hollandaise sauce and were not all that tasty, which is odd considering how hungry we both were. Dinning here was not worth the 45minute wait time just to be seated AT THE BAR, nor the additional 25minute wait time to receive our food after ordering. The stools at the bar were incredibly uncomfortable too. They were metal and had no cushioning or backs. Also, my food arrived a solid 5 minutes before my date's food arrived. All food for a party/table should arrive together. That's just restaurant 101. The freshly squeezed orange juice for the mimosa and all the plants (real and fake) to give the place a fresh, homey, Earthy atmosphere were the only good aspects of the entire experience. Both my date and I were very disappointed after seeing so many good reviews. I'd consider going back to give them a 2nd chance, but there are so many other good places to go instead."
17-Jul-24,"Visited on a Saturday morning it was busy but not so crowded that we had to wait for a table.Drinks 10/10- Coffee was good.- Orange juice was freshly squeezed and delicious.Food 8/10- I was tempted by the Kimchi Spam Omelette, but $18 for Spam felt steep. Maybe the portion size justifies the price?- Toffee Banana French Toast: good, but not amazing.- Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich: You get to pick your heat level not as spicy as expected for spicy next time I'll request EXTRA spicy, but otherwise excellent. I'd return just for this sandwich.- Bacon and Cheese Sandwich: a typical but tasty sandwich, served with deliciously crispy potatoes.O and the little salad that comes with the sandwiches was good! I enjoyed the dressing.I'll definitely be back!"
13-Jul-24,"There's something about this place! Portions go crazy. Potato's the way I like it - mini, crispy, and tons of it. Crab cake Benedict does all the right things - medium yolk, the right size of crab cake that's crispy enough, coo biscuits, and plenty of salad with that light seasoning to make you feel better about cleaning your plate Also, most things are at least solid here from the French toast to the smoked salmon"
6-Jul-24,"The ambience was great. Even early in the morning at around 8 AM there was so many people there. The service was also good, the waiter and waitresses came out with our food super quickly and they were attentive to our needs. The food however, was OK in my opinion; I thought that the omelette could have used more seasoning, and I put hot sauce on the egg to give it more flavor. The price was also a bit steep, but we did get very large portions. Overall, a good experience."
2-Jul-24,"Very confusing when checking though tablet outside. I was there Sunday afternoon from Arizona. Used tablet outside, after 15-20 minutes of waiting noticed  others going in who had just arrived ordering, given a number and being seated. What's the point of checking with the tablet. When we brought it up with the cashier/hostess she acted surprised and got upset with us. Horrible!"
28-Jun-24,"Wow! Hidden Gem! This place was so good! I ordered through door dash so can't say much for the service portion but I got the Avocado Benedict and it was heavenly! Perfectly poached eggs. Runny in the middle but the whites were not runny and the hollandaise sauce is to die for. Some of the best I've had and they weren't stingy with it, which is a plus for me cause I could drink this sauce! Lol! Yummy is an understatement. Breakfast potatoes and salad were good too. And the Ube latte was the icing on the cake! This place is going in my rotation and can't wait to try the rest of their Benedict's!"
25-Jun-24,"I've been here a couple times. As I've mentioned in a couple other reviews, I get anxious when I have to order, then find a seat myself, which is what you do here. It's not super crowded on weekdays, but I think it gets pretty busy on weekends.I'm writing this review a while after I've had it, so apologies if I don't really remember what I got, but I think I got an omelette and something sweet. The food here is solid, but not like, POW that was SO GOOD. It's solid. The downside is that it is quite expensive, so not a place I'd necessarily frequent. I like bustling places that are not too loud to have a conversation. This is a good place for that. Service was fine. Parking is easy in the free lots around Main Street Alhambra."
25-Jun-24,"My coworkers and I came here for breakfast around 9am on a Monday. The interior was extremely charming! The person at the register was extremely polite and gave us his recommendations when I asked for it.The food was plentiful and delicious! The service was also great! They kept our glasses full and checked on us every so often.The restroom was clean and had 2 stalls in the women's room.There is street parking in front, but at the time we went, it was full. However, there is a parking garage just around the corner with plenty of parking spaces. To be honest, this location is easier to get to than the location in Pasadena.I was so full I didn't even have to eat lunch ! Great place for brunch indeed!"
14-Jun-24,This review is strictly for the customer service.  The girl who greeted us at the register was friendly and welcoming but then we sat down and whoever brought us our water didn't speak to us and then whoever brought our plate simply stated what they had in their hand and then placed it down and walked away.  No one ever came back to check on us or see if we needed anything else.  I would have asked for more water had i actually seen someone.  The food was tasty as usually but customer service truly keeps you coming back.
12-Jun-24,Amazing brunch. The French toast is insane. Perfect Benedict also. Couldn't have asked for more.
9-Jun-24,"Food was good. Not amazing but very good. Nashville chicken was good, but not spicy - chick filet spicy is more spicy but it was good.   Waffles more pancake texture but kids loved them .  Very fresh ingredients .  You order at the counter when you check in then they bring the food; No wait staff."
4-Jun-24,The food was good! The service was great! You order first and then find a table to sit. Didn't have any trouble with that. But it was a very nice little place and the food was great!
3-Jun-24,"The best earl grey latte ever. I drove into LA specifically for this drink. The service was great, and super speedy!"
3-Jun-24,Always a good time for brunch. This place is very popular for a good reason. The quality is consistent. We did have to wait a little bit and it was Sunday at 1 pm. Which was normal lunch time. Food came out promptly after we ordered.
30-May-24,Excellent benedicts!Eggs Benedict is my favorite breakfast item and this restaurant has plenty to choose from.  I've tried 3 different kinds so far and they're all very good. The portions are plentiful and pricing is fair. I haven't tried other items on the menu and probably won't because I just love Eggs Benedict a little too much.Highly recommend!
29-May-24,"I walked into this place yesterday morning with my daughter for the first time. We ordered the avocado Benedict. Very disappointed biting into the Benedict, i was chewing into this white powder which there were chunks of it in the middle of the bread. Had the texture of baking soda. Almost coke like powder in chunks. I was disgusted. I will never come to this place again. It's not worth the price either. The taste was horrible. My daughter also bit into egg shells. It was just a terrible first experience. Too bad i was excited to try it. I'm not going to this place again."
27-May-24,System of seating is terrible. Open tables for 20 min but not seating. Order at counter very slow and s don't know how to turn tables. I won't come back for that reason
24-May-24,"GO EARLY or be prepared for the dreaded wait! The service was great, everyone was nice and friendly. The food came out within a reasonable time.The potatoes are quite possibly the favorite for me LOL. I love them so much! I'd highly recommend the Nashville hot sandwich. It hit the right spot, super flavorful, touch of spice, the sauce was good, and chicken wasn't dry. The burger looked good as well and the omelette was an omelette haha.The French toast wasn't really to my liking (personal preference). It was more like a donut than a standard french toast. Bonus for having cute latte art!I'd come back again for sure, but I don't think I'd go if brunch rush already started haha. ALTHOUGH, they do have an efficient process in having individuals order first and then be seated, it was quite smooth."
22-May-24,"My first time here. The presentation of the food actually looks like the pictures on the menu. The food is Full of flavor.  Loved the potatoes. Ambiance is nice. It's a pretty busy place, but the wait list was not too bad."
19-May-24,Popping Yolk was an excellent brunch experience in downtown Alhambra. We came at peak hours (around noon on a Sunday) and it was about a 30 minute wait for 2 people. You order and pay before you are seated.I ordered the Norwegian Benedict which had the smoked salmon. It was absolutely delicious with the strong smokiness of the salmon and silky yolk that lives up to the restaurant's name! The addition of a light spring mix salad on the side and crispy potatoes rounded out the meal nicely.I'm certainly interested in coming back and trying all the other dishes Popping Yolk Cafe has to offer.
18-May-24,Egg coffee is very good! Service is usually pretty fast and smooth. Has brunch here and the savory stuff is not bad but the sweet breakfast items are a bit overly sweet and lean towards artificial flavoring.
16-May-24,"Cute breakfast place with unique eggs benedict flavors along with pancakes and waffles.  The crepes were tasty, too.The service was on point."
9-May-24,Such a cute place and the food and service was outstanding. My daughter and I split two meals and they were so incredible.
6-May-24,"Mediocre service (except the nice Asian auntie) all around from the younger servers and cashier during brunch on Sunday. I don't mind the price, but if you are charging extra service fees on top of overpriced food and mediocre customer service in a pre-pay, pre-tip environment..leaves a weird taste in your mouth. Patio was not cleaned and had flies and nats while you eat, so don't accept that seating and wait for an actual table inside instead.We'll try the old town location next time. Food was decent, bad service and uncleanliness soured it."
5-May-24,"Food was delicious. Didn't expect to enjoy the toffee banana French toast that much. Loved the deep fried crisp. Florentine Benedict is a lovely vegetarian option (though I found a small piece of bacon which is a big no no!!) I couldn't taste any I've in the latte which was a bummer but the latte itself wasn't too bad. I wish the flavor stood out more. Docked off a star because of service. They served the wrong plate and DID NOT TAKE IT BACK... ended up paying more for breakfast. Was served an all American breakfast rather than the classic Benedict plate (not pictured). Super bummed out over the mistake. Would've taken another star off but the rest of the food was decent enough. Overall, nice brunch place. There was a screaming toddler and other baking on the wall. but the mothers were respectful enough to take the kids outside. Would come back again for the French toast."
5-May-24,"You will need to order and pay as you enter.  Interior modern, inviting and calm.  TOO MUCH food in a plate that it can be good for 2 people.Delicious...delicious....amazing flavors.  The bacon wasn't greasy (baked?) but so crunchy.  Sausage with distinct maple flavor and moist.  Crab cake with coleslaw salad on a soft bread and perfectly cooked egg was just a harmonious combination - every bite was a perfect bite!  Service was great.  Only issue I have was the coffee not strong enough which is subjective.  Can'tWait to come back and try other items."
5-May-24,"Add your name to the waitlist IN PERSON and they will send a text. - Ham and Sausage Sandwich 5/5Imagine an upgraded sausage egg mcmuffin from mcdonalds... but EVEN BETTER. The egg is SO fluffy and pairs well with the salty sausage. The buns are buttery soft. Cheese are melty, ham toasted. - Classic Benedict 3.2/5The buns are very very toasty so it's hard to cut them with a knife. Can't really taste the ham, and the bacon is super super crunchy... the egg is perfectly poached and the hollandaise is good, but not enough! The potatoes side is so yummy! It's fried and crunchy.. the salad is ok. Not enough dressing but it's nice to have something green."
4-May-24,"First time trying out this spot for brunch. We got there just before 11a and there's an iPad for you to enter your phone number and get on the WAITLIST.  You have to wait outside fyi. Waited for 20 minutes before getting a text saying IT'S YOUR TURN. Then you can go inside and Order at the Cashier. FYI * if you have neck issues BEWARE that the MENU is awkwardly HIGH above your head to look comfortably O_O  * Of note, they will charge you a 3% SERVICE CHARGE but you won't know about it until you have looked at your e-receipt.  That's on top of the tip you give them at ordering without knowing how the service will be. Staff was friendly and you go find yourselves a table either inside OR in the smaller outdoor backyard area which is lovely during sunny days. Minus the loud trucks passing by in the backstreet but otherwise it had enough shade. Food took another 15 minutes to come out and here's the verdict: presentation is on point / colorful and lovely to look at. - Avocado Benedict - yummy - California omelette - was on the bland side, and if it wasn't for the pesto on top it would be not as flavorful Both orders came with :* SALAD (which had a deliciously light and flavorful vinaigrette) + * POTATOES that were SO DELICIOUS and tasty and perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside -- except for the tiny pieces which were just too crunchy but TBH I still ate them  Restrooms:- separate ones for each gender and can only speak of the women's but it was clean and had more than 1 stall I'd definitely come back for the potatoes and to try out the more flavorful items on the menu. Parking:- great thing about this location is that within a 3-5 minute walk there are FREE PARKING structures if you can't find street parking since it's on MAIN STREET which can be busy"
1-May-24,My favorite is the pulled pork eggs Benedict the service isn't bad and quickPrices are a bit too highLooks clean
30-Apr-24,"Great brunch. Quant little spot, not too big and not too small. Great variety of breakfast and lunch items. Located in a strip mall so there's plenty of parking. Unfortunately, I was too hungry to take any pics but if you're a carnivore, there's not much selection. If you're going to have a cheat day start here.Service was quick and courteous."
27-Apr-24,"Best brunch in 626 area. Their portions are big, we cannot finish the whole plate. Parking is easy, structure on 1st St."
24-Apr-24,"Another great breakfast spot! Cant really go wrong with anything on the menu. You order then find a table... don't really like this concept, it's a pain."
16-Apr-24,"We we're lookinng for a new spot for brunch around the area,  saw this place in yelp. When we got there, it was a short line. You pay as you order. The only thing is you will look for your own table. Place is aesthetic, great ambiance, service and food was great ."
15-Apr-24,Typical yummy brunch place for their Benedict's and omelette. Their French toasts are insanely sweet and crunchy if you are into that. Love their Benedict's the most though.
14-Apr-24,"Cute and tiny brunch spot to go with friends or solo. They have booths, high top tables and a bar top. The wait time on the self check in ipad initially said 50-60 mins for 2, which I expected a big wait for Sunday at 11:30am but I ended up only waiting 27 minutes! I'd advise to look at the menu while waiting since you do order at the counter before sitting down. The House French toast was super yummy, instead of syrup they put condensed milk on top, but it didn't make it soggy, it was crunchy and soft. The Oj is freshly squeezed in house and it's about 3 oranges per glass. The food does come out separately, but it wasn't a problem for me or my boyfriend. While there is no actual table service, there is a lot of staff that does walk around and will refill waters. I was genuinely impressed with portion size and quality of food, I will be returning to try other items on the menu."
13-Apr-24,"As a native Korean, the kimchi omelette was VERY good. The Norwegian Benedict was also good. The food came out rather quickly. Will definitely be back!"
13-Apr-24,"The Benedict, Green tea latte, caramel latte and House French toast were all amazing."
6-Apr-24,"The atmosphere is good, I ordered the California Omelette. The omelette was appetizing. I ordered it along with a Mocha Latte. The Latte was a bit milky but after stirring the latte I was able to taste the espresso and it was strong. The service was great. We got our food at a good time, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. I would definitely recommend this restaurant."
6-Apr-24,"This place has never disappointed me. Highly recommended, food is tasty, service is excellent! Even though it's busy the qualify of the food and service still remain high. It's a nice environment to hang out with friends and family!"
1-Apr-24,food and service is great here and I've been here multiple times and will return in the future for breakfast and brunch.
29-Mar-24,"My partner and I recently visited Popping Yolk Cafe and left underwhelmed, even slightly disappointed. I ordered the Norwegian Benedict, which I thought was decent with well-cooked eggs, a good portion of smoked salmon, and a flavorful hollandaise sauce. While it was good, it didn't particularly stand out from other Benedict's I've tried.My partner opted for the Popping Yolk Burger with sweet potato fries, which we assumed was a substitute for the regular potatoes. Instead, the cashier made the sweet potato fries as an extra side instead of a replacement, which would've been fine had all items tasted better. The burger had a great presentation but lacked any unique flavor, and the sweet potato fries were just average, but a decent amount of crispy. Given the restaurant's positive yelp ratings, we expected these dishes to be more memorable.On the plus side, service was impressively fast and the portions are pretty good. Our food arrived quickly and each plate came with a LOT of potatoes (which are just fries cut into little cubes) however, all of that comes at a cost--literally. The prices at Popping Yolk leans towards the expensive side, which would be justifiable if all the dishes we ordered tasted better. That being said this was our first time here and there are a lot bunch of items on the menu that wehaven't had a chance to try much else (including French toast, which actually looks really yummy.)For now, if you're in a rush and don't mind spending a bit more, it might be worth a visit. However, if you're seeking a meal where every dish is delicious, you might want to explore other options."
28-Mar-24,"Loved the environment sm, cute place for a little brunch date! Drinks were a little on the expensive side but the food was 10/10, definitely recommend"
27-Mar-24,"went around 10 there was no wait, the food was really good i loved the crispy potatoes that come as a side definitely recommend the toast! it's crunchy i don't know it's so good there service is good a bit small inside so i think it's best to go early before it gets busy. there freshly squeezed orange juice is also a must try !"
16-Mar-24,"Came here on a Saturday at 11:30 for a group of three. Parking can be a bit rough as it is busy with tons of other small moms and pops. I was able to find parking around the corner on the street though. Most parking is limited to twenty five minutes to two hours so keep that in mind .This place is very easy to spot as it is a bright yellow building. It's very small, so I'm glad the color made it easy to find. This place is really nice inside and has beautiful aesthetics as it has tons of plants. It definitely is giving spring vibes. They have seating indoors and outdoors in the back. They have an iPad outside that you need to sign in on before you even order. So you sign in on the iPad they call you when your table is ready, although you do not get to pick where you're going to seat since that wasn't an option the iPad. You order first and then they seat you.I ordered the Ube French toast. My friend ordered the eggs Benedict. And we also ordered strawberry and blueberry pancakes. The pancakes were very basic to us. The eggs Benedict lax flavor in their hollandaise sauce. The best out of the three was definitely the oy French toast. It's giving Ube and funnel cake vibes together. We definitely enjoyed that the most.Almost forgot, I also ordered popcorn chicken and that was very good as well. I wanted a chicken and waffle vibe and I got popcorn chicken and Ube French toast and they were the perfect pair for sweet and salty. My breakfast was about 30 bucks which included an oy coffee. The coffee didn't really have the flavor of obey for me so I wouldn't recommend that. Overall, it was an amazing experience. We enjoyed our food, the service and the aesthetics. It wasn't crazy packed either, so I was really happy about that."
16-Mar-24,The Popping Yolk burger was mediocre. I would rate it three stars if it weren't so expensive.
11-Mar-24,"This is easily one of my favorite places to go when I want something fresh and delicious almost everything on the menu is so delectable and created with Care. The service here is fantastic. I never feel like I have to ask too much of the staff here they always come by and make sure that everything on my dish is well-made and warm even down to the lattes and the tea I highly recommend getting the Sakura green tea, it has a entire pitcher just for you. I come here often take my mind off of the week get some work done or spend a little time with my kids when it has been pretty hectic. It can get very busy very quick on the weekends and evening, but for the most part, if you come early enough, it's delectable."
9-Mar-24,Spring salad was amazing.  Had a side of popcorn chicken that had the perfect texture and seasoning.  Great trendy ambience that even families could enjoy.  Long wait but worth it.
8-Mar-24,"Hi everyone, went here for the first time because my bestie's favorite place was closed. We had high hopes and ordered the ube coffee which turned out to be the best part of our meal. I ordered the Florentine eggs Benedict and after the hunger subsided it dawned on me that the mushrooms were flat and the spinach was cold. My bestie ordered the mixed berries crepe and scrambled egg, I was surprised to see frosted flakes in her crepe when it was brought to the table. The scrambled eggs were runny and had an after taste, I was I glad I didn't order those. We ate half to be polite and wanted to tell the server our thoughts but they never came.The coffee is worth it and maybe their potatoes. For a place called Popping yolk...."
5-Mar-24,"Never been here, wow best French toast ever with good amount of syrup ! How crunchy of the toast still makes me wanna go there again.for the fish fillets not a fan of it by itself but when you eat together with bread and coleslaw is completely game changer.Is a must try for this spot.For service you have to order and pay at the front then system will ask for the tips I recommend to do at least 15% since staffs will help you with drink&food and still bussing table. So it's a great place to chill with friends no rush.definitely coming back!"
2-Mar-24,First time here and I have to say the food was great and the prices are decent. Staff was very nice and the place was very clean. Will be back again.
2-Mar-24,"Solid place for breakfast, preferably earlier to beat the brunch rush during the weekend."
27-Feb-24,"We come here on and off, and started since when they had their soft opening. It was delicious at the beginning, but it's seems like their quality decreased over the years. The last time was still decent, so we came here again today with high hopes. It left us with more disappointment. We ordered the French toast, California omelette, seasoned fries and the fresh OJ. The French toast got fried too much, too oily and crunchy that the taste was not there, just the flavor of the syrup. The omelette plate was too greasy. The proportion of the mushroom, spinach and tomato for the omelette was not right either, so it was more like mushroom omelette. The seasoned fries was good and the OJ was the best of all."
27-Feb-24,"Popping yolk is one of the most delicious brunch spots that I have ever been to. They offer a large range of different egg staple mills. Like omelette, eggs Benedict. Also, if you don't like eggs, you can get French toast, pancakes and sandwiches. You gotta try it out. The statics of this place is perfect for a girls brunch and the service is nice and accommodating"
25-Feb-24,I'm pleasantly surprised.  My first time there meeting a coworker friend for brunch and she was the one who yelped this place. My avocado and ham croissant was delicious. I would definitely go back
18-Feb-24,"The food was alright however the service actively bothered me, it took the staff half way through our meal to give us our water and I had my hand up while making eye contact with 3 different staff and no one came"
15-Feb-24,"Nice staff But as another yelper noted, this place serves cold food, cold coffee and it was freezing there.I will not be returningTGOE"
14-Feb-24,Mia was very sweet and took our order. I always order the Nashville Hot Sandwich. The slaw is the perfect balance of sweetness to contrast the savory & spicy flavor of the chicken. I substituted the salad side and house potatoes for seasoned fries. There's also the option for Cajun fries. I always order the hazelnut latte. Alexis made mine this morning and it was PERFECT. Perfect thick foam. Our food came to our table super quick. Both Mia and Alexis were great on this busy Valentine's Day. They kept checking in with our table if we needed anything. The music was a great ambience and not too loud to make conversation across the table impossible but also filled with a fun lighthearted vibe.
10-Feb-24,Crab cake egg benedict: 3/5The hollandaise sauce and crab cake was good. Well balanced and light on the tongue. The cold slaw and salad on the side had too much vinegar so it just overpowered everything else. House french toast: 1/5It felt like eating overcooked deep-fried slice of bread. It was very dry and had no flavor. The blueberries were all shriveled and the whip cream was ok.
6-Feb-24,"I came here to pick up brunch, I ordered ahead.  It looks very cozy and cute inside.  It was perfect timing, by the time I snapped few pics, my order was ready.  I had the Nashville hot chicken Benedict one of my favorites here.  This is so delicious and the eggs popped, hence the name popping yolk.   lol.  Instead of potatoes, I opted for all salad.  Everything was fresh and delicious!!  You can choose the spice level for your chicken, I got medium.  I've also dined here many times with my daughter and friend, but first time to review.  They have excellent service and the staff are nice and helpful.  There's so many brunch items to choose from, you'd want to try at least two.  Last time, we also had the French toast with berries and that was delicious, as well."
5-Feb-24,"Whether it's the Pasadena or Alhambra location, Popping Yolk is always delicious, with a wide variety of brunch options, all of which are phenomenal. My personal favorite is the Nashville hot chicken sandwich, but the waffles, French toast, and eggs Benedicts are also amazing. It's a little hard to flag down a waiter at times, but overall a wonderful brunch spot."
2-Feb-24,"Been searching around for a brunch place in the area that is more American as there are plenty of Asian options, but i also don't want to settle for ihop or denny's (no offense, i love them but there's just a time and place for them you know). the place is super cute, and i love that there is some unique options that have asian and American fusion breakfast, the food portions are huge for its price, and they are all super duper delicious. There is parking lot generally around the area or street parking. It is usually not too busy, and the staffs are super friendly. You pay first but then the waiters come out with your food and will continue to come for the refill coffee I would come back again!"
31-Jan-24,"Love coming here for brunch, the food is delicious and the service is great . I 100% recommend!!"
27-Jan-24,Amazing food. Ordered Norwegian Benedict and it was way better than expected. The plate comes with a salad and fried potatoes. Friendly staff. This place looks clean and welcoming. First time here. Will definitely return.
27-Jan-24,Great food and excellent service. Menu has lots of options. Try  the mango green tea.
25-Jan-24,"This should be called Freezing Yolk. We had the pulled pork Benedict and Nashville hot chicken Benedict along with the banana toffee French toast. Also what was supposed to be hot coffee and a hot cappuccino. EVERYTHING was cool to the touch. Not even kinda warm. Certifiably cool in temperature. The restaurant was not crowded and we were served fairly quickly, so it's not like the food should have been sitting out for too long. That said, the restaurant itself was cold too. The flavors were actually pretty good. But even if it's 100 degrees outside, if I order food and drinks that are supposed to be hot, they should be...hot! Even my better half, who doesn't need anywhere near steaming food, was put off and was wondering whether this meal was premade and failed to be heated. Keyword: fail. And did I mention freezing? We really were looking forward to this meal after reading the reviews, but left sorely disappointed. And shivering."
22-Jan-24,Good customer service. Food is so good and filling. I would recommend to my friends and family
20-Jan-24,Food was delicious. Those fresh toast were great. Even my son ate half of my smoked salmon sandwich. The horchata latte was good and not super strong. Service was quick. You order when you arrive and get a number to get your food served. Cute place. Perfect for large parties or be at the bar.
20-Jan-24,The food is super delicious and the service is great! Waiters are nice and friendly and have good recommendations since it was the first time eating there. Food was served nice and HOT! just how I like it. The place wasn't super busy but it seems like it would get packed later in the time. Nice ambiance would definitely go back!
16-Jan-24,Finally Alhambra has a brunch placeFood is good and has variety to choose. In service they do their best to satisfy their customers. I like high ceiling  which they have and feeling is more space. By the eay ı loved their Ube french toast excellent
9-Jan-24,Always can expect a tasty breakfast here!  Love the ambiance.  French toast is very tasty but what isnt when its deep fried..lol! This place hers my vote for my favorite breakfast pkace.
8-Jan-24,"One of my favorite brunch spots.  You can't go wrong with their eggs benedict! The classic is the best.  The hollandaise sauce is good, it's creamy and not too tangy. I normally try to avoid eating too much carbs, but their potatoes are irresistible. Their french toasts and waffles are also yummy.  I usually park on the parking structure nearby.  You can park on the streets as well.  Their service is good.  You need to order and pay for your food in advance.  If there's a line, you can put your name on the waitlist on a station in front of the cafe."
3-Jan-24,"This place is nestled in downtown Alhambra, and I honestly expected more. There was a wait, and the inside decor were quite nice. The service was fast and efficient (you order at the front then sit). However, I thought the food was mediocre at best."
29-Dec-23,Delicious breakfast/ brunch place. Everything we ordered was delicious and it came fast.
23-Dec-23,Food was amazing. Every dish from smoked salmon to omelet to apple cinnamon French toast to toffee banana crepe. Sooo good. Already thinking of coming back even though I just ate here
19-Dec-23,"Came here with some friends and had such a great time! You order first then sit down. It is pretty spacious and thankfully it wasn't too busy. I ordered their Florentine Benedict and it was CHEF'S KISS! The muffin was nice and soft, I loved how flavorful the mushrooms and spinach were and the poached egg was perfectly cooked. Pretty big portions although most of it are potatoes, it was delicious and filling nonetheless.I would definitely be back again!!"
18-Dec-23,"Im a first time visitor and I absolutely loved the brunch experience here. The food was delicious with generous portions. We had the avocado benedict,  the filet benedict, a mocha, and a hazelnut oat milk latte. The service was great and they gave us suggestions to try since it was our first time. I will be going back to try other dishes. Can't wait!"
18-Dec-23,"This place never disappoints. Delicious, consistent food every time we've been here. It's dessert for breakfast, brunch or lunch. We ordered the Cinnamon Apple French Toast (1/2), Crunchy Honeycomb Crepe, Croissant Avocado and Ham sandwich, and the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict with coffee. Even the coffee was made just right; not too strong and bitter, yet not weak. Andrew took our order and served us. He was on top of it when one in our party hadn't yet gotten her food, but saw it was on its way and let us know. He gave us the perfect blend of space and service - refilling our drinks when needed. If you love breakfast foods, this is your spot!"
17-Dec-23,Great food. Fast service! I would definitely come back. Helpful tip : Sunday mornings best to arrive by 9-915 the latest to avoid the crowd. We walked in at 9am and by 930 there was a line out the door!
12-Dec-23,Bro I don't even like breakfast food I had the crab cake bennedict and OMG I'm in love it was fucking delicious and the vanilla latte was so good seriously best breakfast spot ever !!!!
10-Dec-23,Favorite brunch spot - it gets busy sometimes but still always fresh ingredients and always made to just right.
10-Dec-23,Service is good. Food is ok the eggs were very well done. Salmon a little salty but still ok. Now the utensils provided were very cheap and should not have been used. It cheapened the experience. I would suggest that they upgrade the utensils immediately.
8-Dec-23,I wanted to like this place but it was pretty hit and miss for me. The portion sizes are huge though. I ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich and French toast as well as an Ube latte. My gf ordered the mango habanero(?) omelette. The chicken in the sandwich didn't have much Nashville seasoning on it? It just tasted a bit spicy. And the French toast was fried. It was my fault for not seeing it was fried on the menu but it just tasted like oil to me unfortunately. I could only eat one piece and a half order comes with 4 pieces. My gf said the sauce for the omelette was too sweet for her. I did enjoy the latte as well as the salad and would be willing to try other items on the menu. The place was packed. They don't take reservations so going earlier is a bit better. They are able to seat big parties and it's hard to park but there's a lot a block away.
3-Dec-23,"Food was good but I was personally not happy with the options on the menu.  Also, the music was way too loud.  This place was a bit too trendy for my taste, but obviously a lot of people must like that vibe.  If you do, go there; if you like more peace and quiet when you are eating, this place may not be the best place for you."
2-Dec-23,"Got here around 10:50 on a Saturday and signed into the iPad waitlist that's outside. The wait was under 5 mins and once you are inside, you order at the front and they'll give you a number. You can sit anywhere and they'll bring the food over.The inside of the restaurant is very cute with some holiday decorations! There are tables and bar seatings (no outdoor seating).Our food came pretty quickly and I ordered the mango habanera chicken benedict, which is apparently a new item on the menu. The potatoes are super crispy and the veggies are super fresh. On to the actual benedict - there's a fair amount of chicken in there and the slaws are delicious (to be fair I normally don't like slaws that much). The only thing is the sauce is a little bit too sweet and wished the mango flavor is stronger. The overall portion is pretty big!   Pro tip: check in on the iPad that's set up outside once you get here since I don't see a Yelp waitlist through the app."
30-Nov-23,"Brunch do-over at the Popping Yolk Cafe - Alhambra location. We had previously tried to drop by their Pasadena location, but there was a long wait, so we decided to check out this location instead when the opportunity came up. You order and pay at the front and seat yourself, no frills on the service. It's a pretty casual diner-like environment.My boyfriend had the Ham and Cheese Omelette ($16.50) and I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict ($18) with a Lychee White Sangria ($10.50/glass). The drink came out first and the food came out a bit after. I was surprised by the large portion. Each of the orders came with both a salad and a mound of country fried potatoes. Definitely not a delicate brunch. I find their salad to have a lot of long leaves, getting some salad dressing on my face, which I don't enjoy. The country fried potatoes were the star of the dish, being very crispy and crunchy. I think I liked it more than my benedict. The pulled pork was overly sweet, even more sweet than typical pulled pork. The egg was poached well, which was nice. My sangria could use a stronger touch of lychee for my preference. If something is in the name, I really want to taste it. I liked it but I can't say I love it or have any strong desires to come back. The country fried potatoes were the most memorable thing on the plate. I will have to say I'm glad I didn't wait at their Pasadena location if this was all the hype."
16-Nov-23,"My friend and I came here after a visit to the SGV for a concert and while we were deathly afraid of loud noise and bright light, popping yolk did a good job helping us recover! The ambiance of the restaurant was very mellow and casual and the energy gave a relaxing brunch.The Norwegian Egg Benedict was a delightful deviation from the traditional, featuring perfectly poached eggs nestled on a bed of smoked salmon and a fluffy English muffin. The hollandaise sauce was rich and velvety, adding a decadent touch to each bite. The dressing  with the mixed green salad that they provided us also provided another layer of bite when paired with the eggs, I heavily recommend this dish as it is their signature!"
12-Nov-23,"Good breakfast stop, enjoyed the atmosphere and the neighborhood it is located in. Definitely worth the stop! The two egg dishes we tried were cooked to perfection."
12-Nov-23,First time here at Popping Yolk Cafe. We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. With all the good reviews we decided to give it a try. Sorry to say we are quite disappointed. We ordered the Avocado eggs Benedict and the Ube French toast. Both were not as good. The service was fast. At least we didn't have to wait that long. But the food was not that good! Not as we expect it to be from all the reviews!
11-Nov-23,The food was delicious!!!! The waitlist goes by pretty fast. You have to order and pay before so definitely recommend reading the menu while you wait! The french toast is so crispy which i liked. They also bring out the food pretty fast as well. Overall the ambiance was really pretty and would recommend to take loved ones here to show the pretty scenery
7-Nov-23,Amazing brunch spot in downtown Alhambra!The yellow building can't be missed! I went with a group 4 for Sunday brunch and the wait was only 20-25 minutes at 12pm. You order at the counter and grab a table. Food came out quickly and the portions were very filling with country fried potatoes and salad. The hot chicken benedict was great and so was the salmon omelette! We also got ube french toast to try and it was a bit dry but extra syrup helped. Would definitely come back again to try the other items!
4-Nov-23,Almost passed out as I saw the Ube French toast come out of the kitchen... my mouth watered so much they had to put the wet floor sign out. Went to the bathroom with such satisfaction. ;) Highly recommend this place after a Sunday morning hike or brunch date!
3-Nov-23,Food was really good. Large portions. Clean restaurant.  The only negative was the 3% service charge.
2-Nov-23,My boyfriend & I decided to try out this place after seeing it was only 5 minutes away from our hotel. I am so glad we stopped by! I don't remember what flavor coffee I got but it was an iced something latte & it was super good. My boyfriend got the bacon & cheese sandwhich on a croissant & added avocado. They forgot to add it in the sandwhich but once I told the cashier he had them bring it out on a plate! I appreciate how fast they got that to us. I got the bacon and cheese Sandwhich which was so good! I really liked the sweetness of the brioche bread. The potato's were very good as well my bf said that was his favorite part lol. I also liked the salad because it was light and refreshing. We also decided to share the banana toffee French toast which in my opinion was the star of the show! I'm still thinking about them today  it was honestly so much food that we could have ordered a half plate but we got greedy I would say I really liked the ambiance of the place & although it is on the pricier side for breakfast I would still come back.
1-Nov-23,"Came for the first time to celebrate my sister's 18th birthday expecting at least half of the ""good things "" people commented about this place. However we got total opposite starting from the unprofessional service to the poor customer attention. Only ok thing was the food which I would of regret completely coming here if it turned out a disappointment as well. Had to ask for a manager as they asked for tips at the beginning which makes no sense since you pay for how they treat you throughout the meal but anyway manager wasn't even there or at least that's what they said so no wonder things were running this bad. Not coming back!"
31-Oct-23,"Popping Yolk always hits the spot! I always order the Eggs Classic Benedict with an Americano  Ps. I love how crispy the potatoes are! If this is your first time going, wait times can vary especially if it's the weekend. However, keep in mind that you order at the counter before being seated. This is perfect if you're going to meet with friends (you won't have to split the check or anything at the end of your meal lol) Ambiance is pretty solid! Staff is pretty friendly... A great plus for this location is that parking is rarely an issue!"
23-Oct-23,"Cute small spot, walked in today which was a Monday around 11am and the place was busy. You order and pay upfront before your seated which I didn't mind. Ube French toast was bomb! Popcorn chicken and onion rings was just ok. I didn't get to try the Benedict but they said it was really good. Def coming back to try the other French toast items."
23-Oct-23,So yum!!! Tried 3 of the french toasts and they were delicious! Definitely coming back again for that Taro French toast.
21-Oct-23,"This place was so good. Too bad they are a little far for me bc I would totally go weekly or evenly daily. I love brunch and I will say everything I saw looked delicious. I ordered the Nashville Benedict and the Apple Cinnamon French toast. I couldn't finish either because it was so much food. Chris the host was helpful with recommendations. She suggested the French toast and it did not disappoint. The chicken was tender, the eggs cook perfectly. I seriously can't wait to go back to try something else."
18-Oct-23,Great place to have food take out. Great service and friendly. Food is addicting. Love this place.
17-Oct-23,Ok I loved this place a lot and always ordered the Nashville chicken Benedict every time I meet with my friend here. Literally the only thing I'd order from here with their delicious horchata latte.  I don't know when they changed the breading of this...But this is not what it was like.  This shouldn't be called Nashville chicken if the breading stays this way. I was pretty sad I paid $18 something for a dish I didn't expect to get
11-Oct-23,"It's difficult to find western brunch places in SGV and this is probably one of the few choices if you aren't into Asian breakfasts. The food is decent and okay, nothing to write home about. The French toast was overly sweet and very one dimensional - not something I would order again. Prices are on the high side. Service was fine. Casual brunch setting."
10-Oct-23,"I have been to the popping yolk in Pasadena for a few times, wanted to try the Alhambra location. The restaurant is located on Main Street and it has a different vibe. The food quality and food service are equally good. We ordered the California and Florentine Egg Benedict. The eggs are nicely cooked and the side potatoes are crispy. I wanted to try the Ube latte since I usually order the hazelnut latte. The ube flavor was a tad subtle that I thought it tasted like a regular latte. I'd probably try the caramel or go back to the yummy hazelnut latte. This location is slightly smaller than the Pasadena location. For the same price and service, I'd prefer a little farther drive up to Pasadena for a roomy and comfy ambience. All in all, it's a nice restaurant in old town Alhambra."
9-Oct-23,"First time eating here and the service was fast even with the place being packed.  The food is excellent in my opinion.  I had the original eggs Benedict with bacon and ham, came with potatoes cooked to perfection (crispy on the outside and hot on the inside), also a salad with balsamic vinaigrette.  The atmosphere is laid back with customers having conversations and enjoying there breakfast.  Of course I had a mimosa or two because it's brunch and that's the rule.  Definitely coming back to try there delicious food and experience the friendly staff that made my brunch so much more enjoyable."
7-Oct-23,"I went for a brunch and everything was amazing , the food , service and the decoration 10 of a 10"
4-Oct-23,"Food was very delicious, brought my mom for her birthday since she is a morning person you know how that went Fried French toast hit the spot and the lattes too. Service was very fast and  amazing and ambience too."
30-Sep-23,Spam kimchi omelette and Norwegian Benedict was fabulous! Really cool ambience. Would come here over and over again.
27-Sep-23,I've been here before but it took a few years to come back bc there's always a wait. Came on a weekday morning to no wait and had their Norwegian Benedict and house french toast to share among two. I usually feel stuffed after eating a benedict bc of how heavy it is but this one left me feeling pretty good. The smoked salmon was a tad salty but not overbearing when eaten with the runny egg. Portion sizes are generous and we left feeling full after sharing an entree and a side. This place is a honestly a little gem in an area so saturated with Asian food!
25-Sep-23,"FOOD: I've been coming to Popping Yolk since it opened in 2019, and my go-to orders are the Smoked Salmon Omelette ($19) & Norwegian Benedict ($19). For sweets, their House French Toast is yummy too ($9.50/$16)!- Pretty consistent quality from all the times I've been, and most orders come with a side salad and breakfast potatoes/toast as well.- The Smoked Salmon Omelette was a tad bit salty the first time I ordered it, so I've been asking for it with less salt since and it's been a lot better! Good portion of smoked salmon, spinach, and mushrooms inside. I wish the eggs weren't cooked as dry.- Their benedicts are good, but I have run into a few occasions where the yolk of the egg was too well-done. - I've tried the latte once and it's pretty standard, can skip it.SERVICE/AMBIANCE: This place gets PACKED, especially on weekends, so I would recommend going around 11 AM if you are planning a weekend brunch. You order at the front and pay before getting seated, then they bring your food to the table. Feels like a mix between quick/table service; there is outdoor seating as well in the back. OVERALL: Although, I would recommend this place as a brunch spot, I do think it is a tad expensive. After tax, it's over $20 for an omelette, and most would probably argue that they could make it themselves. Plus seeing the over 30% price increase since I first came was a bit crazy..."
24-Sep-23,"Very disappointed in the food. The items came in a peculiar order, 1 entree (ham and cheese omelette), then another entree (crispy honey comb crepe) 15 minutes later, and then our appetizer (fried calamari). The delay on the entree was blamed on our section being ""slow."" By time my appetizer came I had forgotten I ordered it. Instead of telling us they ran out of whipped cream to make our crepes, they filled them with fake whipping cream, (which I actively dislike) and then put the remnants of their real cream on the outside as if we wouldn't notice. Well I did and that made it inedible to me. My companion did not care and opted to eat it, but I would have preferred a refund for the crepe. When I commented about the difference in cream to the waiter, they seemed confused and said, ""Oh it should be the same. It tastes different?"" Oh yes, it tastes very different. The ham and cheese omelette was mid and the fried calamari is from a bag. The lychee sangria did not taste like lychee, but the egg coffee was very good. Touching briefly on the service, we arrived about 90 minutes before closing and it felt like the staff wanted us gone. They were ignoring us when we raised our hands or looked around hoping someone else would answer us. At one point a staff member who had clocked out flagged down our waiter, but he did not acknowledge it until we made eye contact. I will not be coming back here. This would have to be someone I love's favorite restaurant."
24-Sep-23,The best coffee I've ever had just amazing.  Not to mention the high quality bacon I had as a side dish to accompany my fried French toast that's just amazing as well. I highly recommend this spot. The eggs Benedict are amazing as well along with the potatoes. You must try Popping Yolk!!
21-Sep-23,"Did someone say brunch? Count me in...and a group gathering? Even better.  Met some fellow yelpers from near & far on a Saturday morning.  I had read some reviews and was excited to try their food. You order at the front counter as soon as you walk in, they give you a number, and when your order is ready they bring it to your table. It was packed and people kept coming in.  We sat outside in the back to accommodate our large group.  It was the perfect table.  Most of my yelp friends ordered their infamous Eggs Benedict which I personally have never been a fan of.  So, this AP went with a 1/2 order of the deep fried French toast w/fresh berries.  (My friend Mikey ordered the same exact thing! Woo hoo!) It is as good but a bit too deep fried and crunchy. Next time I will order the waffles.  I also ordered a latte with an add shot and asked for light foam. It was all foam, just sayin.  3 sips and poof...it was gone! *The eggs Benedict servings were huge and came with potatoes & salad!!! Lucky. *Location seemed a little sketchy but safe.  *Plenty of street parking.  Read the signs.  Also a few parking lots.  *It gets very busy on the weekends - from opening to closing"
21-Sep-23,I would come back for the crispy potato cubes alone! Perfectly gooey egg and a toasted English muffin. Even the chicken was crispy. What's not to love?
21-Sep-23,"Thanks to Auntie Nadine for setting up the UYE. I love Eggs Benedict. I wanted to get the crab cake one. I asked the cashier if they used real crab or imitation crab. Her response was that she wasn't sure since she never had it before. That's never a good response to give to a customer. If you're not sure go ask your manager. I wanted the real crab, but since she wasn't sure I went with my second choice.The Ube French Toast looked appetizing. Ube is huge these days and seem to be everywhere. I really liked the French Toast as it was crunchy. They batter it and fry the whole thing. The Horchata Latte was also very good. It wasn't very sweet and I could taste the hint of horchata. I like the design they made on it with the foam. It was fun meeting with the Yelpers from LA. A big thank you to Emmett for coming from San Diego and bringing the schwag."
20-Sep-23,"Everyone should come early to check in because it is a long wait if you come during the busy times. My Nashville hot chicken was very delectable and had a nice kick to it for a medium spice I asked for. The chicken is crispy in the outside and juicy on the inside. The potatoes were amazing too, not soggy at all. Salad was good too, gives the plate a nice color. I would definitely come back again. I would take my boyfriend. You have to order in front of the restaurant and then take your seat that the hostess provides for you. It was very good."
19-Sep-23,"this is easily my favorite brunch spot  the servings are huge and my favorite item would definitely be the norwegian eggs benedict along with the french toast. the hash rooms are probably my favorite part of the dish and i always feel satisfied whenever i come here. you order at the front and then sit at a table to wait for the servers to bring your food and the greenery decorations in the environment make for the perfect brunch aesthetic. it does get pretty crowded on the weekends, but not too bad if you come slightly earlier."
19-Sep-23,"Brunch with ten Yelp friends in Alhambra, California...I needed to find a place to accommodate a large group, and Popping Yolk Cafe fit the bill!We all found free street parking on a Saturday morning. The restaurant didn't take reservations, so, luckily, a few people arrived early and arranged tables outside for us... thank you!Inside, the tables were occupied, and the volume level was high as happy customers chatted together. The line to order was out the door... wow... this is a popular spot! The cashier kept her cool as we added onto our table's number: 35. Our food was brought to us promptly. I ordered the new menu item: Caprese salad. I enjoyed the cherry tomatoes, mozzarella cheese balls, and pesto that rimmed the bowl! The vinaigrette dressing balanced out the arugula so that it wasn't bitter! This was a wonderful experience as we all caught up with each other while some of us made new friends! Note: Thanks to Emmett, who drove all the way from San Diego and brought us Yelp schwag!P.S. my friends really enjoyed their Crunchy French Toast and delicious Eggs Benedicts!"
18-Sep-23,"We recently enjoyed a weekend brunch at this downtown Alhambra location of Popping Yolk Cafe. There were 11 people in our party, and only one had dined here before. As an out-of-town visitor, I wasn't sure how the parking situation was, but I was able to score a two-hour curbside spot almost directly in front of the business. Reservations were not accepted so the first two of us who arrived placed our orders at the service counter up front. The staff allowed us to occupy a set of tables squeezed together in the back patio which was perfect.Supposedly, the weekend crowds start showing up at 10 am. This happened to be our meeting time so the stragglers in the group encountered a bit of wait to order their food. The individual dishes were delivered to our tables fairly quickly. The menu was chock full of choices with benedicts, French toast, omelettes, crepes, and waffles featured for breakfast. The lunch categories were sandwiches, salads, and burgers.I opted for a Smoked Salmon Omelette which contained spinach and mushroom with the lox. A piece of toast, garden spring, and country fried potatoes came as sides. It was a large serving of food that I managed to consume about half before placing the remainder in a take-out box. You will definitely get your money's worth from the portion size. I couldn't find much to nitpick about because the kitchen did a great job of cooking and plating the item."
18-Sep-23,"Classic BenedictReally nothing special here. Order when you enter then find a seat. Hollandaise sauce was just ok. As we're the eggs and salad. Really nothing to complain about, but nothing to get excited about either. The potatoes were the star of the show. Perfectly crispy.  The restaurant itself is comfortable and friendly. There are a wide variety of benedicts and other breakfast items to pick from.Edit:Candy, thank you I will. I forgot I had reviewed the restaurant over 2 years ago and ordered the same thing. I guess I'm a creature of habit. I'll try something new next time."
13-Sep-23,"Everything is just okay.  Including food, service, and ambiance.  Nothing particularly good or bad.  Just a place for brunch."
11-Sep-23,"Tried for the first time and it was overall pretty good! I got the Norwegian Benedict and it was really good, their potatoes are super crispy and delicious but the pieces are a bit small so some were just crunchy bits. Also ordered an oat latte which wasn't my favorite, would suggest the teas over the coffee drinks. We also got some of the omelets and the nashville hot sandwich but it's not spicy at all, just a heads up."
10-Sep-23,"Loved everything about this place, The food, The atmosphere, The service; everything was great. I most of all enjoyed seeing how everyone worked together to make sure we were well taken care of. Will come back here every time I'm in the area."
9-Sep-23,"First time here on a Saturday morning . Lots of breakfast /Brunch options .   Portions are large , you can share them .Yes it was a little busy  considering the time .You order food and pay , then you sit in dining area .Staff brings food to your table , service was good .Nice vibe .  Will definitely come back here again!"
5-Sep-23,"Cute interior. We had a 35 minute wait for two people on Labor Day. My date and I split the Santa Barbara burger and the ube stuffed French toast. Gotta love the sweet and salty mix. Everything was cooked to perfection. The ube French toast was especially yummy without being cloyingly sweet. We also split the lychee mimosa pitcher which was super delicious. I recommend asking them for ice though as it was chilled but nearing room temperature. There were a bunch of stool high tops which aren't the most comfy, but I guess it fits more tables? Looks like there was another room in the back but maybe they had it closed off because it was a holiday. Perfect spot for out girl's brunch!"
3-Sep-23,"I love places where you get the bill out of the way.  As soon as you walk it above you is the meanie and the cashiers border and take your number and grab a a seat. Perfect for big parties who all want to split a check. The place is small, but really nice inside.  Comfortable seating and really nice staff.  Came to check on us frequently.  The food was delicious.  The omelet had avocado mushrooms and cherry tomatoes inside with spinach.  It was absolutely delicious and with pesto on top.  Super filling.  The potatoes were just perfect.  The salad has a very delicious vinaigrettes. Super light and flavorful.  The French toast was a little sweet but l, still good if you're looking for a crunchy textured French toast. We ate it last so it was cold, but I will be sure to order it again and try it warm.  Comes with whipped cream, but we weren't too  fond of that. Tasted like the one you get in the ice cream trucks.  Nothing wrong with that just wasn't feeling that.  Everything was absolutely delicious. Looking forward to trying the Nashville chicken sandwich next.  Looks delicious."
3-Sep-23,Service was great and the food was yummy. Really liked the French toast crunch! Will definitely return!
29-Aug-23,"Went on a Sunday after lunch time, wait was 15-25 mins, service was excellent. Was quite hot in main dining area. Restrooms very clean. Nashville hot chicken benedict: really looked good, but the chicken was so thin, it was mostly crunchy batter, which tasted like the overly fried potatoes-like old cooking oilJumbo fried calamari: not so jumbo and was gummy, even the batterToffee banana liege waffle-so limp and thin, zero crunch, was not what we were expectingHouse french toast: deep fried breaded bread-tasted like the potatoes and chicken-like old cooking oil. Hardly any condensed milk/syrup. We asked for extra sauce, but was sad it didn't help."
27-Aug-23,"Best speak easy in town, don't tell everyone about it , it has the best breakfast in LA, coffee is ok , but the food is GOOD!!!!"
26-Aug-23,Expensive but a good brunch place! one of the biggest cons is the LONG lines- best to come on weekdays or super early on weekends. The food is pretty filling especially since they pile a lot of potatoes. Overall pretty good but not the best brunch place I've been to.
22-Aug-23,Great atmosphere and decor inside. You order first and then sit down. All of their savory dishes are all some form of an eggs Benedict. Generous portion size with the potatoes and salad.
20-Aug-23,Ordered the apple cinnamon French toast. It was a little too sweet for me. Kind of like a churro and an Apple fritter had a baby. More of a desert item then breakfast. I loved the fact that you could get 1/2 orders. Service was quick and efficient. You order & pay upfront then the food is delivered to your table. Ambiance is very trendy. Seat yourself after you order. Tables are cleaned frequently.
20-Aug-23,"Not as I'd expect it to be. The food was nothing special, this was more of a presentation type of thing. Food was lacking flavor. I honestly thought this was just all precooked food from the markets frozen food section with the exception of the eggs, salad and fresh orange juice.There was nothing fresh about the food we ordered. The bacon was weird too, no authentic bacon flavor and it had a weird taste to it. The sausage links were just about the same, like something you get from the grocery store, in the deli section. Potatoes were a good amount but no flavor whatsoever.Service was not all that either, we were told only certain tables were available and given the option of the bar, outside or a very small table squeezed between other guests there. We chose the outside which was nothing like the inside. The inside was much prettier to look at but it's way too loud that you could barely hear the cashier taking your order. We ended up coming back inside and sat at the bar.We had ordered three meals and only received two of them. Once our food was served, no one ever came by to check on us if we needed anything. I had to stop a waitress to let her know we were still missing an order. I assumed she went to tell some one but I still never got the order. I ended up asking for a refund because by that point my daughter and I were ready to go. Not so sure I'll be coming back here again. It's way overpriced for some items that are clearly not worth it."
18-Aug-23,Great brunch spot. You order your food at the front and grab your own table. It's a cute little restaurant
16-Aug-23,"I was visiting LA with some friends and we decided to go here for Brunch after reading all the amazing reviews. The food and the service was top-tier and came out quickly. You order at the front and then you sit down and they bring everything to you and they consistently check up on you and make sure everything is perfect. Service, food, and ambience was excellent. Would recommend to anyone wanting a tasty brunch. I also enjoyed the Apple cinnamon French toast and it was to die for!"
14-Aug-23,"1.Great hour- opens at 8am, give me time to get yummy food to face long day of work2.Great volume - just order 1 is actually can fill up 2 persons 3.Many services ppl, so not to worry no one responds when you need service 4.Place pretty spacious, not to worry ppl next to you listening to your conversation"
13-Aug-23,Best breakfast place i have ever had ! 10/10 from the way they prepare the food to the taste was great. Nice portions for the price !
9-Aug-23,Hopped off the plane at LAX with my dream and cardigan.. Welcome to land of brunch!! Popping Yolk Cafe was the PERECT brunch spot after we arrived in LA!! I ordered the croissant smoked salmon sandwich and everything about it was so delicious. From the freshly toasted croissant to the abundance of lox to crispy country fried potatoes.. what more could a girl ask for?! Would definitely come back here!!
7-Aug-23,"/)/) ( . .) ( づ  the potatoes weren't fried in the freshest oil and a bit too oily for my taste. The eggs were perfect but were missing flavor and saltiness. My florentine Benedict was very bland, barely tasted the sauce. The waffles were good and so was the crepe. Nothing outstanding here, very solid taste. One egg dish came 20 mins later. Service and ambience was okay. Was a Little disappointed by this place but maybe because I had high expectations. They had a various items on the menu to choose from which I appreciate."
7-Aug-23,One of my go-to brunch places in the area.AMBIENCE:bigger inside than it looks than the outside. Lots of seating. Clean. You pay first/ you sit/ they bring food after. FOOD:Mango ice green tea: Not to sweet. Refillable! Nice and refreshing on a hot day.Mango Habanero Chicken Egg Benedict: nice sight sweetness and kick to it. Would order again. Ube French Toast: I like the crunch. My friend and I couldn't taste the Ube too much. Maybe the syrup and slight fried oilyness overpowered/ was a bit too heavy for us. Nice to try.
6-Aug-23,"We got seated quickly within 15 min at 11am on a Sunday. The wait went by quickly because we just walked around the local farmers market nearby!You order at the front first and they give you a number and tell you where to sit. The tables were all taken so they sat us at the bar. Decor is cute but sitting at the bar kinda ruined the experience. We ordered the Norwegian eggs benedict and house french toast. Both came out very quickly.Norwegian eggs benedict with smoked salmon: 4/5 The English muffin was soft and delicious! Smoked salmon was pretty good too and not fishy at all. Potatoes and salad on the side were mid.Half order of House French Toast: 1/5 It seemed like they deep fried this with a panko crust? It was not good though :( Too heavy and the crust was way too hard and crunchy so it hurt my mouth. We ended up only finishing one out of 3 slices bc it was that bad lolOverall, I wouldn't say this place is bad but I don't think I would come here again :/"
6-Aug-23,It's just not very good. Bad quality. Bad food. Bad potatoes. Bad wilted salad. Over sweet not fresh crepe. Just terrible and unspecial and made with no love. And so expensive. Why are eggs $20?
5-Aug-23,"There were four seats at our table, but even with just the two of us, there was not enough space. The chairs were also really small and uncomfortable. The food definitely made up for it! The Ube French toast was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and just sweet enough. The Nashville chicken sandwich had a little kick to it but was not overpowering. The whole sandwich was made really well, and the egg cooked perfectly. Even the flavors of the side salad worked with everything. The potatoes had good flavor but were a little too crisp in my opinion, couldn't pierce them with my fork, and had to scoop them up."
3-Aug-23,The food is delicious. Service is great and friendly staff. The ambiance is very nice .
2-Aug-23,"I'm wouldn't really call myself a brunch enthusiast, but I do enjoy it occasionally! Popping Yolk Cafe has been on my radar for a while, and I finally got to try it this past Sunday. If you come at peak times, you put your name down on their waitlist and when they tell you your table is ready you go to the front cashier to order & pay first, so it's good to look over the menu while you're waiting to decide on your order.They actually had tables and seats available, but I think they are also a little short-staffed or didn't want to overwhelm their kitchen since it also seemed like they were working on some to-go orders (which is something I may keep in mind for next time!).My husband actually tried Popping Yolk with some co-workers first and brought home his leftover Ube French Toast and my god they were delicious. Not too sweet, topped with blueberries & filled with ube and deep fried (yum!). The deep frying really gives the French Toast this extra dimension in flavor. That's why I decided we should give them a try for real haha!We waited probably about 20 mins. total & ordered a few things to share. Then they give you a number and tell you which table to sit at.-Popping Yolk Burger, I really liked this. Maybe it's nostalgia of having ham/turkey with eggs in a breakfast sandwich growing up, I liked having the runny sunny-side egg with the burger patty and mushrooms. Just needed to add my own ketchup though. The country fried potatoes were good and so was their salad.-Strawberry Cheesecake Crepe, I enjoyed this as well, comes with a small scoop of ice cream and it did get really sweet for me - but I liked the flavor and the cereal bits added a different texture in the bite.-Popcorn Chicken, this was good - tastes just like the old TapEx popcorn chicken. My only gripe is that they don't have fried basil with it and can't change the spice level...if they did then it would literally be *chef's kiss* + ratatouille moment of nostalgia for me. lolRestrooms are clean. They have both indoor and outdoor patio seating. Service was fairly quick. Parking is either street parking or you can park in the free lots over on 1st street (north & south of main street) and walk over. It definitely gets busy at the lunch rush, so coming early is recommended."
29-Jul-23,"I've been waiting here for more than half an hour for brunch, a very unsatisfying experience given the fact that their online systems are down and have to wait longer to get seated. It's very frustrating that they can't resort themselves to accommodating people and orders by hand. You guys need to do better!"
26-Jul-23,Food was amazing! Staff needs to pay attention to what people order. Because they missed mine. Be ready to wait in a line.
25-Jul-23,"I had breakfast here for the first time with my coworker. There was already a few groups waiting to be seated upon our arrival but we were still able to be seated within 10 minutes time. It is a bit on the pricey side but the portions sizes are quite big, so I would say it's worth the price. Food is tasty. The toffee banana French toast was delicious. I didn't care to much for the iced horchata latte I ordered, it was a little too much on the sweet side. Other than that the ambiance, food and service were great."
24-Jul-23,I had been here before I arrived early at 10:00 am and ordered quickly and sat down. I got the eggs and bacon Benedict and avocado Benedict they everything was tasty.
23-Jul-23,Great food and good service! The ambiance was nice. A bit loud and i had a hard time hearing other people in my group.
23-Jul-23,Love this place! Definitely my go to breakfast spot! The waffles are always perfect and the fresh fruit on top is always a great topping! Staff is friendly and professional. I also would like to say the portions are very generous which is always a plus
22-Jul-23,"The food is decent but not extraordinary. I'm from NYC area so this place pales in comparison with the myriad of creative and delicious breakfast and brunch venues in the big apple. Service is where the negatives comes in. The seating is first come first serve, so after we ordered the front desk staff told us that we could sit anywhere we want. There were high tops which would be uncomfortable for me in high heels and regular tables and chairs. We waited for a table to be cleared and set up for us and got seated. Soon after we sat down we were told to pick another seating because the staff wanted to accommodate a larger party size and needed our table. By this time there were only high tops left and they were all wobbly. We asked the front desk staff for help and let him know that we're are willing to wait for the next table seating. Front desk staff gave us the option to cancel our order or to wait in line again (over 45 min wait) and start all over and maybe a table will open up. I told him that it was unfair to make us give up our table for another party without helping us finding another acceptable seating. He pretty much ignored us, his response was irresponsible,  insensitive, and rude. I went back to my table and told the wait staff that we are staying and the larger party can wait their turn for a table just as we waited for ours. I saw a couple of wait staff in the back huddled to figure out how to accommodate the larger party and solved the issue. The front desk staff never apologized or acknowledged the problem, an example of terrible customer service. The back wait staff basically saved his butt. Though I'm grateful that the back wait staff accommodated us and didn't make us leave our table again, it was an unpleasant experience and I will not go back there again when there are so many other choices with better customer service. Tasty food is great, but service quality is important especially we are all paying a premium thanks to inflation across the board post pandemic. I did leave extra tips for the wait staff upon leaving."
19-Jul-23,"Service was not great, the front desk lady was rushing us through our order even though there wasn't much of a line.We ordered BBQ Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, Hazelnut Coffee, Vanilla Coffee, Cajun Fries, and Toffee Banana Liege Waffles.The good:The waffles and hazelnut coffee were okay. Nothing to write home about but we still enjoyed it. Ambiance was also nothing special, just felt like a typical brunch spot. Again nothing to complain about.The bad:On the other hand the vanilla coffee came with no vanilla flavoring/syrup. Cajun fries has no flavor to them, just seemed like cayenne/paprika sprinkled on with no other seasonings. The fries were just bland and slightly spicy.The eggs benedict were the bright spot up until our last few bites which included lots of egg shells (pictured.) I find it ironic that a place that specializes in eggs also managed to incorporate in egg shells into the dish.With that said, the food was very slightly pricey ranging from $15-$19 for an entree. I would have no problem with the price if everything was just slightly better. Ambiance, service, food, ect...Pasadena location is MUCH better. Would recommend driving a litter further for that location."
18-Jul-23,"Loved this place. Came across it by accident but such a nice accident. Different set up... slightly chaotic, but nice. Loved the food first time out take several people with you order different things so you can all taste the various things they have."
16-Jul-23,"It's been awhile since my last visit, food quality remains the same, onion rings are a bit too salty. Maybe it's close to closing time, staffs are not very attentive, I had to walk up to the bar twice to get my water refilled.Ambiance didn't change, nothing special to mention"
16-Jul-23,"My friend and I went there for breakfast on a Saturday. The place was not as busy and we didn't have to wait too long for a table. I ordered the French toast with a side of eggs, and my friends ordered the croissant with salmon. My French toast was deep fried, it felt like they literally had it frozen and just fried it before serving it. It was super oily like something you would buy at a carnival. My friend's croissant was okay."
15-Jul-23,"I drove from far and arrived at 2pm, which was 1 hour before their designated closing time. The cashier suddenly told us that they are short staffed so can only allow take out starting at 2pm. However, it's still 1 hour from the closing time. The cashier helped to ask the manager Vicky if we can still dine in if we promise to finish by 3pm, and the manager still won't allow it. This is non-acceptable cause it's just one hour before and they didn't even post anything on the door or on the site. This is my first time and it will be my last time coming here. Service needs to be improved."
11-Jul-23,"Came here for a friends brunch and food was pretty darn good. It was most definitely surprising to find the very unique options for common breakfast favorites, but in a good way. Service was quick and easy, ambiance was great, but was not a fan of order ahead and sit down at a table that's available. It does not guarantee that when you order that you'll have a table so be aware."
10-Jul-23,The bff and I came in for brunch one fine afternoon. Popping Yolk Cafe is located in the heart of downtown Alhambra. Order at the counter and find some available seating. On this particular visit we ordered the pulled pork benedict (definitely recommend!) and the croissant avocado and ham sandwich. Everything was cooked to perfection. Portions are large with reasonable prices. Service was great although they did get a table or two confused.There is plenty of free structure and street parking available. If you are looking for a great brunch spot then check them out.
7-Jul-23,"pre-tipping apparently won't get you service. Condiments were missing,  missed chances for upsales, and sadly didn't get checked up on. Each table is to each their own especially after a mandatory 3% service charge. On top of tipping before you sit."
6-Jul-23,"I had a fantastic brunch experience at Popping Yolk cafe. The highlight was definitely the Ube French toast, which was both delicious and crispy. The way the ube melted in my mouth made it a must-try dish. Additionally, the service was excellent as the server promptly attended to me when I checked in with the tablet, ensuring that I was seated immediately."
5-Jul-23,"Presentation great, flavor missing on the food. The latte was pretty good. It's a trendy little spot, overpriced for reason being I had to put a pound of salt and cholula to try and help the chicken out. The English muffin underneath was about as hard as the plate it was sitting on. I rarely leave low star reviews but I hate paying for bad food. Service was good, they were nice and friendly. Wait was 45 minutes for 2 people but moved along about 15 minutes sooner"
4-Jul-23,"The trip here was unexpected as the place we were eyeing was closed but, we were glad because Popping Yolk exceeded our expectations!The place was clean, interiors were cute too! The lady assigned to us made sure we have everything we need and was attentive to our needs (water, napkins, etc). The place has good music, not too loud.Food: I love ube, and their take to ube french toast was 10/10. It was not too sweet but flavorful! It was crunchy and not oily. The eggs benedict with chicken was also cooked to perfection! The salad and potatoes that came with it tasted good too. Lastly, the seasoned fries was a bit spicy but I didn't mind.I am overall happy with our brunch."
4-Jul-23,Tried this after moving into the area. The hot chicken Benedict is a large plate plan on sharing it. Great!Also tried the Salmon omelette it was good but need. Little pizzaz! Good.I am a big fan of the horchata latte. Very good.Only missing star is the fact you counter order and not a server.
4-Jul-23,"The food and service is pretty good, too expensive for what it is, but what isn't these days?"
2-Jul-23,"Rating: 9.5/10My all-time favorite brunch place!!! Popping Yolk is an aesthetic casual brunch restaurant with generous portions and many delicious options to try.I've been here many times with different friend and family members, and there has never been a time where I've been disappointed. Wait can be long depending on day and time, but weekdays are usually not as busy and weekends around 12-1PM are packed. Service is great and most of the staff are on the younger side. They are extremely friendly and quick on their feet. You order at the front and pay before taking a seat and waiting for your food to come out.Here are my favorite items that I usually get:1) Classic Eggs Benedict: 9.5/10. Sooo delicious!!!! Popping Yolk has my favorite Eggs Bennie EVER. The eggs are always perfectly runny and the hollandaise sauce has a slightly tangy and rich taste that complement the salty ham and bacon. Potatoes and salad are also so delicious, with the potatoes being soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside and salad having a fresh and tangy citrus vinaigrette. Great choice for those looking for a classic brunch spread.2) Cowboy Burger: 9.5/10. Great option for those who do not prefer breakfast or brunch foods! My boyfriend normally gets the burgers here at Popping Yolk and loves them since they are huge and meaty. I got it my last visit a few days ago and it hit the meat craving I had. Egg was jammy inside, not runny, but I don't mind so I still loved it all the same. Meat was perfectly cooked through but tender and juicy, surrounded by a fluffy bun.3) House French Toast: 9.5/10. Light and crispy, not too sweet but fulfills that sweet craving that comes when eating salty foods. I almost always order a half portion to share since I like to have sweet foods in between bites of salty food. Although the toast is deep-fried, it does not taste oily at all and honestly is the best French toast I've ever had.I've had a few of the other eggs benedict variations but always go back to classic one for the taste and price. Overall, amazing place to have brunch with great food, portions, price, service, and ambiance. Highly recommend since this is one of my go-to's in the 626!"
29-Jun-23,Came by for brunch on a weekday and it was still pretty crowded. You first order your items at the counter once you walk in and them get seated. The food came out relatively quick but the toast took a while so we took it togo to eat instead which I don't recommend because it gets soggy!
28-Jun-23,"Was in the area for some work. Happened to stumble in to another location of popping yolk so defiantly had to try again.I ordered classic Benedict with vanllia lattte, and I must say, they never fail to impress. The ham and egg combination was savory, perfectly complemented with buttery hollandaise sauce. The dish was served with crunchy country potatoes, adding a texture to the overall experience. Latte was good but a bit sweet for me, should have asked for less sugar, no big deal. Service is always friendly and quick. Ambiance is bright, and relaxing with nice touch of background music. If you are in the area definitely check out this spot. Personally had great experience and will be back again."
28-Jun-23,Going down Main St in Alhambra. Poppin Yolk caught our eyes early in the morning for breakfast. Parking we found on the street. There were no lines. We ordered and sat in an open table. It was almost filled with 2 tables left. We ordered French toast and a ham and cheese omelet. They came not long after we sat down. It was a pleasant atmosphere and the staff were very helpful.
28-Jun-23,"Hands down, the crunchy banana toffee French toast was the best French toast I've ever had. Holy smokes! We also shared the bfast sandwich and classic bfast. Eggs were fluffed to perfection, everything tasted fresh and made with love, potatoes were perfectly crispy, and the salad accompaniment was a delight. Only wish there was better iced coffee. Don't pass this place up!"
27-Jun-23,"Oh my goodness what a treat!! Was in town on business - wish they had one in NY!! GREAT menu - unusual, great idea menu options! I felt like something sweet and has the waffle and berries. It did not need whipped cream or extra sweet sauces - but that's up to you.  Salad with breakfast is a great idea - especially when it is so fresh. They have a super sonic fresh oj juicer - amazing. Order at the counter, more than fair prices, great value and service - and very comfortable atmosphere. Will be a destination breakfast when I'm back in town."
27-Jun-23,Came here  in the afternoon to enjoy brunch for my daughter's birthday.    Great food and friendly people.   My California Omelette was delicious!!   Convenient parking across  the street from Starbucks.
26-Jun-23,"Cashier was very rude would not let me and service dog eat. When I told him it's a service dog he said he ""doesn't care"" and it's still a dog. Would not recommend to anyone who needs a service animal as they clearly ""don't care"". I offered to take my food to go and the guy way eyeing me up and down and giving me a rude unwanted and unnessacry stare like I was pissing him off / wasting his time. Didn't feel welcomed at all and will never come back due to the treatment of the cashier."
25-Jun-23,"I had been meaning to try this place for a while and finally got the chance. It always has a wait so I thought I was in for something great. I was surprised that you order like at Chik fil A and then they bring you your plate. I would think that would bring down the cost but they charge as if it is a true sit down serve restaurant. we ordered the hot chicken benedict and the berry crepe. Both dishes were good but very rich. I felt it course through my arteries. Of course, my own fault for ordering this. My benedict had thin fried cutlets with mor crunchy breading than chicken breast. Hollandaise was ok. My niece said the berry crepe was good but sweet. Neither of us were able to finish the large portions. Portions great, service was like fast food but you still tip like a regular restaurant. maybe a place every now and then but not going into regular rotation from my standpoint"
24-Jun-23,Around 30 for one person Will come back another day !so relaxing environment and food yumm!
24-Jun-23,"I've came to this location multiple times and every time is an amazing experience. I suggest coming on a weekday for the reason that they get pretty busy on Saturday's and Sunday's (but the wait is worth it). Food: I ordered a bacon and cheese sandwich and a half order of the toffee banana french toast (3 pieces) and both were delicious. The sandwich comes with a generous portion of country fried potatoes and house salad which are both good. Service: The service is amazing, all the staff are attentive and are friendly. They answer any questions you have with their honest opinions. They also come around multiple times asking if you need anything else, they also ask if you need any refills on any of their refillable drinks. I plan on coming back and trying other dishes that sound amazing."
23-Jun-23,"This place has some good points and some bad. The good was the croissant egg sandwich and Florentine Benedict items. The bad was the rest of the items on the plate especially the greasy overdone potatoes. I had the feeling that there was not much customer focus in the food, service and ambiance; more focus on profitability. Service was ok but minimal. Servers are not incentivized to provide extraordinary service because you tip before you get food.The abundant overcooked potatoes seems like it was a low cost side that fills the plate out and is a way of disposing of old oil, a most profitable way of disposing of much used oil.The creamer container were haphazardly put in the basket that you can't help noticing in your face, and the TV are good but only visible to half the restaurant. Small stuff but shows lack of customer focus attention to detail."
23-Jun-23,"Food was great, the service was quick. We got seated in 5-10 mins. The ambiance is family friendly with music in the back ground. Overall recommend for a light brunch w/ mimosas available"
21-Jun-23,"We are locals and visited for the first time during a slow weekday. Food was decent, minus the dry, quickly thrown together side salad with canned corn on it. The service was... well there was no service after our food was delivered to our table. None of the employees seemed to care about any of the customers after their food was at their tables and that's probably because they got their tip prior to serving the table. I wouldn't have left more than a dollar in the tip box after for our visit. We watched table after table leave as we were eating and the young guys working chatted it up while sweeping... no acknowledgment or thank you's to anyone the whole time. In summary, the food wasn't spectacular but decent for brunch + we felt a bit ripped off by leaving a good tip after ordering. Best to bring cash and tip after done eating."
18-Jun-23,"Wow its been 3 years since ive been here! Last time i was around was right before covid lockdown. I was around the area and dropped in for a quick bite - its nice to see familiar name / faces after the last 3 years. They're not your typical west hollywood brunch spot obviously where the food is decorated on the prettiest plates, nicest presentation, but also this is not the neighborhood to expect that anyway. Its in the suburbs. And its reliable, its consistent, and its comforting. I know what I can expect and I'm pretty content. This location can get busy! So look at the menu in advance & safe urself the wait time. My go to is their eggs benedict with freshly squeezed orange juice!"
18-Jun-23,"Heard a lot about this place and finally decided to visit on a Sunday morning with our 1-year and 3-year old. Parking is easy considering the time we went was early.  They had an tablet outside served as a waitlist, and there were two parties ahead of us. About 15 mins in, we got a text saying it's our turn, and things went south from there. As my wife was getting the kids in, I was told we needed to order and pay first which was totally fine, but just as I started looking at the menu, the person behind me said he was ready to order, and the waiter just skipped me without even asking and started taking order from the person behind me. Turns out it's a 10 people group, and I was just left there standing for another 15 minutes while my wife and kids kept starved. After finally ordered our food, another waitress came by to help, and the guy who took my order told her right in front of my face that the 10 people group WAS NOT even on the waitlist, and the waiter let them go in first simply because they went straight inside. Very interesting, if that's the case, then what's the point of having a waitlist outside????? Additionally, we paid good tips upfront so that I could investigate and locate a high chair at a strange corner myself and had to ask multiple times for just water, and still the food came out missing dressing for the salad and chicken overcooked. They did a such good job popping nothing but our nerves."
18-Jun-23,"I support many local restaurants. Disappointed I was lied to my face. I ordered online (through Uber Eats), was given an ETA of 10:37am, that ETA got changed to 10:47am - I spoke to Uber Eats and it's something manually triggered by the restaurant. I showed up at 11am and employee at the front said the order wasn't ready, used a walkie talkie to speak to someone managing the kitchen. The order wasn't started because they didn't confirm it on their end of the app but I was told they never received the order - a lie. I asked for a refund, and the employee said it had to be done through the Uber Eats app. As a novice user, I didn't know where to go to cancel the order, I handed my phone to the employee and watched her stumble around to find ""cancel order"" and clicked on it... Guess what, I got charged a cancellation fee. So I had to contact Uber Eats to explain, and supposedly they will not charge me but that will take 3-5 business days. Look I get it, it sucks when it's super busy, and maybe my bad for clicking on the wrong 3rd party to order because clearly Uber Eats holds no clout to Popping Yolk. But don't lie to me... and the restaurant should cancel the order, not the customer. See you again when I see you."
18-Jun-23,"My recent experience at Popping Yoke left me with mixed feelings. While the food was decent, I couldn't help but feel that the prices were on the higher side, considering the overall quality of the dishes. I ordered my eggs over medium, hoping for that perfect runny yolk, but unfortunately, they were fully cooked through. This lack of a runny yolk diminished the enjoyment of the dish for me. However, I must admit that the orange juice I had was the highlight of my visit. It was flavorful and refreshing, and definitely something worth mentioning.However, I wasn't a fan of the French toast at Popping Yoke due to its funnel cake-like texture, it seemed to be a popular choice among other customers. I would encourage those with an adventurous palate to give it a shot, as it might offer a unique and enjoyable twist on the traditional French toast experience.Despite the satisfactory taste of the food, I couldn't shake the feeling that the prices didn't align with the overall experience. The cost seemed a bit too high for what was delivered. As a result, I don't believe I'll be returning to Popping Yoke in the future.In conclusion, while the food at Popping Yoke was decent, I found the prices to be somewhat inflated compared to the quality of the dishes. The lack of a runny yolk in my order was disappointing, but the standout element was the delicious orange juice. Taking everything into consideration, I don't see myself revisiting Popping Yoke anytime soon."
12-Jun-23,"First off, their food is delicious. The eggs Benedict and chicken sandwich is a must. The egg is always cooked to perfection. The chicken sandwich is crispy and not over breaded. The potatoes are always perfect. It's fried to the point where it's almost overdone but it's not. The guy at the register is not very helpful. He asked the couple in front of us if they preferred sitting inside or outside but didn't ask us. We requested to sit inside because we already knew we didn't like he outdoor seating. The outdoor seating smells like trash and has a bunch of flies. We ended up asking to be moved to the bar where we get to stare at dirty dishes. The guy with the shaved head and piercing was super nice. He moved us to a table so we would be more comfortable."
10-Jun-23,The popping yolk cafe took a long time to get us seated. the service was bad but they were fast with the drink. The outdoor seats were bad and some seats were in the garage. The food was okay but I have had better. The chicken was quite spicy. At the end of the dinner we we're waiting for the waiter because we wanted the check and when the waiter came he said we forgot about you and didn't even say sorry. The place had a busy and kinda of a mean vibe.
9-Jun-23,"Visited this place for a birthday brunch. We had a 40 minute wait outside, but that was expected knowing the popularity of this place. We ordered at the counter and once we were seated, the service was relatively quick! Very large portions, and I especially liked how my Benedict was not drenched and drowning in the hollandaise sauce, which is what I've typically seen in other places. I loved the nice balance of eggs, potatoes, and greens! One thing that makes this. 4 star than a 5 star is that we were seated outside, and there were so many flies... we had to keep swatting them away as we were trying to eat, so that was a little inconvenient. It would have been the perfect experience if there was something done to the get rid of the flies on the outside patio."
7-Jun-23,I've been to their other branch somewhere close to West Covina and that branch is waaay better than Alhambra branch. Their food is way more fresh. I ordered the eggs benedict here and the potatoes looked like it has been refried 10x. The service there is also better than Alhambra's. No one even bothered to ask after i got my order if I needed anything else. The girl who brought my ordered ( not exaggerating) literally just dumped the plate in front of me and walked away. The Ambiance obviously didn't feel as welcoming as the other branch.
6-Jun-23,"I recently had breakfast here, and I must say, it was quite underwhelming. The prices were on the high side for what turned out to be a very average breakfast. The food lacked any remarkable flavors or creativity. Moreover, the service was slow, leading to long waits before we were even seated. As if that wasn't disappointing enough, the exterior of the restaurant was extremely dirty and neglected, which didn't leave a good impression. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place for breakfast. There are certainly better options available that offer tastier meals, faster service, and cleaner surroundings."
3-Jun-23,"Our last day in Alhambra, we decided to get brunch out (plus we were out of food at the Airbnb)A quick Yelp search revealed this place with over a thousand reviews and 4-1/2 stars!    That, and the fact that it was a mile from our place made it a no brainer.   Interesting place/decor kind of ""sparse modern/industrial"", it was cool, clean, and well lit.   Order from the counter and they'll bring your goodies to you.    This place is a bit on the pricey side.    Nothing crazy, but you're looking at $25 per person.   I had the bbq pulled pork omelette with potatoes and salad greens.    The omelette was good, although the center was a bit runny, I also didn't like the mushrooms on the omelette (my fault, I'm just not a huge fan of mushrooms), but didn't expect the dish to be that 'mushroom intense'.    Potatoes were delicious and addicting, salad was light, very nice, and tasty.   Overall good, maybe not their best item.  The French toast was wild!   Deep fried with a crunchy batter on the outside and made with condensed milk and creamy-sweet.   Fantastic.  Half order was plenty, whether sharing or going solo.   Overall a great, great place.   I'd order differently next time either no mushrooms or a different item, but no regrets."
1-Jun-23,"Parking: street parkingAmbiance: trendy, open and funService: decent but it gets veryyy busy and can be hard to get helpFood: it's okay. nothing to rave about but i don't regret going. dined about 3 times here and i'd probably go back for convenience instead of cravingsUbe french toast:  we were suppper excited about this but was a bit disappointed. the ube filing in the middle was underwhelming and didn't pack a strong ube taste, which is what i prefer. there were also a few bites of the toast that was full of oil and it deterred us from finishing it  Hot chicken Benny: my husband really enjoyed this! we like that we can choose how spicy it is and the meal was generously proportionedSalmon Benny: it's like any average benny. nothing special but also not fishy (which i hate). i really really enjoy the salad so i usually ask for no potatoes and extra saladit's overall a solid place to go for brunch with friends but never at the top of our minds"
1-Jun-23,"Popping yolk is popping up everwhere in socal and I am not a fan.  It's trying hard to be good with its great hip sounding menu items, but it's just mediocre and cheap tasting.  Low quality for high prices is what it feels like.  You can tell the potatoes are machine cut and frozen, they're all tiny and the same size.The waffle tastes like the individually packaged sweet waffles you see at some grocery stores or bakeries.  And it was SO sweet for being a ""plain waffle"".Got the burger with over easy egg on top and the burger was so full of gristle and fat I had trouble eating it.Eggs benedict was no better.  The ham is paper thin deli meat and they barely put a slice on whatever you order that says ""ham""...I've given this 3 chances (1 in Hacienda Heights & 2 in Pasadena) and I will not go back.  Breakfast isn't an easy thing to mess up imo, but they found a way to do it."
31-May-23,"Came here for Memorial Day brunch, you have to get on the waitlist when you arrive so we ended up waiting 45 min. Large portions for Benedict dishes make this great for those who are looking for a hearty brunch. Poached eggs are well made and I'm in love with hollandaise sauce. Potatoes were crispy, crunchy but still soft on inside. Salad vinaigrette was great. We got the Nashville hot chicken Benedict which was mild, could be hotter for those who like spicier chicken. I wish the fish fillet Benedict came with more Tartar sauce!!Ube toast was deep fried I think, which wasn't what I would've expected. It was great though, the chewiness of it almost reminded me of Mochi"
30-May-23,"It's is a cute IG place to visit. Wasn't impressed buy the food, I tried the toffee banana liege waffles. The waffles were very plain, if it weren't for the whipped cream and ice cream it came with it would have no flavor. I will say the mimosas are the best I've had anywhere. I'm not sure if it's the fresh squeezed Orange juice or the actual champagne, but I would go back just for them. It is a popular place so get there early or make sure you have a mini snack before going."
30-May-23,"Great little brunch spot on Main street! Although I tried to avoid brunching/lunching here on the weekends, sometimes you just gotta give in and wait! Yes, they typically have a wait longer on the weekends... Especially since they close at 3pm and the area is bustling with people. Also, If you're lucky, you might come up on street parking. However, don't be discouraged with the limited street parking. There are free parking lots around the area. Now, I've been to this establishment a couple times on the weekdays. On the weekday, the seating is limited to indoor dining only. They have tables, communal tables, high tables and bar seating. Apparently on the weekends, they open the back patio for seating. I have not seen the back patio as they were closed the past weekend I was there. It was a little disappointing...So, we put our name on the waitlist and waited for a text. I received a text that said, ""high table or bar table."" I walked inside and spoke with the host/cashier stating that I preferred a regular table. We ordered with the host/cashier first, paid, and got a number before being seated.As for the food, here are the things I've tried...* Classic Breakfast: 5/5 - As long as you're not sleeping on the job, It's hard to get this wrong! It comes with 2 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, a piece of toast, side salad, and crispy homestyle potatoes. * Fish Filet Benedict: 4/5 - Fish was crispy, eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise sauce was creamy. The coleslaw wasn't my fav. It was ok... It also comes with a side salad and crispy homestyle potatoes. * Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict: 4/5- The chicken was crispy,  eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise sauce was creamy. The hotsauce wasn't my fav. Next time, I would ask for it on the side. It also comes with a side salad and crispy homestyle potatoes. * Norwegian Benedict: 4/5 - Smoked salmon was good, eggs were perfectly poached, and the hollandaise sauce was creamy. It also comes with a side salad and crispy homestyle potatoes. * Ube French Toast: 5/5 - If you're an ube fanatic like me, it's a must have! It's crispy on the outside and has deliciousness inside. The ube paste inside the toast and the ube condense milk does EVERYTHING!* Toffee Banana French Toast: 4/5 - It was good but you gotta really like bananas. I really didn't get much of the toffee flavor as the banana flavor overpowered it. Still good~* House French Toast: 5/5 - This is my go-to for french toast. I love the berries that comes with it!* Regular coffee: 4/5 - Dark roast coffee... * Ice horchata latte: 4/5 - It's decent but grainy with a hint of horchata flavor.* Hazelnut latte: 4/5 - Nothing spectacular but I was VERY disappointed that they don't refill with regular coffee after. Refills are ONLY for regular coffee. Fun fact: This restaurant is supposedly women own and operated. In the past, I've only seen women servers/employees. Over the past weekend, I finally saw male servers/employees. I was glad that employment opportunities are open to both genders."
28-May-23,Not worth the money and 40 min wait. My friend and I stopped by to get Sunday brunch. Both of us got egg Benedict. The food was cold and not very tasty. The poached egg and English muffin were both served cold. It must have been premade. And salad was served with tiny bit of dressing sprinkled on top. I wouldn't eat dried out veggies like that. My friend's dish was the same way. And both felt the same way. Just pay a little more and eat at Urth Caffé or somewhere near old town Pasadena for this type of brunch.
27-May-23,"Food was delicious... Service was great.  Outdoor area was poor in that fruit flies were all over; there were fruit flies on my food and drink.... Had a difficult time trying to keep them away and several landed on my food and drinks... Twice my orange juice and coffee had to be replaced... Owner can do a better job ensuring flies/ pest are kept out of the outdoor eating area.... Guests could be seen trying to protect their food and drinks.... But again, food and service was excellent ...."
25-May-23,"Compared to Yang's kitchen, the wait time is not that long. I don't usually go for American brunch places but a lot of people rave about this place. We got to share the house french toast and the norwegian benedict. Norwegian benedict was a 6/10, above average and pretty good, would get it again, but the yolk was a little overdone.French Toast was a 7/10. I think it's better because the breading was more unique than I've had at other places in that it created like a crushed chips like texture, brittle, crispy, barely noticeable, and doesn't feel like you're eating something shallow fried. I quite enjoyed it.Fries tasted pretty good as well, they just gave you a lot of it ."
22-May-23,"There was a ~30 minutes wait time on Saturday morning. The wait-list and check in system the cafe uses is convenient and efficient. Once it was our turn, we placed our order at the front counter before grabbing a table. We ordered an extra spicy Nashville Hot Chicken Benedicts and an Ube French Toast. The food were served in about 15 minutes despite the busy atmosphere. The Egg Benedict was perfectly cooked, the chicken is crunchy with a kick, combined with a refreshing mix of salad and perfectly fried potatoes. The Ube French toast tastes almost like a warm, fresh, and slightly crunchy funnel cake. Everything was delicious!"
22-May-23,"Ordered a strawberry cheesecake crepe and it was the worst crepe I have ever had. Tasted like those premade ones they sell at the store, cold and hard. Only one crepe with Waaay to much cream cheese and whip cream. Horrible. Husband ordered the apple cinnamon French toast and it's like eating a churro hard and dry. Nothing like a French toast. Also ordered the Nashville chicken Benedict and that was very good. This was 60 dollars to include 2 coffees. I would never come again."
21-May-23,Definitely would recommend this place for brunch. We tried the Nashville chicken Benedict and Smoked Salmon Sandwhich. Portions were a good size. We did wait since it was a Saturday but there's lots of shops to check out since it's located in Oldtown Pasadena. We parked at a near by parking garage since it difficult to find street parking. Service was good. Just wished our table was right by the line.
21-May-23,"This place in Alhambra is great for breakfast! We met up with a couple of friends. We got the Avocado Benedict, Croissant Avocado & Ham Sandwich, Norwegian Benedict, California Omelette & the Kimchi Spam Omelette. Everything came out tasting fantastic! The inside was a nice space. But a lot of table tops were crammed together. It's was Sunday and it was a packed house. The waiter were friendly and fast. I would definitely go back if I'm near Alhambra."
21-May-23,This is such a cute brunch spot in Alhambra! I came here on a Saturday morning around 8:30am and there was no wait. By the time I was doing eating around 9:30-10 there was a long line outside. I ordered the Nashville chicken eggs Benedict and the portion is HUGE. I could have shared it honestly. The chicken was juicy and not dry which is perfect! Some places make their chicken super dry but not here. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection. I'll def be coming back!
21-May-23,"The food here is great! Make sure you check out the menu either while you're in line or before you get here as you need to order before being seated. The lines can get pretty long, especially on the weekends, so be prepared to wait! I recommend the house French toast, it's very crispy and not too sweet."
18-May-23,"The food was flavorful.  The serving size of the food was a huge.  The potato hash brown was crispy and yummy.  Price is good for the amount of food they give you.   Service was ok, we had to flag them down a few times to get refills of water and coffee.  The ambiance is the place was alright, it's good for gathering."
17-May-23,"Brunch food is solid here! We went for Mothers Day brunch and ordered omelets, egg benedicts, and the caramel apple French toast...and an amazing Earl Grey latte. Love that most of their meals have potatoes and a small salad. Only downside: you have to order before you get seated. The cashier didn't get our complete order, so we were waiting for food that hadn't been charged! Make sure to ask the cashier to repeat your order. Other than that, the place is cute and casual with lots of little plants and is perfect for a chill brunch."
17-May-23,Literally one of my favorite brunch places. The prices are a bit high but the food is always delicious.
17-May-23,"My friend and I came here on a Friday morning for breakfast and wow. It's been a fews already since we've come back from our trip, but I am still thinking about this Ube French Toast. I love the fact that you order and pay before you sit because you can leave whenever you want. The food came out super fast and the place was nice and clean. Service was great and everyone was extremely kind."
14-May-23,"The breakfast is delicious!! The portions are shareable , and everything tastes fresh !! One of my favorite spots"
14-May-23,"The food is absolutely wonderful! Took my wife there for Mother's Day brunch and the mimosa bottle option was reasonably priced and when she took her first bite of the classic eggs Benedict, her look of satisfaction almost made me jealous! The food is THAT good. Portion size is great, too! My only issue is I highly recommend NOT eating in the back outside area. I'm actually surprised the health department allows it. There are two sewer manhole covers smack dab in the center of the area and the bugs are just awful. I must have killed at least half a dozen gnats and they had a couple of those floater fly hybrid things just buzzing around constantly. They need to build out a low deck and seal the manhole covers or something. Caught a couple whiffs of raw sewage too while we were eating. Not pleasant at all. We will definitely go back, but will never eat outside again. If you eat there, it will be worth the wait to wait for indoor seating. The food and the waitlist system is fantastic. Highly recommend, but DO NOT eat outside (you've been warned)."
13-May-23,"This is a great brunch spot in Alhambra. Good food and ample menu options. The vibe is chill with inside and outside seating, including a counter. They're located next door to Boiling Crab. Look for a yellow building.Upon entering, you order your food and drinks at the counter. Number is given which you'll take to your table. Service was on point. Our server came by regularly to refill our coffee and water.We loved everything we got. Norwegian Benedict was stellar. Eggs were poached right, salmon and hollandaise sauce was excellent. Popping Yolk Breakfast was fabulous. It's your typical classic break done right server with salad and huge mounds of country fried potatoes. Both bacon and sausage had slight sweetness from maple syrup, which I enjoyed. Sometimes you want a breakfast that's filling, delicious, and a little indulgent. Their toffee banana french toast checks all of those boxes. So yummy! I am a huge fan of Classic French Toast, but I must say that adding cereal crusted crunchiness to the outside just takes it to the next level. The entire dining experience was wonderful and I officially added this place to my list of comfort spots in Alhambra. I would highly recommend this restaurant to all."
13-May-23,"The Norwegian Benedict was 5/5, I highly recommend it, and It comes with salad and potatoes. My girlfriend got the Ube French Toast, which was a bit of a letdown because we couldn't really taste the ube, I could only taste the deep-fried toast. If you have a low tolerance for oily foods, I'd recommend skipping it.I would definitely come back to try some of their other dishes. You have to order up front before being seated. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Make sure to get on the yelp waitlist on days you expect them to be busy. There's street parking everywhere."
13-May-23,"Time to spill the beans on Popping Yolk Cafe!  We grubbed on their Norwegian Benedict and Ube French Toast, and here's the scoop:First things first, the Norwegian Benedict ($19) was a total winner!  It was so dang good and HUGE. Seriously, you'll need backup to finish that bad boy. The salmon was pure perfection! But hold up, let's talk about the Ube French Toast ($13.5).  It was a major letdown. They straight up fried it to oblivion, and all I could taste was oil. No Ube flavor in sight!  Not gonna lie, it was a total waste of dough. Skip it like you're skipping leg day at the gym, trust me.Oh, and brace yourself for the waiting game.  Getting a table wasn't too bad, even on a weekend, but once we sat our butts down, we twiddled our thumbs for a good 30 minutes before food magically appeared.But gotta give props where they're due. The atmosphere and vibes were on fleek!  The place had a chill, cozy feel that's perfect for catching up with friends or just enjoying a laid-back meal.All in all, Popping Yolk Cafe had its ups and downs. Norwegian Benedict rocked my world, but the Ube French Toast left me feeling like . Service could use a turbo boost, but the ambiance totally saved the day. Give it a shot if you're hunting for a bomb breakfast joint. Just don't waste your cash on that sad Ube French Toast, and explore other drool-worthy options on the menu."
13-May-23,"The food was sooo good. We had the toffee banana french toast and classic breakfast. The french toast was unique, deep fried french toast. The service was an A+, they were very attentive. We really like the set-up of purchasing your food and then finding a seat. Great place to try if your in the area."
12-May-23,It's one of the best food I have ever eaten and I'm really glad I got to eat that food because it's so delicious thank you
12-May-23,"I only had it one time and I didn't like it sorry. The service was lacking, the food was cold, and not very tasty."
9-May-23,The staff was friendly. Service was quick. The food was good. The apple French toast was the favorite. Kimchi Spam Omelette was unique. Nashville hot chicken sandwich didn't have any spice and was just ok. Everything comes with potatoes which were delicious. Love that they have fresh squeezed OJ.
3-May-23,"Nice little place, food was delicious and the mimosa hit the spot   Avocado BenedictHouse French Toast"
3-May-23,"We all know by now that Popping Yolk is the ""it girl"" of brunch spots (at least in the San Gabriel Valley). The staff is friendly and quick to the point when it comes to delivering food and beverages. The food, although pricey, is delicious and very filling. Neither my partner or I weren't able to finish our plates (in a good way, of course). We both ordered the Norwegian Benedict (smoked salmon eggs Benedict with sides of country potatoes and house salad). In terms of drinks, my partner ordered the hazelnut latte (not too sweet) and I ordered the refillable passion fruit green tea (great balance between bitter green tea and the sweet fruit). All in all, we will be returning very soon!"
2-May-23,Ordered the full size house French toast and mimosa. Don't really understand the hype with the crispy texture. Tasted like panko and probably would have preferred regular french toast. Berries were fresh and delicious though.
29-Apr-23,"Really great food. At first I thought it was overpriced but they give large portions, so it's pretty fair. The crunchy French toast were great as were the benedicts"
28-Apr-23,"This place never disappoints! My favorite things about this place is their freshly squeezed orange juice, shareable portions, fast and courteous service. It is a busy restaurant but I am able to have informal work meetings over a latte."
23-Apr-23,I like it here. They have a good selection and the portions are big. The three of us shared two orders:  pulled pork benedict and smoked salmon omelette. Both come with side of salad and potatoes. It's quite filling.
22-Apr-23,"Cool brunch spot on Main Street.. Prices are a little high, but they do give you a lot of food. Service was good too. I'll be returning when I'm in the area."
18-Apr-23,"First time trying popping yolk and I'm a fan! We ordered the norwaigan benedict, Nashville hot chicken Benedict and the ube French toast. Everything was so good! The hot chicken benedict was fried to perfection. Super crispy and juicy. The ube French toast surprised me the most - it's deep-fried, crunchy, filled with ube and drizzled with maple syrup and condensed milk. Literally one of the best French toasts I've ever tasted. Definitely will be adding this to my list of brunch places!"
17-Apr-23,"Scroll to the bottom for the summarized version. Knocked off 3 stars based on more than just the 3% charge built into the bill for employees regardless of your party size. When tip was  added, the wait staff hide behind the counter and talk amongst each other as opposed to providing service nor restaurant hospitality. (I.e checking on drinks, providing the correct condiments etc. ) The staff are not rude, they are clearly unmotivated to provide an excellent dining experience from the moment you order and complete payment with 3% tip automatically included on top of tipping at the beginning of your experience.  Once the plates are set down, the wait staff do not return to check if the meals are ok or if anything additional is needed. The food was good and plentiful.Summarized version - Don't make me pay $80 + for SH!T service for 3 guests when the restaurant wasn't filled to 1/2 of it's capacity!!!"
16-Apr-23,"Ambiance is Zen with a hip hop vibe. The food is good and healthy. Excellent customer service, I'll definitely be back!"
15-Apr-23,"We found this place while going to the local farmers market a block away. Plenty of parking in the structure across the street. You order at the entrance and they bring the food to you. At 9am there was no one but by 930 there was a line out the door. Service was attentive, food came to the table fast and was delicious. We ordered the Nashville hot chicken Benedict (order it spicy) and kimchi spam omelette. Both were fantastic. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and not dry on the inside. Kimchi was mild, not acidic. Coffee was decent, like what a good cafe would serve."
15-Apr-23,"Do you want a full and happy tummy? GO HERE!The eggs benedict was delicious, and the yolk was perfect--duh! What really won me over was the ube french toast.... I'll go back every time for that. Crispy on the outside and no skimp on the ube at all!!! Delicious in every way. I wish I had more whip cream or smth cool to pair it with, because it definitely is heavy and sweet, but wow, SO GOOD! I'm making my friends try this place every time. The service was kind, and the whole place was aesthetic and cute. You walk in, and then you order and pick a table yourself. Me and my partner went around 1:30pm on a Friday, and were able to find a table easily. My partner got hand squeezed orange juice, and it was delicious. Definitely a fun place. PLEASE GO HERE, it was sooo good."
14-Apr-23,"Finally I tried this place. My mouth was watering as i seen the pictures of Fried French-toast. Once the plate was in front of me I was happy. Big portion, kinda pricy. Not too sweet just right. You pay first before seating."
13-Apr-23,"Th ambience was nice, we got there at 9:30 and it was packed. Thankfully we were seated (at the bar) after we ordered. We got the ube French toast which was a little too sweet for me and the classic eggs Benedict- which I liked so much. I would definitely come back here for brunch and would recommend it to everyone."
13-Apr-23,"Amazing service, the food was great as well  especially the house french toast. The vibe was really great too."
10-Apr-23,"It was my first time trying eggs Benedict, and they were delicious. Also tried the house French toast, and it was incredible. They weren't too sweet and slightly crunchy, which was a first for me.You pay before even sitting down they just give you a number, and you choose whatever seating is available. They don't take reservations, and the place isn't that big, so it gets full on Saturdays, and I'm guessing on Sundays even more. Prices may seem high, but to me, the amount of food and the taste was worth it. The food also comes out pretty quick."
9-Apr-23,"Honestly, there aren't very many brunch places in the immediate area. Popping Yolk has always had really good service and the food comes out pretty quickly. This location has really easy parking and is very convenient.It seems no matter what time you come, there's always a line out the door. The eggs benedict is very solid. I also love to go for either a latte or a fresh squeezed orange juice. It's just a good venue or place to hang out with friends or have a place to catch up with at locally."
7-Apr-23,"If you love eggs you'll love this place by default. If you don't like eggs you can get it without eggs. Yummy food, would come again."
7-Apr-23,"Heard about this place for awhile now finally get a chance to try.  If you're looking for egg Benedict kinda breakfast this is the place! But if you're looking for something special and unique then maybe not.  However the good was good.  I got the Norwegian egg Benedict.  The egg was perfect and so is the potatoes.  Just wish they would put more salmons in it.  Oh their hazelnut latte is also good. Overall, food is good, would come back if I'm in The area and in the mood for egg Benedict."
6-Apr-23,"This place is legit! If you're craving some bomb brunch, hit this place up.  The menu has got all your classics covered like omelets and eggs benedicts, but they also throw in some creative twists that'll make your taste buds do a little dance. I didn't know French toasts could be deep fried, but the full order was on point - I left feeling satisfied but not too stuffed with the other food. I wish I took a picture, but my friends and I were so hungry that we completely forgot. The place had that hipster brunch spot feel without being too pretentious."
6-Apr-23,"We came while visiting colleges and found this place on Yelp.  The French toast is out of this world and a must order...even as a shared dish.  The crunchy bread is unbelievable.  We also had an avocado croissant which was absolutely delicious and the potatoes are to die for.  Honestly....if I lived here I'd come here regularly. Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and amazing food.  Highly recommend."
4-Apr-23,"this spot was pretty crowded around noon, so make sure to join their waitlist in advance! food here is delicious--I ordered their Nashville hot chicken Benedict, bbq pulled pork omelette, and ube French toast! needless to say, their omelette was stuffed with mushrooms, spinach, & pork and the bbq sauce tied it all together. The Nashville hot chicken Benedict was also really tasty. If you have a sweet tooth, definitely try their Ube French Toast which has a sweet ube filling inside & is topped with coconut flakes & blueberries."
2-Apr-23,"The food is delicious, if you are planning to eat inside. We came on a Saturday and decided to eat outside for a fresher ambiance because it's crowded/loud inside. However, the trash bin is outside on the other side of the dining tables and the alley smells like urine. Around 10:30-11am the city comes to pick up the trash. We were trying to eat our food while we were trying our best to ignore the smell of sewage and trash. Not a pleasant experience when you pay $70 for two brunches and the ambiance is next to a trash can! If you sit outside avoid Saturday morning trash day or just sit inside. I'm not coming back to this location because I enjoy eating outside due to the crowds. Pasadena has much more decent seating outside if your willing to make the drive."
31-Mar-23,"Found this place for brunch and mimosas on a Friday. It was pretty empty when we got there and we ordered at the counter before sitting down. There were lots of tables and the atmosphere overall seemed chill. I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict and it was ready within minutes of sitting down. The Benedicts were delicious and not too spicy and the dish came out with some nice salad and potatoes. It was a lot of food a bit heavy but I barely managed to finish it! We also got the Mimosa Kit, which came with a bottle of champagne and OJ. It was priced reasonably and enough for 3 people to share."
30-Mar-23,"Came for breakfast on a Monday morning and had a good experience. You order at the cashier and pay before you're given a number to take to your table. My earl grey latte was good and so were our benedicts. I liked the house yuzu dressing with the greens, it was a refreshing side. I only wish the side potatoes are home fries rather than basically cubed french fries.Would definitely come again to try the other dishes!"
27-Mar-23,"Do yourself a favor and avoid the crepes and waffles-- dry, flavorless, and disguised under canned whip cream and syrup. For the prices they charge, the quality just isn't there. Savory sandwiches are just alright but the fried potatoes are the true MVPs. It's like a Denny's without the sweet old ladies who call you ""Dear."""
27-Mar-23,"There aren't a lot of American Brunch places in Alhambra but Popping Yolk holds the bar pretty high even without a ton of competition nearby. I've been a fan for a while and recently they added ube french toast to the menu. It's so good!! It's definitely a bit too sweet as your own breakfast entree (or not, depending on your sweet tooth!) but it's great to share on top of any of their other more savory dishes. There's an ube custard inside the deep fried toast, with an ube dip and maple syrup. All their omelet and benedict dishes are a pretty big portion size as well. You order at the counter and then get seated after. I can also vouch that their food still comes great if you get it via delivery!"
25-Mar-23,"Very disappointed here. The food looks amazing online and the presentation is fine but everything is basically deep fried which is extremely misleading because I did not see this detail anywhere online. I mean why deep fry ""home potatoes""?! Because they potatoes were cut so small,  there were bites that were more oil than potatoes. The bacon was tasty but definitely undercooked. Not recommending or going back, be upfront with your food."
24-Mar-23,The food was amazing and this place is now one of my breakfast stops when I'm in the LA area!
22-Mar-23,"Great food! Service is good too! I just wish you didn't have to order as soon as you walk in, but other than that I definitely recommend this place!!"
21-Mar-23,"There's always a long line outside, and a pretty hefty wait. It was a rainy Saturday (which you would think deters people from going out, but alas it did not). Still waited 40min for 2 people, which is totally fine. I knew what I was getting into. So not knocking points on that. You order as soon as you get called, and then you sit. Got the waffles (which were very dry), do not recommend. And the avocado benedict. Which was definitely better than the waffles. Came with tiny baby potatoes and a side salad. Latte was fine as well. I'd wanna try the French toast next time, and see if they are even slightly better than the waffles. Free parking in the structure off 1st street."
21-Mar-23,"We ordered the House French Toast, Ube French Toast and orange juice. The Ube French toast came with fresh blueberries, and whip cream. The House French Toast came with strawberries, blueberries and whip cream. The food we ordered was delicious and filling. The orange juice  we ordered tasted freshly made. When you enter the cafe you order your food up front then take a seat where they will later bring out your food. The cafe was clean, with decorative plants with cozy lighting."
20-Mar-23,"Nice restaurant for breakfast/brunch. I ordered Norwegian Benedict and Hazelnut Latte. The Benedict was tasty, comes with spinach and fried potatoes. Love the inside decorations. The cashier is friendly. You order at the counter and take the number to your table if you dine in. They open every day till 3pm."
19-Mar-23,"First time eating at Popping Yoke Cafe. A bit strange to order at the counter then get a table. However, the food was amazing. Try the Norwegian Benedict, it won't disappoint."
19-Mar-23,"I came here on a Saturday and was blown away with the food and friendly service. Parking on Main Street can be tight but I found street parking a few blocks away. I was also told there is a parking lot near by.We ordered the following:1. Cowboy burger: perfectly cooked and delicious. Came with a huge helping of potatoes (super yummy) and garden salad.2. Kimchi spam omelette, also came with potatoes and salad, this was an amazing dish. My mom loved it!3. Nashville chicken sandwich, we ordered it mild and it was crunchy and perfectly cooked: next time I'll get it  spicy.3. Berry farm crepe: this was almost like a dessert but wasn't overly sweet: I loved having this at the end of my meal.4. Drip coffee was strong and comes with free refills.Overall, this is a perfect breakfast/brunch. Highly recommend it if you are in the area!"
18-Mar-23,I always drive past this place and see the long lines but finally got the chance to try it when it wasn't so busy. The food is great and the options are plentiful. The service is great and the employees are amazing. The place is clean and trendy. The Bad: The price is very high. I spent $50 on breakfast for two people. But nice place to stop for brunch and fancier option than the chain restaurants.
18-Mar-23,"Cute little place. Cappuccino wasn't quite the best but acceptable. Food was great. Nice selection of breakfast plates. I had the pulled pork omelette. Yum. Parking a little difficult. Found a parking structure around the corner. Food came out super quick as did drinks, even the cappuccino."
18-Mar-23,Very good food. I was impressed with the menu and prices. The wait time was also reasonable.
16-Mar-23,"I came back another time to eat here again. I recommend the weekdays are the better times to come - no wait, no lines like the ones I see on the weekends, and the food comes out super fast so it's a win-win! I decided to go simple this time and get the ham and cheese omelet. Still the same classic  breakfast meal that you can't go wrong with, so you know they are consistent!"
16-Mar-23,"A delightful experience! The menu had a number of options, but I ultimately decided on the avocado benedict and a mimosa. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed!  The mimosa was the perfect compliment to my meal, it was perfectly balanced and not too sour. But what made my experience better was the service. They bring out water to you even if you don't ask for it! The staff was attentive and friendly, making sure my water was never empty and checking in on me periodically to see if I needed anything else. All in all, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fast and enjoyable meal :D"
13-Mar-23,"Customer service wasn't there at all. Order in front and they bring your stuff then that's it. Order from DoorDash they never confirm the order and they had to complete it when you have to wait for another half hour. So total wait from time ordering was 1:30. Food is typical as other brunch places nothing really outstanding. But if you wanted brunch, it will be a good spot to go to. Good portion for the price. Food flavor is good but nothing special. It's a healthier version of ihop n Denny's."
12-Mar-23,First time here and definitely will not return. My wife received her meal at least 15 minutes before our kids and I. The fried breakfast potatoes had the same flavor as the French fries that the lunch truck serves at a construction site. It seems like the oil needs to be changed. Over all a bad experience. Would have gotten a better breakfast at half the price at Denny's down the street.
11-Mar-23,"Get here as early as you can because it fills fast and the wait can be long. My friends and I got here around 11 and the wait was about 30 minutes. It was starting to rain, so it made the wait feel longer than it already was. You order at the front counter and seat youself, so the line moves pretty quickly. The guy taking our order was patient with us which was nice since we couldn't figure out what to get.For drinks, I got an orange juice which is freshly squeezed. It is expensive for $7 a glass, but it was refreshing and I saw them putting the oranges in the machine so it's guaranteed to be quality juice. For the food, I went for a croissant avocado ham sandwich. It's a classic brunch sandwich with sunny side up eggs on top. You can't go wrong with that. It was pretty messy eating it because the yolk ends up all over the place, though. The side salad and potatoes that come with every plate is a nice touch, but I had to take most of it to-go. That being said, it's a good portion size. We were pleased with the customer service. The ladies were very quick and attentive and brought us everything we needed, especially a lot of napkins for my runny yolks! My only complaints for this place would be that it's a little pricey. Overall, the food is not bad for what it is. I would come here again for brunch!"
11-Mar-23,"This is my usual go to as the food is good, but after my experience today I don't see myself coming back. Customer service and management team sucks. We got here at around 2:20 and didn't get our food until 2:40-2:45 ish. By 2:55 (5 mins before they were closing) we were still eating. They turned up the speakers and put police siren sounds on super loudly to kick everyone out. All of the customers were so confused and it was scaring us. The staff obviously could see that the customers were confused and panicking but didn't care.... It would be nice if they could've told us last calls were a certain time or that they close at exactly 2:55 or 3 PM instead of trying to force us out with police sirens on loud speakers. Terrible customer service and management, extremely unprofessional. Please fix this."
11-Mar-23,Great food and service. Just a bit of a wait but line moved quickly. Potatoes were perfection!
5-Mar-23,"excellenot egg benediCT's. tried a long story about the great service and great people but got hung up in trying to post. suffice it to say, we'll go again and bring the grandkids again.  the people there were really wonderful to our grandkids"
4-Mar-23,"ordered upon entrance, seated quickly even though it was the weekend, and thoroughly enjoyed a little of everything. yum! fast, efficient and also delicious - came for breakfast two days back to back (yes, it was that memorable). ordered the french toast, salmon Benedict and Nashville Fried chicken Benedict and was equally blown away by all of the above. my favorite was the nashville bene (pictured) -- great joint, hearty portions, bring your appetite!"
28-Feb-23,Good food. Recommend for some breakfast. The potatoes are crispy and food are great too. Right amount of food. You should try the taro/ube bread.
25-Feb-23,Delish eggs Benny with the fried chick and coleslaw in it- Innit sound unusual? But it was goooood to go! I'll be back to try other brekkies options fo sho!
24-Feb-23,"Chicken sandwich was not good. After biting through tons and tons of breading, a half dollar size piece of chicken appeared. The French toast was bomb, but the sandwich which was my main course was small and not very tasty."
20-Feb-23,"Such a great brunch spot! Amazing vibes inside the restaurant (they were playing very very good music) and the food was absolutely delicious. The service was great and we were checked in promptly. The restaurant was a little busy given it was a Sunday morning, but the food was brought out to us relatively quickly. I got the California Omelette, House French Toast, and the Ube French Toast. I really liked the taste of the french toast and the ube flavor was spot on and yummy. The drinks were also very delicious --highly recommend the horchata latte! I can't say to come back and make this a go-to brunch stop :)"
19-Feb-23,"Really good! Went on a weekday (weekends are out the door, don't even bother!) and it was kinda packed. You order at the front and you can sit anywhere. If you're going with a group, I suggest ordering first and finding a seat. I got the original Benedict and it was a huge portion! Finished the entire thing and I didn't feel disgusting afterwards lol. I would definitely go again!"
17-Feb-23,"Very accommodating and great vibes. Staff started us with water and utensils right away. Great place for lunch and for small parties. They don't really do reservation for seats, mostly a first come first serve basis. The manager was nothing but amazing and made it happen for us regardless. Our huge group of 15+ was able to sit by each other. They also had to put up a sign saying ""they would not be taking anymore dine in order"" because of our party. Glad there wasn't too much people during peak hours and they were able remove the sign once our order was taken care of. Food in general was very delicious. Smoked Salmon Egg Benedict was my favorite pick and definitely great for first timers. Egg was perfect 10/10. Salad wasn't that great because of the lack of dressing sauce. Country Fried Potato was surprisingly good. Mozzarella Sticks are great appetizers. The cheese pull did its job. 10/10. Desserts are a must try. Had the scoop of vanilla Ice Cream which was basic. House French Toast (Full or Half order) was worth trying! Half order should be enough for a party of 3. Favorite dessert was the Strawberry crepe!"
17-Feb-23,"Rip off! $83 for 2 adults and a toddler. Restaurant cuts corners every chance they get. The ketchup isn't real, tastes bitter, knock off brand. The bacon tastes like plastic and food filled with msg. Staff does not say hi, no eye contact, and nit pleasant. Skip this place!"
16-Feb-23,"The food was good but it was really pricey! $85 for a plate of waffles, their Hawaiian burger and their Nashville eggs Benedict plate! :o the customer service was good, their vanilla latte was ok. The food was good, it didn't come out really hot so it got cold really quick and daughters waffles were pretty dry and rock hard though. Would we go back? Yes. It's a nice little brunch place."
15-Feb-23,"Huge portion but little flavor, eggs overdone, a bit too rich and oily to be healthy. Not for us."
14-Feb-23,"Food was amazing!! It gets pretty crowded and packed, so be sure to plan ahead! Parking is streets"
14-Feb-23,"Today we took a stroll and decided to walk to the popping yolk, the vibe is very chill and laid back. We go in ordered and self seating with a number. We waited about 10-15 min for food. The food looked delicious, and tasted delicious. I wish it came with more toast because it was so good. The staff is very nice and sweet, but not very attentive. If you need something make sure you let them know. Overall a cute breakfast spot."
13-Feb-23,Nice surprise breakfast.  We went on weekday and it was busy.  Service was good and so was the food.
7-Feb-23,Went around 11:30 ordered right away and got seated. Food came in pretty fast. Food is pretty okay. Nice ambience. Cute place. Would come back again.
5-Feb-23,I have gear experience at popping yolk cafe. This my first time at the cafe I have bacon and egg sandwich
4-Feb-23,Very good. Great portions and fresh ingredients. My only gripe is it is a bit small on the inside.
3-Feb-23,"Once you get seated you're given water ,food usually arrives fairly quick.  The servers usually don't check up on you and that's okay. Forgot to mention you do pay before sitting . The environment is welcoming , Rustic style ,they do have a few booths available. 10/10 Classic Benedict  - great flavor ! Hollandaise sauce is creamy and rich . The Ham and Bacon are great ! Bacon adds a little texture . 8/10  Diced Potatoes these are crunchy and good 8/10 Side Salad - fresh and sour .  Banana toffee Waffles 8/10 - waffles are almost crumbly and crunchy A little dry . They garnish it with Vanilla ice cream and fresh bananas . Overall really good.10/10 Bellini  9/10 orange juice made freshCheck comes out to $60 ish Worth it? Hell Yeah! Thank you."
2-Feb-23,Very good food and coffee excellent!! There is always a line but it moves fast worth the wait!! Been back a few times new favorite brunch spot!
1-Feb-23,"I had a fantastic brunch experience at thisrestaurant! The food was absolutely delicious, with a variety of options that satisfied everyone in my party. Not only did everything taste great, but it also looked amazing on the plate. The space was clean and well-kept, adding to the overall pleasant atmosphere. And to top it off, I was a big fan of the espresso machine - the coffee was perfectly brewed and hit the spot. Great restaurant, highly recommend trying it out."
30-Jan-23,"I absolutely love the food here. The place is super cute too. I went when they first opened. They had a few kinks in the beginning with the flow of ordering and getting you seated.  I went a good handful of times before the Pandemic. I finally went again recently and was pleasantly surprised that they added many items to their menu! Again, all the items were delicious. My favorite savory item is the kimchi spam omelette. And for the sweet is their French toast.  I'm very happy they made it through this difficult time during the Pandemic when many businesses closed. I will continue to be a loyal customer."
29-Jan-23,"Met some of my girlfriends here for a weekend brunch. We had a pretty long wait for a table. We also had a long wait to order at the counter.Found a nice space on the back patio that was partially enclosed.Because they were so busy, service was slow. We didn't mind because we were chatting and enjoying our coffees. They don't serve decaf btw. I was super excited when i saw the Ube French Toast on the menu! I'm a big fan of the ube!!When my dish arrived it was beautiful! Magazine worthy! Unfortunately the taste was not good. The texture was weird and I was so disappointed. Oh, and this is one of those places that charges a service charge for being their customer-it takes a lot of nerve to charge someone extra for patronizing their establishment. It's not like the prices are dirt cheap so they have to make the money somehow. Lucky for me, I don't ever have to go back."
27-Jan-23,I love their food - I tried their Salmon Eggs Benedict and the Salmon Omelette.  Both come with crispy fried potatoes and a small serving of green salad. I have tried this restaurant in Pasadena and Alhambra and food has consistently been good.   Service in Alhambra is EXCELLENT.  Pasadena is a bit slow
23-Jan-23,"Been here at least 3 times now and I have yet to be disappointed. Although, one time I did take my order to go and it was kind of soggy. That was my own fault though, I haven't done it since. Everything always taste better in restaurant! I usually always get the eggs Benny + some kind of French toast to share. We got the ube one this time and wow! Really good! Even reheated it was good. I'm more of a savory person so I could never just have that as brunch but hey, if you're into that you won't regret!"
22-Jan-23,"I have enjoyed this place. Service is good and food is traditional yet tasty. Not a lot of super healthy options, but that is not the goal here. 5 starts"
21-Jan-23,"Came around 10-11am with a party of 5. There was a pretty long wait. Waited for 30-40 minutes.Norwegian Benefit: Good portions. A perfect runny yoke for the benedict, smoked salmon, with a side of salad and country fried potatoes. Overall delicious. If you're okay with waiting, this is a nice brunch spot."
19-Jan-23,I came here after the farmers market (down the street from resturant). They have a kiosk in the front of the resturant for you to sign in. Study the menu as you wait for your table bc you are expected to place your order before you are seated. We were seated outdoors. Decor was minimal. There was a slight sour smell we were unable to identify. After we left through the backdoor we noticed the dumpster is right next to the dining area. Perhaps management can move that to improve the outdoor experience as we were not the only ones to notice the smell. Food is decent. Majority of the plates are around $20.  Portions are large.
19-Jan-23,"Food was good but staff did get two items on our order wrong. We did not make a big fuss about it, but did have them correct one item as we asked for a hot tea and received a iced tea. My mom did receive the wrong crepe but did not want us to wait longer for her to get the crepe she ordered. Besides that food was delicious."
16-Jan-23,"Such a delicious and cute place! The decor and atmosphere is so warm and welcoming and inviting, and the eggs benedict menu is diverse and delicious. Such a fitting name for a place that serves an iconic dish, and perfectly poached eggs. Each benedict plate comes with a fresh green salad and delicious hot breakfast potatoes."
15-Jan-23,I've been here 3 times and it never disappoints! The food is always so flavorful! The egg Benedict and potatoes are the best! The vanilla in the vanilla latte is delicious and similar to Tierra Mia Coffee. The French toast is by far the best I've ever tried in my life.
15-Jan-23,"Food was great, it was the service that was unbearable.  Had to waive down staff  for water multiple times, requested if there was any way to close the front door because the cold breeze was entering and hitting my back (it was raining outside). They said no.  It was such a weird experience. Will not return to this location."
13-Jan-23,"Really great food. My husband and I both had the Benedict's and they were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. We did wait a bit at peak hour but nothing crazy. Service was great, you order at the counter, pay and then sit. Really easy and speeds up the process. We didn't wait too long and got our food fairly quick. We were both on parental leave during our visit and our 3 month baby was with us in his car seat stroller. They were able to accommodate us and sat us by the front tables so we could have space to park our stroller. Such a lovely experience and we continue to visit. 10/10"
12-Jan-23,"We came here on a rainy Saturday morning (New Years Eve). It was a recommendation and not disappointed!It was busy when we showed up (10am), we signed in & put our name and group size down on their tablet. We were a group of 6. The inside of the restaurant was full & busy. We were 5th in line. The woman in the register did let me know they had a back patio area that we could sit immediately if we didn't mind. That was about 10-15 min into our wait. *It's divided into two types of ""ceiling-cover"". One cement and another tarpy looking thing that keeps the sun and raindrops away. *It was outside and the air was fresh and quiet as we were the only ones back there. The music doesn't go back there but it's great if your trying to have a conversation so you don't have to yell. My bf & I had the: *Norwegian Benedict *Berries Farm Liege Waffle Amazing! Big portion and it was warm and fresh. Our food was brought to our table after placing it in the front of the restaurant. Small clean restaurant. Didn't use the RR so can't review. Parking is free in the structures around the corner. We can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu!"
8-Jan-23,"Note that this is a review for a visit on 12/19/2022. I'll say that right off the bat that the food was excellent. I had the French Toast and my wife had Norwegian Eggs Benedict. Both were great.However, what wasn't great:Service charge. For what? Just another way to tack on more fees for our order? Why can't this be included in the price on the menu instead of sneaking it in at the end when we pay? Businesses should be paid for their product, but this is misleading and not appreciated.When our water was brought to our table, there were lip marks on the rims of both glasses. This was fixed promptly, but left a bad impression on us during our visit.There were also two smoke detectors on their patio that kept playing their high-pitched chirping telling us that their batteries were low. These should be serviced. Lastly, the timing of our food at our table was poor. So much time had passed between mine and my wife's food that she was nearly done before mine had arrived. While the food was very good, I disliked the overall experience. I probably won't return."
7-Jan-23,Place is ok. French toast was good. Nothing special. Not worth the price. Expensive for a breakfast spot
5-Jan-23,"This spot surprisingly is pretty busy so you might have to wait a while. The portions were pretty good. My friend and I shared the hot chicken sandwich and the Norwegian Benedict. It is a order and then get seated deal, so if you're waiting beforehand, I'd look through the menu and decide so you don't feel pressured when it comes to ordering. The food is really the only positive, but for some thats all that matters!"
3-Jan-23,"All reviews are just reminders to myself.Went last weekNorwegian benedict:- eggs perfectly done- salmon and seasoning prepared well- salad meh- potatoes good if eaten quickly. Not that good when cooled down. Would prefer steak fries prepared in similar manner- wish there was less potato and more egg thoughBlueberry French toast:- nice and crunchy outside- gooey center - nothing too sweet- blueberries complement the toast Order at the front, seated pretty quickly"
1-Jan-23,"Came here for brunch. It was a short wait even though we had to check in on the iPad. They were very full when we arrived but a few tables were at the tail end of their meal. We ordered at the counter. We went with the French Toast for the kiddo, Kimchi Spam Omelette for me, and Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict for my husband. Nothing disappointed and on top of it the portions were huge. Only feedback was the need for more dressing on the salad but who goes there for the salad? ‍ Will gladly go back."
31-Dec-22,"Food was undercooked. Eggs were not cooked all the way, calamari was flimsy. Diced potatoes were over cooked and very hard to eat. Ordered side of sausage and calamari 5 minutes after original food...as it came out 30 minutes after regular food. As well as the side sausage was burnt. Staff was polite and very welcoming...just wish food wasn't either undercooked, long wait or overcooked."
30-Dec-22,"I finally got to try Popping Yolk a couple weeks ago and had a pleasant experience overall. I ordered the Avocado Benedict, which was tasty and generously portioned. The side salad that came with the dish was surprisingly delicious and I probably would have been happy eating a ton of that on its own! My group of 6 people arrived around 1pm on a Saturday and only waited 10 or so minutes for a table to free up, so don't be too discouraged if the line seems a little long!"
29-Dec-22,"I've been wanting to try this place for quite some time now. The food was good but there are some things that can be improved. I ordered the avocado Benedict, Norwegian Benedict with extra avacado, pulled pork Benedict with extra avocado and French toast. I also asked for all the potatoes to be extra crispy. The food came out and there was no extra avocado with either the Norwegian or pulled pork Benedict. The potatoes were not too crispy and needed a little extra seasoning. The salad barely had any dressing on it and they didn't even bring us syrup for the French toast. All three Benedict's were delicious granted if they had completed the plate it would have made it just that much better. You shouldn't have to ask for syrup for French toast, that's kind of a given right? If all these little things were done, the plates would have been better put together."
26-Dec-22,"Hipster trendy brunch spot. Probably great for instagram but not going to be a staple for those of us who want to relax. Bring your girlfriend here to impress her I guess.ZOMG PRICES:Super steep pricing for mainly eggs and potatoes. They also add a 3% service charge for the kitchen staff because they don't want to pay them more. I expect that in San Diego. I'm surprised to see that in Alhambra.None of the sandwiches even came with bacon (except the bacon sandwich). It was a $5 add on.FOOD:Plating and food looks gorgeous. Taste is good but overall it's simple food made fancier and unhealthier.Every entree comes with a simple salad (appreciated) and a large pile of crispy potatoes. They're more like small French fries than breakfast potatoes which should be roasted. Seasoning is very very light as well.Avocado and Ham Croissant with added bacon - Overall delicious. Running eggs live up to their name.California Omelette - Well stuffed with veg but the egg was cooked pretty dry. Not bad but not very special.House French Toast - Deep fried and drenched in syrup/condensed milk. I was worried it would be soggy but it maintained its crispness well. Came with a good amount of fresh fruit too. It was good but I think I still prefer regular French toast. Less guilt. The Regular Iced Tea - Terrible Pepsi fountain stuffSERVICE:Unexpectedly, it's a pay before you sit with a number card style place (think Panera). Staff was friendly and did handle refills and whatnot well however. They're also always cleaning the tables as fast as possible so that was nice too.More like a 3.5 star."
24-Dec-22,"Definitely do NOT come here. It's like the restaurant doesn't care about ticket time or order at all. Or their ordering system overall just SUCKS.  I came here with my friend, and after he received his food, I had to wait an additional 40 minutes for my food to come out! The worst part of it all was seeing everyone else who ordered after us receive their meals. I had to ask to cancel my food order and issue a refund for the inconvenience.  Overall shitty experience  for mediocre overpriced food, AND there was no apology. Long story short, go anywhere else. P.s. Do not tip 20% either.. the service is non-existent.Also- Candy, please stop responding with the same customer response and ACTUALLY  do something about it."
20-Dec-22,LOVE THIS PLACE. I drive all the way from chino hills just to eat brunch here. Every single thing I've tried was good
19-Dec-22,"Located on Main. Parking at the front of the cafe is limited, but there is parking across the street by the library. I always wanted to try this place since the photos (food and place) look so colorful. It was already quite busy when I dropped by, filled with joyful people.I got the Teriyaki Chicken Omelette and Mozzarella Sticks. The food is on the pricier side but the portions are large. The food was good."
17-Dec-22,"Pros:1. #1 thing I have to talk about is the ""country fried potatoes"" (it came with the croissant sandwich). It sounded like the same random forgettable potatoes at most restaurants but let me tell you these are the best fries I've ever had in my life. Perfectly light and toasty, not dry, very flavorful, but the fries are tiny little cubes so that they have MORE surface area for more of the good crunchy parts. SOOOOOOO good - I want to eat three plates of just this.2. The croissant avocado and ham sandwich was good too.3. Presentation of every plate is worthy of IG.Cons:1. Had to wait awhile because they are popular, but it was ok."
16-Dec-22,First time here also First time having eggs Benedict must say the plate I ordered  was delicious potatoes cooked just right nice and toasty the sauce  they  put on the eggs tasty ...a plate you must try.We also ordered two more delicious plates witch I sampled taste as good as they look !
9-Dec-22,Their pulled pork benedict was amazing. I don't eat brunch much but the combination of egg and delicious and tender pork was extremely satisfying.
