30-Mar-23,"Was super excited to try this place. There was a family ahead of us who ordered a multitude of items, but because of it, we somehow waited 40 minutes for soft serve with 2 toppings each. I would like to think the employees were new and want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but for over $20 for 2 scoops of ice cream for each of us, we just had hoped for a different experience. My ice cream wasn't even fully mixed and the picture is of my boyfriend's...rough."
23-Mar-23,"Great customer service and calm, clean environment. I got the CapN'Berry and it was delicious."
16-Mar-23,"Found this place while driving by and decided to check it out.  It's super cute inside.  They serve ice cream, protein shakes, acai bowls... etc.  The girl helping us was super nice and welcoming as we walked in.  My daughter ordered the TNT acai bowl and loved it.  Was already planning her next trip while driving home. I'll definitely be recommending to other people and will definitely be coming back. So glad we don't have to drive so far for a good acai bowl."
5-Mar-23,Place is right outside my apartment complex. Covers my late night sweets cravings. Places is dope!
23-Feb-23,"We live in the apartments nearby and decided to try them out. Their ice cream, acai bowls, and smoothies are all fresh and made to order. We got the toastNtoffee ice cream, the PinkNBow ice cream, TNT acai bowl, Paradise acai bowl, and the paradise point smoothie. Although they were out of passion fruit juice for the paradise point smoothie, they were able to substitute it with peach juice instead and it was still super good! The ice creams are like a soft serve mixed with your choice/chosen cereals and swirled into your cup. We got all our item to go, so they were able to put all our ice creams in the cup that they usually put their smoothies in. The cups are re-usable, sturdy plastic cups. Good quality foods and quality products they use. Super clean and cute esthetic in there, and it was well maintained. The service was excellent, however I regret not getting the kind gentleman and lady's name that served us! They did an amazing job. We signed up for their loyalty program and was able to receive 10% discount on our first visit. I would highly recommend this to anybody looking to get a sweet fix."
22-Feb-23,We ordered the Dreamn Orange and the Cap'n Berry Treats and they were delicious.  The young man that helped us was very nice and helpful though we didn'tget his name.   Prices are affordable and the menu is simple. Was worth coming by even though it snowed earlier today!! Music choice was good too. Swing chairs were a cool feature.
18-Feb-23,Place is nice inside and in a nice quiet location. Crazy cool combinations of healthy juices and treats. Highly recommend checking this place out.
9-Feb-23,"One word, DELICIOUS! Upon walking in, I was greeted warmly, with a great smile. The hip-hop music had a great beat too. This place is extremely clean with a simple yet elegant decor.I ordered the Snap N' Jack, without the sour patch kids and was asked if I'd like to substitute anything instead, which was very thoughtful.The ice cream and mixins were balanced and not too sweet. I will be back to try their other offerings.Come check this place out if your looking for a cleans, boost, protein shake, or try their ice cream, if you have a sweet tooth!"
5-Feb-23,This place is new and nearby so convinced my husband to try it out. We both decided on A√ßa√≠ bowls. The TNT and Paradise. I do have to say it is pricey compared to other places. It was good we enjoyed. Will stop in to try something else from their menu.
1-Feb-23,"Wow this place is so YUMMY! We ordered the Acia bowl and it was the best one I've ever had! It was so creamy, refreshing, and sweet. I could eat one for breakfast every. single. day."
29-Jan-23,"Location is a bit confusing as it's across the parking lot from an apartment complex. I went 2 days in a row! I didn't get the concept until I got there and saw the menu. Thick & thin serves both decadent treats like ice cream and shakes for ""thick"" and freshly pressed juices and a√ßa√≠ bowls for the ""thin"". I love the concept! Prices are on the higher end but I personally think its worth it cause its so freaking good.The first day I stopped by I tried one of their juices. It came in their own labeled plastic bottle similar to Pressed. The next day I went back to try a Thick treat and ordered the Toast N Toffee. Their ice creams are if cold-stone were made into soft serves. I'm obsessed with the texture of the ice cream and crunchy bits from the mix-ins. They have pre-made flavor combinations but you can custom choose your own mix-ins too. I also appreciate the design and aesthetics. The store itself is really cute. I'm happy to have a new place like this in the neighborhood :)"
26-Jan-23,"Stopped here to try a new ice cream store, but it was $24 for 2 cups of a soft serve type ice cream, and one of the cups was just plain ice cream with no toppings, while the other cup only had sprinkles. The ice cream was smooth and creamy but just too expensive for a young family."
15-Jan-23,"This place is amazing.  They have protein shakes, fresh pressed juices, smoothies, milk shakes, and soft serve.  We had the strawberry shake and it was delicious.  Lots of strawberry flavor and not too sweet.  Definitely check this place out."
14-Jan-23,"Cute store! Delicious treats! We were greeted when we walked in and employees where happy to explain parts of the menu and answer questions. My son did the build your own ice cream and devoured it! The Gummy Bear and the Jungle Jam were also yummy. Jungle Jam a a slightly tart healthy smoothie. Gummy Bear was a tart and sweet, so perfect for my daughter. We all left very pleased!"
29-Dec-22,"My family and I love this place! The treats are one of a kind and so delicious and the owner and workers are beyond kind and hardworking. It is such a cute shop, and they have great treats for anyone, ice cream, shakes, a√ßa√≠ bowls, smoothies, etc.! I get excited to go when I am in town now, and my family always has great things to say about the owner and the treats! If I could give it more than 5 stars I would!"
26-Dec-22,Been here twice and the quality and flavor is about the best you will experience.I highly recommend giving them a taste.
24-Dec-22,Best protein shake I think I've ever had ... and I've had my fair share  ! Nothing beats delicious AND healthy . I love this place!
3-Dec-22,"One of the Newest Best Spots in Las Vegas!! If your looking for juices, healthy shots it's a perfect place bc everything is made fresh. If your looking for desserts, protein shakes they are one of a kind and taste amazinggg. The customer service is top tier & The ambiance is wonderful. Highly recommend"
26-Nov-22,"Mood- Wellness ShotsI entertain a very healthy regime to be able to have my indulgences in my off time. With that being said my day to day diet is pretty strict honestly. I am on this Mudwater trend plus an excessive amount of water daily. In addition I have incorporated Wellness Shots into my weekly routine. When I saw pictures of this place I had to check out the menu. It had my intrigue.Upon entering was quickly greeted and asked if there were any questions re: the menu. I had none, as I checked out the menu prior and knew what I wanted to entertain. You order at the front counter, pay, and wait for your order to be called.Opted for the Mood Riser, IV Recovery, and of course that Vitality Booster. Now I will admit what I truly loved about this experience. You get to watch them create your drinks, and the shots right there. It is not prepackaged. These items are made in house with a shelf life of 3 days. So I quickly slammed the Mood Riser and even though the flavor was intense - this let me know all of the ingredients were fresh. Interior is bright and airy. There is a small bench for waiting and a couple of floating chairs. There is outdoor seating as well. Everything was very clean. Music was playing in the background. There is merch for sale as well. I should have bought a hoodie as the colors are def fitting for the fall season. Staff is very courteous and hospitable. Would most def recommend - the pricing in my opinion for the quality of the items ordered along with it being made right in front of you, was beyond reasonable. Also The packaging had my attention. This location is part of a whole new concept of 3 places that will be intertwined for physical, mental, and overall social well being. I love that this keeps with the core values the owner has. While allowing us to indulge in some sweet tasting goodies mixed with some really overall healthy staples that are needed to properly fuel and repair the body.Location is Dean Martin/ Cactus - ample parking"
26-Nov-22,Came in today for coffee. Typically come in for the detox a nice green healthy juice. Everything here is made fresh for order. Great community spot I'm a repeat customer
19-Nov-22,Just had a fresh smoothie tried the Pineapple Jam. It was delicious and refreshing. We also ordered a coffee!
18-Nov-22,Saw that this place in my neighborhood was open so I stopped by for a fresh pressed juice and it did not disappoint! The staff was friendly and great at helping me make a selection. I ended up getting a Detox juice which was a great way to start my day. Will definitely be back with my kiddos to try the dessert options.
6-Nov-22,"Definitely a newly opened tucked away gem. Very glad we stopped in to try out this place. Would definitely recommend. They have an abundant menu with something for every palate and every age. Ice cream, milkshakes, treat bowls, smoothies, fresh juices...the list goes on. All customizable with unique and fresh add ins. My son got a simple vanilla shake and it was honestly one of the best I have ever had. My other son got a customizable shake with add ins and it was delicious. We will definitely be back to try more. Add to their menu and delicious creations the fact that the owner was extremely welcoming and personable from the moment we opened the door and you have a place that is bound succeed. Don't miss out on this place. It is a definite must try!"
26-Oct-22,"What a great new addition to the Southern Highlands area!  The location is a little hidden, off of Cactus and Dean Martin, but you'll be glad you came over.  Great juices, protein shakes, ice cream, and milkshakes. I haven't tried the acai bowls yet, but if they are as good as the rest of the menu, then I'm sure they'll be excellent.  Tonight I had the Roll N Dough milkshake, I highly recommend it.  Staff is great and very friendly, store is clean. Whether you're looking for a healthy juice/smoothie, or a dessert ice cream treat, this should be your new go-to spot."
26-Oct-22,This place is where it's at!! I love the combinations of the ice cream and how it's mixed together. It tastes great and there's endless options. I love the vibe and atmosphere in here. I have yet to try the smoothing but im looking forward to coming back again to check them out. Definitely give these guys a try if your in the area.
23-Oct-22,"10/10 for this fun and tasty treat bar. They have various options for cereal and candy mix-ins, which my kids loved in their ice cream. I ordered the paradise passion smoothie and it was the perfect blend of sweet and tart. It's definitely a great place to treat yourself. I will be back to try their a√ßa√≠ bowl and coffee."
22-Oct-22,So so so good!! The staff has such amazing energy so welcoming and knowledgeable! My go to place for protein shakes my favorite is the cookies and cream :)
17-Oct-22,This place is super cool .The smoothies are to die for . And their signature  ice cream treats are de my favorite.Great place for the kid but also a great place to hit after a workout as they have a wide selection of protein shakes with your favorite flavors. Plus Southern Highlands does not have anything like this. Must try !!!
17-Oct-22,"Thick & Thin treats are all so good! I got the a√ßa√≠ bowl, green goddess juice and pineapple magic smoothie. The staff was super friendly, quick and efficient. gray for kids and adults. Will be coming back for more!"
16-Oct-22,Is just opened. Took a long time with only 2People working for grand opening . The wellness shots are good and the smoothies. I was disappointed with the acai bowl it taste more like a protein shake then being more tart flavoring and little pricey. I took 45 minutes for 3 things.
