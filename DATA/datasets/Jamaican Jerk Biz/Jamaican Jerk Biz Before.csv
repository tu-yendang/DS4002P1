Date,Review
29-Oct-23,It was our first time trying tonight. That jerk bussin and the vibe was cool!! I drove 30 minutes to get it and would do it again.
28-Oct-23,"I really enjoyed my food and drink! Both quite tasty and freshly prepared. We both had the shrimp Rasta Pasta. I enjoyed the twisted sangria and he had the Kingston as our bar drinks . The service was mediocre, but no real complaints. They took the order, brought the food, and that's it. They didn't come back to check on us at all.  However, the 20% gratuity was added automatically, which was not stated anywhere that I noticed. I also don't like that food was served in styrofoam containers. 2 meals+ 2drinks= $90.95... I won't go back! It was good,  but not THAT good‚Äç"
21-Oct-23,Family Jamaican Restaurant I just love the energy and food here the Tacos and Rasta Pasta is the best
19-Oct-23,I Love This Place So Much. I Don't Mind Taking A 25 Min Drive From Douglasville EVERY TIME! The Food? DELICIOUS & HOT For You! Out Of All Jamaican Restaurants I've Ate At.. This One Is My Fave! The Ambiance Is Lovely Too!
18-Aug-23,Came in for lunch. The decor is very nice. It was somewhat empty but makes sense in the middle of the day. Was greeted immediately. The drink selection is pretty good. Tried the Rum Punch and it was great. Had the beef Patty and chicken Patty both good. Tried the jerk chicken and curry chicken both were seasoned well the chicken was moist. I only took a star because everything came in plastic or a To go container even though sat inside to eat. I will be returning you can tell it's a vibe.
8-Aug-23,Great place to get some get food and great drink. Very nice patio and hookah also. You will not be disappointed.
30-Jul-23,Our waitress was so sweet and transparent. The vibe was so relaxing and I would definitely come back with a big group or just a couple of friends. The music added to the atmosphere and THE FOOD WAS TOO GOOD. Hands down my favorite restaurant since moving to ATL.
27-Jul-23,I paid so much money for the scoops of food I had! I also invited 2 other couples to order! They were even more disappointed. I was so let down. Never Again
22-Jul-23,"Before even receiving my food I was honestly rubbed the wrong way by the speed and lack of sense of urgency by the kitchen/staff. I ordered on the phone and was told my food would be 20 minutes. It is a 35 minute drive from my home and when I arrived I still had to wait an additional 20 minutes after being told my food would be out in 5 minutes. I appreciate it not being cold when I picked up, but I called to avoid the wait. Upon walking in, the restaurant is kind of lounge style with high seated booths along the walls and tables. It wasn't super packed, but I went kind of early. I can see how it can become a vibe in the evenings with their music and atmosphere. They also had a bar you can eat at and order drinks. I wouldn't mind coming back to eat and do hookah for a girls night. Now despite the hiccups with the wait times, I still rated them a 4 because the food was THE BOMB. I found their prices to be reasonable (half the price of another local restaurant) and the portions large enough for me to eat the meal 2-3 times. I was craving oxtail and ordered the oxtail Rasta pasta and baby it was GOOOOOD!!! As you can see I started eating before I even snapped a picture. I didn't want to stop eating it. I will absolutely be back, but this time I will pack my patience."
16-Jul-23,I had the blackened salmon on the toss up salad and it was so good!   The oxtails are very delicious as well.  Great drinks and very good hookah's
14-Jul-23,"Not sure how the food taste yet...because I've been waiting an hour for it.  It's my first time visiting and I'm very disappointed because the staff are inefficient and there seems to be a lot of miscommunication between the kitchen and those distributing the food.  I've seen the staff open and close lids on orders in the company of customers 5x or more trying to figure out what order is which.  And there's a gratuity charge added to every tip, even to-go tips that's outrageous!  Not sure I would come back, even if the food is good."
12-Jul-23,"Good Jamaican food with great flavor and portioned. The ambience is amazing and reflective of the Jamaican cuisine, theirs a bar where you can order alcoholic drinks and beverages. Service was excellent."
11-Jul-23,"When I pulled up and saw Restaurant, Hookah, and Lounge, I instantly thought...here we go! Steeped in and I loved the openness, ambience, and cleanliness!! It looks like a quaint dinner spot with an outdoor lounge! The food was on point!!! I had the jerk wings and fries and oooooweeee! My daughter had the curry chicken plate and was in love! The food was well seasoned and perfect! We'll def be making a trip from the south side once a month to eat here!!"
11-Jul-23,This place has a really good vibe. The hookahs are good and so are the drinks. I like sitting at the bar and the bartender Smiley lives up to her name. She's very nice and smiles through it all and very polite. The food was also good too. Definitely going to be one of my new spots to come chill out.
9-Jul-23,"This spot is definitely a hidden gem! I absolutely love Jamaican food and decided to give them a try. I was amazed how flavorful and nicely spiced the food was. I ordered the Oxtail Rasta Pasta. It was perfection. The portions size was phenomenal for the price. My family ordered oxtail plate, jerk lemon pepper wings, and jerk salmon plate. They were all very pleased with their meals. We also tried the blue lagoon pitcher. We enjoyed that as well. I will definitely be returning! This is a MUST try spot!"
21-Jun-23,"To start this is my favorite Jamaican restaurant.  The salads, jerked meats, and Patties are delicious and spiced very well.  They always ensure your request for meat characteristics are correct ( I like mine medium).  The customer service is good and the servers are friendly.  They have a DJ on weekends but I have not been during those hours.  My only complaint is that they automatically add gratuity to your meal.  I have only dined alone and I am always a good tipper.  It gives me pause when as a single patron a restaurant includes the tip, as I feel that this regulation should only be reserved for groups.  The ambiance is nice and they have rolling videos of Afrobeats playing."
15-Jun-23,Oxtails are my favorite and I am very particular about how I like them cooked and I must say they were absolutely delicious! I am also all about the ambience - it's so cute and the music is loud enough to vibe but not too loud where you can hold a good conversation. Service was quick and everyone works together to make sure you are not without a drink or your entree. I hope to continue to see this black owned business thrive and I'm hoping they stay open late and maybe have a few good bands come through - go check them out !
12-Jun-23,I love this spot. The service is great and their food is always amazing. The vibe inside is really cool. They usually play Caribbean music but the sound isn't too loud. I have never dined in but when I've been multiple times for my takeout I noticed their dine-in customers got takeout plates as well. Curry Goat - my absolute favorite. There's a slight spice but it's not overpowering. The meat is so tender. Jerk Chicken - they got the flavor all the way down to the bone. It's so good! I added their scotch bonnet pepper sauce to mine because I love my food spicy.
18-May-23,The little light skin short waitress was adorable and friendly. The vibe was nice. I went there with a date during the day and we were the only ones in there. I suspect there would be a decent crowd an night. The food was just okay for me and my date. I had the oxtails and my date had the rasta pasta. I may try it one more time and taste the jerk chicken.
11-May-23,"I've only gone in to order pickup but I'm glad Mableton has a nice restaurant like this. It's decorated tastefully with red, black, yellow, and green. The dark green velvet seats look comfy. My only knock is that I don't think this place is kid friendly. I did not see any high chairs or booster seats and the restroom didn't have a changing table, even though it's very large. On my visit, I ordered the jerk chicken. It was nicely seasoned and grilled and came with steamed cabbage, plantains, and rice and peas. The mild jerk sauce came in a container on the side. I wished they asked if I wanted it in the side or in too because it didn't seem like enough, especially because I like gravy on my rice too. But oh boy, that sauce was so good. The rice and peas were standard and the cabbage was excellent. It was fresh cabbage that wasn't overly cooked like a lot of places. The cabbage also had bell peppers in it. Now that I've got the classic jerk out of the way, I can't wait to try one of the lunch specials (stew or curry chicken) or the jerk salmon."
7-May-23,Love this place!!! Obessed with the jerk chicken Rasta pasta & also have had just jerk chick w/ rice&peas cabbage. I was not disappointed loved every bite. Its all so full of flavor. Food so good really makes everyting irie Can't wait to try the rest of the menu!!!
7-May-23,"I was in the mood for sumn flavorful, so I decided to check this spot out since they had such great reviews.Plenty of parking, the young lady helping us seemed sweet, the rasta pasta was creamy - enough to feed 2, & came out pretty quickly. We took our order to go, but it was a nice, clean, & aesthetically pleasing spot. Oh, & the music was good too!I would come back."
6-May-23,"Cool spot with Jamaican flair. The decor is jazzy. I really like the cushy furnishings and the artwork. The bathroom is single stalled but pretty large with a cool full mirror good for bathroom selfies. Came in on a Saturday afternoon to a relatively empty restaurant. Service was a little slow. Our meals were served in to go plates as they do not have a dishwasher per our waitress. I got the pineapple chicken and my partner had the curry chicken. Both meals came with rice & peas, cabbage, and plantains and were tasty. Probably a very cool evening lounge option."
21-Apr-23,My favorite dish is the salad topped with jerk chicken and/or jerk shrimp!I usually sit near the bar where I can watch the videos of the songs being played as well.The food is so good that I forgot to take a photo today lol
13-Apr-23,this place is amazing the food was so good i ate the bone of my curry chicken lol...i recommend this place 100% also had the jerk shrimp it was unbelievably good everyone should go try this place u wont be disappointed.....love it
7-Apr-23,"Authentic Jamaican food, Amazing customer service and  the ambiance is so delightful. Highly recommended"
4-Apr-23,"I only order the seafood jerk dinners and let me tell you, the shrimp, salmon, and the fish are all very tasty. The staff are all friendly and not forgetting the ambiance, beautifully decorated. Lots of parking availableBy the way, the food is always FRESH, made to order."
1-Apr-23,"Had the pleasure of stopping by this establishment earlier while I was in the area. The service was a 10/10. The servers were sweet, helpful and attentive. I had the jerk chicken plate with rice and peas, cabbage and plantain. Everything was soooooo good. I didn't even get a chance to take a picture of my plate. I also had a pineapple guava drink which was super good as well. I took my plate to go but the ambiance was a vibe, somewhere I would definitely visit again."
30-Mar-23,"was looking forward to a jamaican restaurant being in the neighborhood.. the decor is ok.. the service was ok wasn't really anyone in there.. we ordered 2 oxtail dinners.. the flavor of the oxtail was cool but the gravy was watery, enjoyed the plantains.. i wanted white rice but they said they just ran out so i got the rice and peas and I believe it was parboil rice.. they don't have a liquor license yet so no alcohol and still not serving hookah... we dined in and they served our food in foam to go plates with plastic forks..honestly this should only be takeout for right now until they have everything in order.. will wait to comeback again in a few months when they have everything in order.. can't see myself paying full price to dine in and it's not full service.."
27-Mar-23,"Great customer service they were able to honor my order right before closing and food was A1. The girls upfront were friendly and all smiles after a busy shift. Plantains were HEAVENLY, jerk shrimp mild heat and sweet different than what I'm use to but welcomed difference. Rice n peas were tasty as well. Definitely worth a 2nd visit!"
24-Mar-23,"Pleasantly surprised with this restaurant! It's a small space, but it decorated so nice & has lounge seats, hightop tables, & lower tables. They also have TVs & music going. They just opened so they're still new (liquor license applied for), but their food is real good! The server was really sweet and paid attention to our table, making sure we were good. Also our food came out fairly quick (but it also wasn't crowded). The curry goat was cooked well & wasn't tough at all. The flavor was also delicious. The jerk chicken was bomb as well! The jerk sauce tasted like spicy bbq sauce, but it was still good. The Mac & cheese wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't great. Overall I'm so glad to have found a new Jamaican place with great prices & a cute vibe!"
24-Mar-23,"This place. We are lucky to have this place! Just DELICIOUS! Like you just keep looking at it. I declare, it's the best jerk in the City! The only thing close to me is Jamrock. These people just too the THRONE! They mean it! Jerk Biz is what they are about! There cabbage is Special!"
20-Mar-23,l had the jerk egg rolls and the pineapple chicken dinner this food was amazing. The service was very friendly and the whole restaurant is  a vibe.
18-Mar-23,"We really enjoyed Jamaican Jerk Biz!  When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by Pinky; the ambiance is great, then Ayanna talked with us about the menu choices and let me tell you....  Chef Jason's Jerk Shrimp Pasta was on point! Brown and Brian were also amazing. Great vibes, love the food, and excellent customer service.  We couldn't even leave without buying patties. We will be back!"
9-Mar-23,"I had the jerk chicken and I found the dish to be fresh and flavorful.  The staff was friendly and engaging. I think they are still experiencing a few new opening challenges, but I would definitely go again and try a different dish."
9-Mar-23,"I hate that I didn't get a picture of my oxtail plate but I am stuffed and it was absolutely amazing. They are a month in business and I'm so glad that I saw this spot on Google while searching for some Jamaican food.Yall check it out. The flavors are amazing. Oxtail banging, cabbage very good and the plantains are amazing. Although I was alone, the vibe is absolutely beautiful. I will definitely be back to try other things."
8-Mar-23,I had high hopes for the food here. Ordered the Brown Stew Chicken and it was just eh okay. I got the ends of a few chicken legs and some small cut up parts of chicken which wasn't enough to get full off of and the cabbage didn't have any seasoning on it. The restaurant itself is really cute inside though and as always try it for yourself.
4-Mar-23,Great food! Friendly staff! The ambiance is perfect for some delicious Jamaican food!
28-Feb-23,"Delicious food and great service! I got the jerk chicken rasta pasta and it was absolutely delicious. Flavorful, filling, and a kick of spice. Definitely coming back to this hidden gem!"
27-Feb-23,"The decor and ambiance of this place is nice and you get classy Caribbean vibes. I stopped by for a quick lunch, but would love to try visiting in the evening to see how the music and social vibes are. However my day time visit was lovely. The waitress was super nice and the food was definitely well worth it. I wanted to try something new for me so I got the pineapple chicken which comes with rice and peas, cabbage and plantains. Everything was flavorful so much so that I had to force myself to stop eating. The only teeny thing I had an issue with was them serving me my food in a to go container, which I'm sure their are legitimate reasons why, but I'm just not use to that while dining in. It devalued my experience a little because I'm a stickler for a good presentation. No worries though because like I said the food was really good so it made up for the presentation.Definitely recommend trying if you are in the area!"
25-Feb-23,"The food, service, and atmosphere was amazing. The decor is immaculate, you really feel like your in Jamaica...the music was great...but the food!! The food was on point! Definitely will be back."
23-Feb-23,So good! Great portions and always fresh. Would definitely recommend. We always get their food to go
17-Feb-23,"OMG!! This place is amazing inside, very spacious and comfortable.. The food is over the top delicious, I am glad I trusted my neighbors view. This is sooooo delicious as I am typing and eating this Jamaican jerk chicken. Service is ok as they are just opening a couple weeks ok but soooo friendly with big smiles."
12-Nov-20,"You just go there because the food smells so good from afar. Then after you taste the food you thank yourself for making a good ass decision. And then when you realize you're done you're mad because you want more. Anytime I'm in midtown, I go get my jerk fix."
