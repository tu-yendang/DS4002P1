30-Dec-22,Best pizza in town. Service is awesome too. Frank the owner is a nice guy and always makes sure you're taken care of. I usually always get it to go but it's cool watching them making it fresh as you wait.
17-Dec-22,Was just driving by looking for a meal with my partner and we noticed Frankensons because of the artwork on the outside of the restaurant. This was our first time trying and we will definitely be back and recommending to all our friends and family in the area. The prices are affordable and the customer service is phenomenal. The spinach artichoke pizza was delicious and flavorful. We also ordered garlic knots and meatballs w marinara that were homemade and you can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Overall I highly recommend and will be coming back regularly
11-Dec-22,Very good food! Been here about 5 times. The classic Italian sub is very good and the garlic knots are very buttery and garlicky.  I would recommend anything on the menu. Owner is very nice and makes sure you leave happy.
9-Dec-22,"Have grabbed to go pies the last few weeks and been very impressed. Pizzas are delicious, enjoyed wings and knots as well. Looking forward to trying more of the menu, this place is a great addition to the neighborhood. The owner was very friendly and welcoming when picking up. I really hope to see them do well!"
4-Dec-22,"The greek salad was absolutely incredible, and the margherita pizza was out of this world!! We can't wait to try more of the new menu!"
27-Nov-22,"Came here for brunch yesterday with the family and had an amazing experience.   Food was fabulous as was the customer service.  We loved the garlic knots - they're huge and perfectly buttery and garlicky. Pasta, pizza, wings, and zucchini planks were also great, and the portions are huge.  Glad we decided to try it for small business Saturday.   We will definitely be back.  Thanks, Frank!"
22-Nov-22,"So I've been coming here for slices or ordering pizza to go. Always enjoy their pizza and today was proof why I'll keep coming back.I got into the store and on my left was two people eating pasta and I had to do a double take cos their pasta looked so good. I apologized and Frank the man eating asked me if I would like some (also he's the owner, if you already guessed it) lol. They were on their lunch break and he ended up offering me some.I was like what?!?!Okay, I know this dont happen everyday but I looove pasta. And to be offered some on the spot, of course I will say yes!Anyway, I also got me two slices of pizza with pepperoni and mushroom, my favorite. The food...Their pizza is always great. Like I said, been coming here for pizza.The pasta, not sure if its on their menu but damn, thats one delicious chicken piccata.Definitely grateful this place is in my neighborhood."
19-Nov-22,Best quality food and you can tell it's made with love!! Fresh high quality ingredients favorite is Buffalo chicken pizza it's so good I haven't tried the bbq chicken pizza yet one day I will currently my childrens favorite pizza place
17-Nov-22,"Where do I start ! I stumbled upon this gem looking for something to eat, the staff were super friendly and insisted I try the classic Italian and  it was amaaaaaaazing. Pizza is off the hook too make sure you support this Family owned business I love family owned businesses that are genuine and make you feel at home. If you go in tell Frank (Ronnie) sent ya!"
14-Nov-22,"Loved the wings and homemade sauces! Add in the fact the staff is great, it's a must try place!"
14-Nov-22,"Excellent wings! Good size, solid crust and homemade sauces. The owner here is a really nice guy also!"
6-Nov-22,"I was craving pizza and not that fake domino's Pizza Hut type but something more authentic. After a ton of searching I found this gem. Frankensons is delicious! I love that all the food are made fresh. The sauce on the pizza had a garlicky delightful flavor. The cheese was perfectly melty. The crust is a little thicker then a typical NY style pizza, but that's the way I like it. It supports all those yummy toppings.  The customer service was on point. We were greeted right away and the cashier was super friendly. Everything came out super super hot and fresh! Will come back next time I'm in Vegas."
6-Nov-22,"Want fresh pizza? Head over here! You can see the dough being prepared as you're ordering. We came here in between game during a tournament at the Desert bloom park across the street. Half of team joined us and absolutely loved the food. The large pizza is no joke! We are a family of 6 and had left overs. Salad and bread sticks were good. I really liked their ranch dressing as well. Did not have a chance to try their wings which would help me rate it 5 stars assuming they would be awesome. If you're in town for a game at fields across the street, call ahead! The owner was super sweet and kept checking in on all of us. He also gave the girls a motivational speech which was cute and appreciated."
4-Nov-22,"First of all, customer service was just amazing. Your immediately given Hello and Welcomes. Smell of the food cooking is so welcoming. Highly recommend the wings with the home made Ranch and Bleu Cheese as well. The wings have actual meat on them, nothing like you would get from Little Ceasars or other pizza and wings place. Full of flavor and satisfaction. Most important the reasonable prices. I will be trying the burgers next.."
31-Oct-22,I just moved back to  Vegas from California (raised in NJ so picky about Italian food)- so excited that I live close to this restaurant.  The garlic knots are ON POINT with a lot of fresh garlic and olive oil - food is very good - highly recommend to locals and transplants from the east coast
31-Oct-22,"This place is great! I had mild wings w/ sweet potato fries, and garlic knots w/ pesto. Everything tasted amazing. Wings are huge, fries had a yummy toss of cinnamon sugar, and the garlic knots are perfectly baked to order! And the ranch, oh my gosh, amazing! (Made from scratch)The owner, Frank, was such a sweet guy. Checked in on us multiple times, and got us any and everything we could have possibly needed. I live like 20 min away, but I will, without a doubt, be back because I had such a great experience!"
31-Oct-22,"This review isn't for the pizza. Husband and I have come in a few times and ordered calzones and sandwiches. Every time we have come in, they offer amazing food and great service. I'm excited to try their pizza."
20-Oct-22,"It was our first time visiting Frankensons today and we were not disappointed! The food was delicious and the serving sizes were amazing for the price. We ordered a medium pizza and it was huge! The peach pineapple habanero wings were so tasty. The garlic knots had great flavor and the pizza was delicious, perfect amount of sauce! We highly recommend stopping by."
13-Oct-22,"I did not think I'd like the pizza here only because the 2 pizzerias in this spot prior were not good but they're really good! My husband picked up the pizza so I'm not sure how their decor or vibe inside is but the name of this pizzeria is not visible from the outside. Had the meat lovers pizza and I would definitely recommend it here! Don't let the 2 previous pizzerias keep you away from trying these guys, they are so much better."
10-Oct-22,"Their pizza is SO BOMB and I loved the milkshake I ordered too! I ordered myself a Stromboli and my daughter a personal pizza- I was expecting a pretty small pizza since it was on the kids menu, but this pizza was pretty big! Their portions are totally worth what you pay and the taste is great. Definitely ordering from them again!!"
10-Oct-22,"Amazing value, amazing food. Can't go wrong. Staff always friendly. I would suggest the zesty bbq wings as a must try"
17-Sep-22,"BEST FOOD AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! My fianc√© and I loved the name and decided to go here and we were not disappointed in the slightest with Frankensons! Frank, the owner was so kind and attentive! As well as the other employees. Frank is so genius with his recipes and all his innovative homemade sauces! And for all the ranch connoisseur's his sauce passes the test!!! We got the wings, jalape√±o poppers, and chocolate peanut butter shake. They all just melted in our mouths... literally. After being vegetarian for so long, we're very particular with our meat and it was the BEST wings we've ever had!!!!! We got Buffalo, although I wish we would have got the peach pineapple habanero!!!! I also wish we would have taken a picture of the wings, because they looked just as good as they tasted! Lol. We asked Frank what his favorite sauce was and he was sweet and excited to give us a taste of the peach pineapple habanero and our tastebuds were in food heaven! We will definitely be back to try all of the wings! As far as the shake and jalape√±o poppers... JUST DELICIOUS!!!! We couldn't stop talking about this hidden gem that we recommend for everyone! Especially if you want to walk out with a smile!"
1-Sep-22,"Ordered from here last night through a food app after checking their hours of operation on Google (stated it closed at midnight).  I placed my order at 9:35pm and it stated it was being prepared. I got dressed and drove ACROSS town only for it to be canceled right as I arrived. There was so much time in-between and yet nothing. For a brand new place this is already not a great way to build a clientele. The place had a grand opening sign and their open sign on with hours posted they were open until midnight. Yet it looked as if nobody had been there for hours if even at all. Complete waste of gas, time, and then had to drive to find food elsewhere because now a majority of other restaurants were closed at this point! Just awful experience!!!!!"
24-Aug-22,"BOMB. I rarely eat pizza and wings because its always a hit or miss, but FINALLY this place is satisfying every time. They just opened, we've been twice, but I can't wait to work my way through the menu. Lemon pepper wings the best i've had forsure. We've tried both a whole pizza and pizza by the slice, saucy while maintaining the crispy crust. The owner Frank makes all his sauces from scratch. From the ranch, blue cheese, and Caesar dressing. They have pastas and burgers that we will try next time. That damn peanut butter chocolate SHAKE! I literally have no words. Super dope family oriented spot, definitely bringing the whole family next time."
22-Aug-22,"Stopped by here on the way out of Vegas, got there shortly after opening. The food here is great, especially the spicy sausage that they use. Ordered a Stromboli, it came out in an appropriate amount of time, and the owner came by to check on us during our meal. I'll be adding this place to my list of recommendations for people to check out when they're passing through Vegas."
20-Aug-22,"The chicken wings were delicious but our pizza was very greasy. We had to wipe it off with paper towels before eating it! Once the grease was sopped up, the pizza was good.I'd definitely go back again."
17-Aug-22,"Great family owned place! I had the pleasure of walking in tonight and meeting the owner, Frank, he stayed open late just for me and cooked me a pizza (even though he usually didn't make pizzas himself). Very hard working man and by the way, when I got home the pizza tasted DELICIOUS! It might not have been the best looking pizza but I just took the first bite and can't wait to enjoy the rest of it. Their stuffed peppers are also very good! I gotta come back to try their wings bc they are jumbo sized and all their sauces sound tasty. Thank you, Frank and I wish you the best of luck and will come back to try more food!"
16-Aug-22,Driving around looking for a place that sold pie by the slice... Frankensons did not disappoint! Aside from the ridiculously large portion I had an extremely reasonable price the sauce and Cross were delicious. I was there at a super off peak hour so I don't know what service is like during busier times but I will definitely stop in again the next time I am in Vegas. The whole menu sounds great and the service was really friendly and helpful.
15-Aug-22,"In town visiting our son and decided to pick up pizza from a ""local"" joint (no Pizza Hut for us!). Was not disappointed!  The staff (owners?) we're genuinely friendly and appreciative. The pizza itself was great!  Great flavor and great crust (just crunchy enough). My son will certainly make this a place to order pizza!Love to support the local community small business."
11-Aug-22,Pizza was really flavorful and the cheese used tasted of quality. Cool logo and theme. The inside is roomy to enjoy a nice slice with a drink
11-Aug-22,"Place was clean and and the pizza was delish! Will be back to try other menu items, left a good first impression."
11-Aug-22,I came in for a quick bite to eat and found this place to be my new favorite place to eat. I had the relish burger and habanero peach wings. SO DELICIOUS! They make all their own sauces for their wings and ranch! Can't wait to go back try everything on the menu.
10-Aug-22,We tried this spot a few days after they opened. Coleslaw needs some work.  Not very good. The wings were great!  Cooked well and were crispy just the way we like them!  The homemade sauces were also good except the ranch has a dill flavor to it. Pizza was good-lil more greasy then I would prefer but overall was tasty. Will go back
29-Jul-22,Loved it!!!!! Super cute spot with relaxing vibe perfect to enjoy a solid slice of pizza and cold soda in this Vegas heat! I highly recommend
29-Jul-22,"New Pizzeria spot that just opened up! This place has such a cool vibe and they have a lot to offer on their menu!They make everything fresh and from scratch! From their dough, marinara, ranch, blue cheese, sauces, and much more. It does take a bit of time to prepare but well worth the wait. They also serve chicken wings, calzones, strombolis, subs, pasta, burgers, appetizers, and much more!Inside is very clean and the staff is friendly. They have a pretty big dining area where you can sit and enjoy your food.Huge PLUS is they are open late! Weekends they are open until 2am! Owners name is Frank and he is such a character. I would highly recommend checking this place out and I will definitely be back."
