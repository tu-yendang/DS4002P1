25-Aug-24,"Really wanted to enjoy this restaurant, but I was a little disappointed. I popped in for lunch and decided to try despite the different reviews. Some guests said they really enjoyed everything and some said it was just okay. I ordered the jerk wings since I saw that many people ordered them as well. But the wings are extremely small. I normally don't mind small wings and didn't expect them to be jumbo sized but that was disappointing. Because the wings are crispy, some parts of the wing were overcooked and hard to bite through. They serve them with a side of fries, but for the price I would have liked to have 2 sides? I had jerk wings with fries and an alcoholic drink... my tab was $39 dollars. If I try again, I would consider a to go order, but I'd steer away if you do not want to spend $40 for two items.",-0.0829
25-Aug-24,"Good food and service but have them break down your bill and look at the receipt before paying. I feel kind of ripped off because I was charged for a 20% gratuity twice. And when I came back inside to ask about it, all the waitress said was ""Sorry about that."" Not cool.",-0.4841
25-Aug-24,Order food at inside 3:20 pm get my food at 4:00 pm the young lady had an attitude They totally lost on what you ordered Bypass this place,-0.3804
9-Aug-24,The worst customer service I've ever received. The snapper was mushy and I asked to have it remade and the owner/manager stated that he would not remake it but would charge me for the whole meal and not give me the meal I paid for. Terrible. I will NEVER come here again. I wish there were negative stars. The owner smoked hookah instead of resolving the issue. Unacceptable.,-0.8689
9-Aug-24,"Cool atmosphere especially for late night but I came for lunch. The stewed chicken was good for $11 on the lunch menu, everything was fresh. I don't believe the wings are fried, so was missing the crispy aspect and the fries were just normal. The service was nice as well. I would come back to try them again.",0.8906
7-Aug-24,"I recently tried Jamaican Jerk Biz as it is one of the few restaurants near me. I tried to place an order online; however, that was not an option and I had to call-in the order, (which is not a big deal at all). When I went to pick up my order and pay, the total was $17.85; however, the price for my entree on the menu was $14. So ""of course"" I had the option to add a tip on top of this $17.85 amount and I kindly declined; however, that is when I asked the hostess why the price was almost $18 in the first place. She said we add 18% gratuity to all orders including to-go. The problem is that nowhere on their website does it say anything about adding 18% gratuity to to-go orders. I felt like it was a scam and I don't like to feel scammed. So I paid and laughed at the fact that she was asking for an additional tip that she had already added. I vowed not to return as those are poor business practices. And it's really a shame because I have a large family and would love to have more diverse options for ordering in this area, but if I ordered food for my whole family with an automatic 18% gratuity, who knows how much my total would be.  The food itself was just ok. I got a lot of rice and only a scoop of chicken. The cabbage had no seasoning. It also was giving hookah lounge vibes more than restaurant... which is so Atlanta.",0.6581
25-Jun-24,"U decide!!! 45 min wait before I got a cup of water n able to order. The 2 ladies who came in behind me suffered the same wait time. You would've thought you had to order your food through an app because there was no sign of a waitress. All food comes in black plastic ""to-go"" boxes with a plastic spork.  Menu stated Caesar salad $10.00 Add shrimp or chicken or beef $13.00. What I received in a plastic to go carton was some chopped up lettuce  only ( I promise u) n 4 shrimp on top. My bill for that $26.00. Lettuce retails $2.18, 4 shrimp .37 x 4 = 1.48.  The jerk salmon was cold n dry. Yellow rice sticky. The young waitress still had her see through one piece jumper on from the club the night before. ( No lie...did not mind the visuals) And O yes! , plenty of attitude like I was wasting her time to want to order. She said menu was clear about salad. I missed the memo that n Mableton one pays for a takeout of a half head of lettuce n 4 grilled shrimp for $26.00 ?!? Total takeout $48.00. I would not dare tip. The days are gone that to patronize a black own restaurant one has to endure this ... ish. My prediction this place will not last 6 months. To many quality black owned dine in  restaurants available with respectable service. PS ... l was going to stay n eat but I did not want to catch a case on a Sunday. At home I added tomatoes, olives, cheese n balsamic vinegar that made my ""lettuce salad"" pop. Added garlic Parmesan dressing to salmon and water to rice and salvaged my meal. U have been warned... spend your money wisely...Peace ...",0.4728
8-Jun-24,"The food was delicious, I had the shrimp rasta pasta. I will say everything comes in plastic or styrofoam which was very sanitary but some people may say ""tacky"". The wait time was also 30+ minutes for our order and we saw many to go orders come and go. Overall 4/5!",0.3903
7-Jun-24,"Food was absolutely delicious! We got the brown stew chicken and the curry goat. It was fresh, hot and plenty of food too.",0.7639
3-Jun-24,"Keith Lee, must've been sadly mistaken, because I visited this location on Saturday, June 1 & I must admit, I don't think I'll ever return. I ordered the jerk pasta and added chicken.The blandest ""jerk"" pasta that I've ever tried. My cousin ordered the jerk chicken entree and the chicken was very dry. We ordered drinks; Don Julio rep with splash of cranberry, she brought back a cup, no ice and Don Julio and cranberry mixed. I would've left an addition star but the server we had must've been having a bad day because she appeared to be in a very bad mood.I left this exact review on Google and here is how the owner responded: ""Thanks again for you taken the time out your busy day to give us your 1 star review we really appreciate it.. Have a safe and blessed day.""",0.5089
10-May-24,"Nice addition to the neighborhood! The servers/bar tenders/hostesses are always very nice. I tiried the pineapple chicken and my hubby had the curry chicken, both were really good and so are the chicken patties!! The beef were ok but I like the crust on the chicken best!! Whatever yall are doing to the chicken patties -- please keep it up!",0.9629
3-May-24,"I had the Jerk Shrimp with a side of Jerk Chicken. The chicken was bomb! Authentic Jamaican Jerk, tender inside, seasoned skin, hint of smoke. The shrimp came with cabbage, Rice & Peas. The jerk sauce has onions and peppers  LIKE THAT.",-0.8342
1-May-24,I come here for the jerk patties often there real good! Today I decided to actually get a meal. I got the jerk Rasta pasta & it was a hit !,-0.3578
17-Apr-24,Great food!  The oxtails were awesome.  My husband had the curry goat and loved them.  We had a great experience.  Check them out.,0.9551
7-Apr-24,"I decided to stop by Jamaican Jerk Biz on a Saturday since it's not too far from the middle school I work at.Parking is always easy to find, which is a breath of fresh air in Atlanta. I was in the mood for dinner and good music. As soon as I walked in the door, I was met with just what I was looking for! The waitresses told me I had to dance upon entering, and being a good sport, I did! Since I was dining alone, I took a seat at the bar and the bartender with the short blonde cut immediately gave me a menu and cup of water. I ended up ordering the Veggie Rasta Pasta and a cup of Crown regular with a splash of sprite. I truly appreciate the chef at this business so much! I haven't been here in a while but the food was still amazing! Just the right amount of seasoning and spices and the temperature is perfect! It was so good I forgot to take a picture. I completely devoured my entire meal.They do charge 20% gratuity regardless of party size, which I was aware of because it was stated on the menu, however, I didn't realize there was a price difference for paying in cash vs. card. I believe it was $1 or so.  Overall, I wasn't expecting to pay almost $40 for a solo meal ($13 for crown and $16 for Veggie Rasta Pasta) but it was well worth it. I will continue to return as long as the chef continues to cook the way he/she does! I probably would have stayed for another drink if the dj didn't change the music genre to R&B.",0.9837
28-Mar-24,"Only got the jerk chicken rolls so far, had to be the best egg rolls I tasted ever. Service was not too long, place was not too busy at all. Employees are great.",0.7845
16-Mar-24,The drinks were good. The oxtail meal was a huge disappointment. I had only had 4 oxtails with no meat. The only meat were strands in the gravy. I feel cheated.,-0.5574
16-Mar-24,"Great Food, decent service. We took our food to go! I recommend the Red Snapper. The drinks are amazing.",0.8932
7-Mar-24,"Oh my gawd. This Rasta Pasta is da truth! Best pasta dish I ever had. Came for lunch, can't wait to come back for dinner to really enjoy the vibe.",0.883
27-Feb-24,I have the Rasta pasta and and my girl had another pasta forgot which one I thought the total would be about 40 but it came out to 65 dollars! For pasta that barely had any jerk flavoring. I was charged gratuity when are server just handed us sum food never checked on us nothing until the bill came was charged 10$ extra? And taxes up to 5 dollars like are you crazy! If this was more of a mom and pop shop and the pasta was actually cheaper then 20 dollars then it would be 5 star but don't go here if u expected cheep or fair prices for pasta just go to twisted kitchen or olive garden,-0.5557
21-Feb-24,"This spot is fine if you're starving. I had jerk chicken, rice and peas, cabbage, and plantain dish. The chicken was fine (wasn't quite there), and the cabbage was a little on the saltier side (I'm used to having a cabbage that has that little sweetness to it). The plantains weren't sweet either. Rice and Peas are rice and peas, so no complaints there.I don't waste food, so I continued eating it. The server didn't come around much (I'm okay with this as this is the common theme with Jamaican restaurants (YouTube Rasheed Thurmond stand up). Also, FYI gratuity is added automatically. When you get your receipt to sign, there is a tip line on there so I can see why folks tip twice. Hkl deal on my end because I actually look at my bills so I don't end up getting played, but I can see how others may not notice. In short, I've had better Jamaican food at Golden Crust, and that's saying a lot. Will I come here again, probably not.",0.6025
7-Feb-24,My card information was compromised by one of the waitresses here and they tried shopping at multiple online clothing stores.Definitely overpriced priced for two people. It was $107 for lunch. Two plates and pitcher of rum punch $107.,0.0
31-Jan-24,"Arrived there were only about 4 other customers. Ordered Oxtails they were tough, not edible. The Owner refused to switch to a different entree or serve allow for another entree to be ordered. Extremely rude belittling and condescending. I was there for a birthday dinner with my mother. He was extremely out of line especially talking to someone his elder. Never going back, disheartened and disgusted that any man would feel like his behavior or aggression was ok. Also no consideration for complaints he told her she didn't know what oxtails were supposed to taste like. Run!",-0.7233
30-Jan-24,"I ordered the oxtails with collard greens, rice, and peas through UBER EATS. The food was amazing and packaged well. It was also still fresh when it arrived...shout out to my delivery person that night. It's definitely worth it.",0.8957
29-Jan-24,"Stepped in this place looking for some good eats and was very disappointed with the food. I ordered curry chicken figuring you can go wrong at a Jamaican spot. Boy was I wrong, mushy rice and un-tasty curry chicken. I have had better at golden crust. They served the food in black to go containers and drinks in plastic cups. To top it all off they charge gratuities and ask for tips? The place loos good but don't go for food.",-0.012
28-Jan-24,"This place was a hard miss. I went on a Friday night, I'll start by saying that I didn't get the Jamaican buzz while eating at Jamaican jerk biz. The flavors of the food smh...I got the jerk chicken, rice & peas, cabbage, and plantins. The food took 20 minutes to come out right under luke warm. The chicken tasted like it was made in a BP gas station...the rice tasted like rice, cabbage was okay. The only thing that made the plate digestible was the jerk sauce that I had to request because it doesn't come served with the food. My girl got the curry goat with the same sides I got she also had the same disappointing results....food very cold and bland. Did I mention the food in the dine in area is served in styrofoam boxes and plastic utensils? Wouldn't be an issue, but there's a 20% gratuity automatically added to the bill which makes no sense because I could've to my cold food back to the crib if that was the case. Ambiance wise the place was just as bland as the food. I forreal could've took my cold bland food home if I knew I'd be sitting in a Caribbean restaurant listening to nba youngboy, lil Jon, & coi larey. I honestly don't think a soul that works at the restaurant is a bit of Caribbean. Oh did I forget to mention that you also get charged a extra dollar to pay for your meal with a card instead of cash...... yes a restaurant charges youmore to pay with a card on top of the mandatory 20% gratuity. 2/10 experience. I'd say 0/10 but the waitress was at least nice.",0.7615
19-Jan-24,"We haven't tried the food yet so I have given it a 3. However, the customer service has guaranteed a no return. The woman who answered the phone appeared pleasant initially but wasn't accommodating in any regard. After need to change my order due to the restaurant being out of items like white rice at 2 in the afternoon, we decide to proceed and continue our order. Once we arrived, about 20 minutes past the designated time for pick up we were met with an attitude by the lady with a cute blond hair cut. The additional wait for them to slowly plate the food would have been fine, except her attitude made the experience not pleasurable. We were left with a bad taste in our mouth before even sampling their cuisine. Come only if you are prepared to deal with staff who feel they are doing you a favor by serving you.",0.5908
17-Jan-24,"3 stars, not 5 for the following reasons:The ""jerk"" ain't really jerk... iykykThe peas and rice was hittin 4 sho'The rum punch is fire butthe wings are skimpy.,Hope this helps",0.1531
16-Jan-24,If you're in the A check them out! And do yourself a favor and get the pasta.....Kinda pricey but definitely worth it!,0.8092
6-Jan-24,"I am not one to eat leftovers or visit an establishment frequently given all of the culinary options in metro ATL. This place is the exception! I phoned in an order on Friday night after getting stuck in traffic on 285. This place popped up as a solid option so I decided to give them a try. The young lady that took my order was so pleasant and helpful since I could not fully read the menu while driving. My order was ready as soon as I walked inside and  it was hot, nicely packaged and DELICIOUS! So much so, I went back on Saturday for lunch and had a similar dining experience. This time I had a guest and we ordered a pitcher of drinks which were tasty & balanced, jerk shrimp egg rolls, ox tail tacos and jerk honey bbq wings. IMHO, the wings were just a tad too salty for me but not my guest. We also ordered 2 different types of pasta to go. They have a relaxed vibe and good energy from start to finish. I will definitely be back again soon.",0.9698
16-Dec-23,"I was turned onto this restaurant the other day by a friend. She and I went in and had a late lunch. The young lady with the short blonde hair was our server. Everything was just fine until it was time to check out. When we went to check out the young lady charged us twice for gratuity. When we asked for one of the tips back she told us she couldn't do it. My friend asked if she void the transaction the server said no she couldn't. My friend asked if she could give it back in cash. She said no. She said the manager wasn't there to make any changes and we'd have to give them our number. My friend said don't worry about it she would be back and she just wouldn't tip her when she came back. So it's strange how our check was originally 66 dollars but ended up being 88 dollars and we couldn't get one of the tips back. Second experience with this restaurant I called them to place an order over the phone last night around 9. I was able to place the order without any issues. I left and took my food home. Now today, I called at 5:56 to place a  to go order for my family. The lady over the phone informed me that they were out of chicken and I'd have to wait an hour so I hung up to call my husband to see if he wanted to wait an hour. I called back at 6:03 for them to tell me they weren't taking orders over the phone. I said just called and spoke with someone and told her I had to get confirmation that my husband wanted to continue with the order. She said that was fine but we'd have to place the order in the store. I explained my dissatisfaction and disappointment with this issue. And I also explained how I was willing to continue patronizing the restaurant even though the young lady wouldn't refund the additional tip she took. So I ended the call. About 5 minutes later I received a call from the blonde head server from her personal phone saying she doesn't appreciate me implying that she stole the money and if the manager didn't call that wasn't her fault. I went on the explain myself and I asked her if she thought her calling me and telling me what she didn't appreciate was professional and she hung up in my face. I will never eat anything else from this place again and I do not recommend it. They are extremely unprofessional! The food doesn't compensate for piss poor service. My husband ended up going up there to get some food because he desperately had a taste for it. He spoke with the manager whom was very dismissive. My husband said his experience when he went inside was they were rude to him as well. I'm disappointed because we try to support small black owned businesses. But I need yall to get it together.",-0.9697
2-Dec-23,"Great music, friendly service, and solid food describe Jamaican Jerk Biz. The bartenders weren't quite as attentive as I would've hoped. They left money on the table since I wanted more to drink but didn't see them until I was wrapping up my meal.  The prices and portions are fair and the portions reasonable but the best part was the ambiance.  Comfortable seating and great music. I would visit if I happened to be in Mapleton again.",0.9774
28-Nov-23,"I saw Keith Lee's review and I had to try the food. I'm a huge pasta lover. I came on a Sunday. I wanted to call it in, but no one answered the phone. When I arrived, it was packed! My boyfriend and I both ordered rasta pasta. He got the salmon. I got the shrimp (shout out to the server who convinced me to get shrimp instead of chicken). I was worried about the quantity of shrimp, but I got a good amount. The pasta was so good! My only remark is I wish it was spicy. I added red pepper flakes when I ate the rest the next day and that gave it the kick I was looking for. We ordered a drink at the bar while waiting for our food. The drink was strong and good. I definitely will be back!!",0.9804
21-Nov-23,"Good food very flavorful but why is everything served in to go boxes and plastic cups for drinks if this is a restaurant our bill was over 100 dollars and I just found it strange, will definitely return but will probably just get it to go",0.5106
16-Nov-23,"I stopped by to pick up dinner for myself and my husband. There was a nice young woman working behind the bar, and she offered some suggestions of popular dishes to try. I ordered the jerk chicken rasta pasta, and oxtails. The food was kinda pricy, but it was very tasty. The restaurant had a sort of energetic vibe. It's definitely worth checking out!",0.8821
9-Nov-23,"Was in town for business conference and drove from the Congress Center for Jerk chicken that is supposed to be their claim to fame.  I was not impressive based on my experience with Jamaican food!  Honestly, being married to a carribbean queen I expected better!Disappointed!!",0.4526
7-Nov-23,"My nephew from Washington state found this restaurant and wanted to try it. We had a group of seven and were there right before the kitchen closed. They gave us a table and made sure the kitchen stayed open for our order! The food was amazing!! I gave it 4 stars because the setting is more bar like than restaurant - granted we were there on a Saturday evening. But our waitress, the chef who came out to talk to us, and the food were awesome! Thank you for giving us a great meal and an evening together bonding with family.",0.9782
4-Nov-23,Was looking forward to this place since I live close. Waited an hour for jerk chicken pasta that was just okay. Nice restaurant on the inside through. Waiter didn't even know if we had paid for our food or not ...it was a dance just to pay for the food.,0.2263
1-Nov-23,"Terrible customer service. Especially the lady with the dreads. Staff showed no urgency with the orders as they walked around and played around in the restaurant. After waiting 1 hour for my food the woman with the dreads talked as she bagged up my order then barked at me for reaching for the bag. Saying ""Just take the bag since you got your hand out."" Food was too subpar and over priced for them to have this terrible of customer service just go to another Jamaican restaurant it's not worth it.",-0.79
31-Oct-23,Went for lunch the food was delicious and the service was even better. Will be back for date night.,0.765
