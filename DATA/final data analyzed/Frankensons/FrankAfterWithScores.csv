19-Sep-24,Phone order my pizza. 2 medium. They said give them 35/45mins. Ok cool. Waiting an hour and headed to pick up my pizza 5 mins away. Get there and they haven't started on my order yet. So I left. Couldn't tell you if the pizza was good or not,0.7506
16-Sep-24,The Italian sub is the best I have ever tasted!!! The garlic knots were HUGE and so good!! Sorry I didn't take pics this time I just enjoyed. Say hi to Frank he was so kind and the service impeccable.,0.9622
3-Sep-24,This used to be one of my favorite places.  I think the new staff isn't as kind or nice as the old staff.  Frank himself is still cool.  I hope he gets better though.I still recommend this place.,0.9122
30-Aug-24,"Owner greeted us with a strange story with a side of racist comments! My encounter with him was disturbing and uncomfortable.The Italian sub was tasty, but not exceptional.",-0.5848
28-Aug-24,40+ minutes for a small pizza. ridiculous. people who ordered after me got their food before me. not worth it. would not come again unfortunately,-0.2801
25-Aug-24,"I was so excited to try the viral pizza joint in town finally got a chance since they are so far from me and just wow! The prices def expensive ! Wasn't worth the drive at all, the pizza was cold, mid af and expensive I asked for 2 slices and it was $10!!! Like wtf expensive af no lunch special nothing at all! Pizza was missing cheese and over cooked at bottom. a Caesar salad is $12!!! lettuce cheese and croutons! I told the guy that I went on Grubhub due to Google not having the information for their wings listed, and their website not working that the prices are significantly cheaper; a slice of pizza is $2.75, The salad was only 6.99, wings were $7 for 6 wings. when I asked the cost of the wings for six wing pieces I was advised it was $13. For four slices of pizza, a Caesar salad came to over $35 INSANE!!! I don't understand how they expect people to spend this kind of money to keep their business open when the prices have been hiked so and they are in the middle of Maryland parkway. I hope they do better for the owners sake . I will never be back, as a east coast girl this pizza was mid 2/10.",0.8106
25-Aug-24,"Almost all the reviews on here are positive,  so we thought we would try it. The first time, they burnt our calzone, so they had to make a new one. When we got it home, there was more bread than filling. Needless to say, we were disappointed. We called and spoke to the owner who offered to replace it. We took him up on our the other day and ordered our replacement along with 12 wings. We got the food home and once again were disappointed. The wings were soggy and I found a long dark hair in the canzone. Unfortunately, I'm now turned off by this place and wine be back.",-0.6124
24-Aug-24,Didn't care for the pizza and wings at all. Both were extremely soggy. The garlic knots were good but as a complete meal it was lacking.,0.0351
24-Aug-24,"Great spot. We found this place from Keith Lee, and he had it highly rated. He's dead on the pizza is fantastic, great pepperoni and cheese. Not quite NY style. Little thicker crust, but it's really good. The Buffalo wings also were great. We will be back.",0.9388
23-Aug-24,"This location had one of the best pizzas I have had in a long time!!! The ITALIAN SUB OMGGGGG!!!! I will be returning tomorrow for this sub. When I love something I love it. The wings were cooed well and not to well that they were dry. The sauce was all over the wings. We had peach mango HABANERO!! First time trying this def will have again!!! The Buffalo, lemon pepper and bbq were very tasty. Fries fresh and not too hard and not to sauce. Not to mention the customer service. The owner himself came and talked to us asked for feedback back and gave suggestions and he was not wrong!!!! Try this amazing little secret! Across from a park but one get one on Tuesday and Thursday pizza, Wing Wednesday $1.00 a wing and FRI THROUGH SUNDAY GET WINGS SUB FRIES AND PIZZA ALL FOR $60 and let me tell you it was four adults and we have leftovers!!!!!! I am in AWE!!!!",0.9293
21-Aug-24,My family LOVES Frankensons! I had been coming pretty regularly even a few months before they got popular. The food has always been SO GOOD! The owner and his family are so great and they remember their regulars! The baked ziti is honestly better than other restaurants like Olive Garden and like half the price! And the zucchini planks with the house sauce is TO DIE FOR! I recommend this place to everyone I know! Thanks you guys!,0.9863
18-Aug-24,Best pizza and wings for someone who's been in Vegas for over 20 years. The customer service is unmatched.,0.5994
13-Aug-24,"Another Foodie stop on Vegas stop that did not disappoint. A bit of a drive from the strip, but we'll worth it!Loved the owner! So personalable! So hands on! Trust me I'm in this industry and that's rare.....We tried 4 different kind of wings.They were all good except we didn't like the habinaro ones with the green sauce. Lemo pepper though... 10Garlic..... 10Buffalo...8Another plus, is they make all there dressings. That Ranch was bomb!!!All the staff was great to!",0.9488
13-Aug-24,The wings at this place are big and really good. The pizza on the other hand is more like Costco pizza but it's made there.,0.624
7-Aug-24,The food here is SO GOOD!!! I love to come here whenever I visit Las Vegas! Their wings are my favorite! So crunchy and crispy!,0.9433
28-Jul-24,"It was first time trying Frankensons and it was a great experience and will definitely return. Got medium pizza, dozen wings with 2 flavors and baked ziti. It was way more food than we expected.  Everything was so fresh and made to order.  You can taste freshness. Their medium size pizza is bigger than your average.  Originally we were gonna get a large but after we saw the box size we decided to get medium instead.   You definitely get your money worth with the amount of food they served. The owner was the one took our order and he's so sweet and attentive.  It has a good size dinning room for dine in too.  We did take out but it would be a great spot to eat with family and friends too.  While waiting for our food. I was studying the menu. They offer a lot of options and will definitely come back and try other dishes.",0.988
25-Jul-24,"Worst pizza I've ever had in my life. I had the margarita and it had ricotta on it. Disgusting, The dough was not the best customer service wasn't the best. The peach wings were good. The fries were just not impressed with the food.",-0.9311
22-Jul-24,"Yes, we went because of the Keith Lee hype.My friends and I ordered through the phone and were told to come by in 30 minutes. We drove over and were greeted by the owner (we also had our order taken by him).We got an 18 inch pepperoni pizza, 6 count lemon pepper wings, 12 garlic knots, and Caesar salad. My friends also grabbed a soda each and we ordered extra ranch. All of that with tip totaled to around 80 bucks, which we didn't think was too too bad (cheaper than anything on the strip!!!)We took our food to go and ate at our hotel. We all thought the pizza was average and the lemon pepper wings were good sizes (flavor was fine, nothing too intense). The real star was the garlic knots--I didn't have any but my friends loved them. I still think this was a nice stop on our trip. We always love to try and support local businesses and we were happy to not spend an arm and a leg on food that could've been 3x more expensive on the strip.",0.9875
20-Jul-24,Easily the best pizza in Vegas. Arguably some of the best garlic knots I've ever had. The people they were so nice and the guy was very nice and talk to me and my friends. It was really fun too. They had episodes of family feud playing on the TV and it was fun watching them while we ate. An easy recommendation.,0.9828
17-Jul-24,"Nope. I'm not sure if the situation has changed here but it is not worth it. In my opinion. It is overpriced and unsanitary. Sometimes I think, although I love me some Keith Lee, if a place is not ready for the abundance of service they are going to have to maintain after going viral they will tank. I feeling like this is the situation for Franks. I hope they survive but it's not looking promising. The food grade is a C . Like the health department gave them a C ... sorry frank.",0.9053
15-Jul-24,fantastic is the word that sums this place up in a nut shell ....the foodthe service the ownerdid i mention the food?very nice people wokring here ......i hope you all go enjoy franks food hes a great guy,0.9485
13-Jul-24,Air conditioning isn't working in dining area. Pizza is ok. Ok for carry out. Do not make plans to dine in.,0.5267
10-Jul-24,"Me: ""I'll take the classic Italian sub.""Them: ""We don't have any subs right now""I tried them once before ordering the Keith Lee items (thought I did a review, but obviously didn't) finding them to be slightly above average.",0.0
8-Jul-24,"This place was AMAZING, I cannot say it enough. They opened at 10am the girls had the door unlocked and allowed my family to sit inside until they could fire up the grill and open their register. The owner came out and was super nice and engaged with us during our meal even though he was recently out of the hospital. The food though.... We ordered a small cheese pizza, the regular and spicy chicken sandwich and the lemon pepper wings, holy cow everything did NOT disappoint the flavors bursting through were grade A. Definitely a spot I'll bookmark for my next trip to Vegas",0.9476
5-Jul-24,"Like most of you, we came because of the Keith Lee review. We ordered the same large pepperoni pizza, it didn't even look the same to the one in the video. It had no flavor, tasted like cardboard. The kind of pizza you'd expect from a bowling alley snack bar. We also ordered the lemon pepper wings, which were meaty but lacked flavor as well. Customer service was also bad. We were not greeted when we walked in and waited 5 minutes for someone to actually ask if we had been helped yet.We just threw the whole pizza in the trash and now looking for somewhere else to get food.",-0.5301
5-Jul-24,We ordered everything Keith Lee ordered and Frank you did not disappoint!!!  The food was great and you were so nice and welcoming.  I live across town it would be great if you delivered.  10/10 can't wait to come back.,0.959
3-Jul-24,This place is great amazing food quality the people the owner Frank is awesome best pizza in Vegas!!!,0.9588
2-Jul-24,"A friend of mine saw all the hype on social media and swears by this place. I had never been but I enjoy a a good wing and since we were in town takimg care of business we went. I have to say i was impressed. Cozy and non pretentious family joint. I like wings that are NOT dipped in anything and and are still flavorful, and these wings hit the spot; i got ywo flavors. Didn't try anything else because i had just eaten White Castle and didn't wanna be a glutton. The staff seemed toing and new but my order was correct. The owner was in the back taking care of business and popped out to chat. I like that! It wasnt busy at all. My only criticism is they need to keep up on the cleaning. It wasnt geoss or anything but the tables could have been cleened and there were straw papers in tandom places. Despite that, Iwill be back!",0.9617
30-Jun-24,"Overall, very disappointed with the entire experience. I was super excited to try Frankensons out for the first time tonight after remembering how they went viral on TikTok. While ordering the pizza they were out of the sausage and meatballs so I ended up ordering just a small pepperoni pizza. Went to order wings too, but sadly they weren't available. Since those were out of stock decided to try their garlic knots. While waiting for the food, I saw floats and shakes on the menu and by the door. We went to order a shake and were told that they don't carry ice cream anymore... So why is it advertised on the menu and in other places in the store? Realized I forgot to order ranch and they still charged me 75 cents for it even though they didn't have practically anything that I wanted to try.Even with the issue with the toppings, wings and shakes, I was still excited to try the food. When I got home and opened the pizza box, I was utterly BAFFLED by the lack of toppings. For $2 a topping I was expecting more than an average of 1&1/2 pepperonis per slice. I get more pepperoni on a little Cesar's pizza! The pizza tasted ok, but it was sorely lacking in toppings. It was mostly crust. The garlic knots were not great either. Because of their sheer size, there's very little flavor. It was like biting into a dinner roll with a hint of garlic. Blatantly disappointed.Employee's were nice and the place was clean I guess...",0.5113
28-Jun-24,They left hair in my food and wouldn't return our money. They're gross. Greasy forsure. Won't be coming back if you paid me! If it's free and I'm hungover I'm not eating their pizza.,0.126
20-Jun-24,"we so wanted to like it after Keith Lee reviewed it, but sadly, we just couldn't. There was hardly any cheese on the pizza. The place also felt  dirty. The soda machines did not work, and the chicken wings were very fatty with thick skins we ended up throwing half of them out. For  a buy one get one pizza free night, the place was empty.  We did complain to the girl that was working at the counter about there not being any cheese on the pizza, and she offered us an order of garlic knots on the house, which we declined, we already had enough dough on this pizza. an offer of a pizza with cheese on it would have been a better suggestion. I so wanted to like this place being that it is so close to home sadly I just couldn't. We won't be going back. Sorry, Frankensons maybe we just caught you on an off day.",-0.5143
17-Jun-24,"I ordered on Saturday for 1pm pick up and was underwhelmed. I had ordered 3 large pizzas and 24 garlic knots and spent $125. The pizzas had very little cheese and very little toppings. Me and my coworkers counted 14 pieces of pepperoni on a large pizza, the plain cheese had such a small amount of cheese we can see the dough underneath. The knots were decent but some were undercooked. I truly felt embarrassed bringing my colleagues this pizza after hyping it up so much from Franks online persona. I'm not sure if this is the standard portion now but I do know this will be the only time I order from there.",-0.2127
9-Jun-24,"Served me wings with hair cooked into the breading.  I brought the food back knowing that one issue in a kitchen likely means there are other issues (undercooking, unsafe food storage, etc). First of all the manager wouldn't even come talk to me. And they ultimately only refunded the wings.... I wasted money on food I wouldn't even dare to eat. Not to mention there was a half eaten zinger on the prep counter  overpriced food made in a disgusting kitchen with a negligent staff and a cowardly manager.....",-0.8481
4-Jun-24,"Stopped by for a takeout order because the place we wanted to have dinner was crowded. Two pizzas and an order of wings for $60 - yikes! But this place had such rave reviews we figured it might be worth it. Not! We were told no sodas - ok no problem. Then, no bacon for one of the pizzas - again, no problem. No offer to give a refund or discount though. We brought the food home - we life about a half mile away. If we hadn't seen them cooking the food, I'd have sworn it had been cooked hours ago and kept warm. The wings, supposed to be extra crispy, were not even close. Soggy, lukewarm french fries. And the pizza had no flavor at all - mostly chewy dough, with hardly any sauce or cheese. Very disappointing - will not return.",-0.9725
3-Jun-24,"A food service industry with a lot of 'No' we dont have it . No soda , no burgers , and not enough of this for that order. Like i said they have a lot of 'No' .",0.2933
2-Jun-24,Service was good but the pizza and garlic knots that have been so hyped up were terrible! Pizza was borderline burnt and crust had the flavor of cardboard. The garlic flavor on the knots was strong which I like but they were old stale garlic knots. They're big but absolutely insane to be $8 for 6 old stale garlic knots. I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and we were very disappointed!,-0.6871
19-May-24,"My bf and I stopped here on a road trip. I'm from St. Louis and he is from Sacramento. We saw this place on tik tok. We LOVED the lemon pepper wings. Best wings i've ever tasted. The peach pineapple habanero wings were great as well. The pizza was good. The ranch was good too! 10/10 recommend, but you HAVE to get lemon pepper wings.",0.9003
17-May-24,"Order chicken fingers and fries. Chicken fingers, I think were chicken breast just cut up and deep fried. Tough and not very good at all .  French fries were OK a bit undercooked. Did not come with any dipping sauce such as ranch or blue cheese no celery or carrot as.  There seemed to be boxes and operating items all over.   Not a good vibe if eating inside. I sitting area looked again OK. Seems like they may have been good at one time but most likely not going back.",-0.2849
13-May-24,"Came here bc of Keith Lee. It was so good! We got the 5-0, Italian sub, and of course lemon pepper wings. They were soooo good!! Service was friendly and pretty quick considering they were a bit busy. Definitely will be back!",0.9568
11-May-24,"Went in bc my son saw a TikTok review that went viral. Having owned a family pizza shop when I was younger I'm always up to try out a new pizza spot. We had no idea what we wanted so we tried a bit of everything that looked or sounded good. We liked that they bring your order out as things get made instead of all at once. Gives you time to try multiple things in stages. We enjoyed the Italian Stromboli first. Was soft yet crisp. Perfection in the baking. I'm not a tomato person I I pulled those off. They are thinly sliced and easy to remove. Next time I'll order it without. The wings were delicious. Nice crispiness to them and soaked in just the right amount of sauce. We tried the Frankensons Fire and the Sweet BBQ. Definitely would order again!The zucchini planks left a little to be desired. The batter over took the flavor of everything and just left a doughy taste on your mouth. Probably wouldn't order again. The bacon wrapped jalapeño poppers we wanted were not available so we tried the zucchini bread knots instead and although decent we would probably not order again. Too much bread by comparison. The pizza was good. We tried the buffalo chicken which we would definitely order again. The chicken was Chick-fil-A style. So good! We ordered the white pizza but it had a hint of a seafood taste to it. If you're not into that you may not like this one. My son said he would definitely not order it again. I thought it was okay. Easy to order when you walk in. Find a table, grab your drinks. Get your own plate and plastic silverware and wait for your food to come to you. It was clean and the employees seemed friendly and happy to be there. We will return and would recommend you give it a try.",0.9913
6-May-24,We came here last year because Keith Lee gave great reviews. The pizza was amazing last time. We ordered today amd in addition to the putting the wrong topping on our pizza the bottom was burnt. The quality has went down ridiculously.  The owner also isn't as friendly as he was the last time we where there either. Hopefully they get it together because this was the best pizza and now it's the worst. The seating area always seems to be very warm. We would give 0 stars,0.697
6-May-24,"We were in the area, searched restaurants and this came up. Brought the kids over after playing at the park. Prices are a bit high, for large pizza, tenders, jalapeño poppers and drinks it's was $80+. When we went to sit at the tables inside, there is ants EVERYWHERE!!! You can't even be by a table without them crawling everywhere. We decided to wait and sit outside. After a few complaints someone went to go spray. They're using a chemical that can be purchased at home depot or Lowe's. Roach/Ant/Spider Killer Spray. Chicken Tenders are nasty. They're cut up chicken breasts, not even battered and fried. They're super rough and hard to chewy through. It's gross. It's like chewing on a rubberband. Pizza is mediocre, typical pizzeria. Not the best but not the worst. Garlic Knots are good. Jalapeño Poppers are your typical cream cheese wrapped in bacon. Nothing different or fancy at all. I don't plan on returning. Just not something I could go back to, just sucks because I left wishing I never spent my money here.",0.5695
6-May-24,"The service was great. The owner came around from the back and spoke with my wife and I, he some riddles that we solved and gave us free garlic knots, he made the experience great. Ohh and the food was delicious. Great place to eat and have a chat.",0.9698
5-May-24,Finally made it over to Frankensons! It's located near 215/Windmill. Was hoping it wouldn't be too busy yet since it was still early but we were the only ones there! My daughter for sure wanted to order the garlic knots and we got the 6 price and the girl did say they were big but we stuck with the 6. You get a choice of marinara or pesto dipping sauce and I asked her which one is better and she said liked both and gave us both to try! So we were bummed to find out they don't do pizza by the slice on weekends (boo!) so we got a small pepperoni instead. There is a dining area in the back. There are TVs as well. She told us it would be about 15 min and she brought our order to us. The garlic knots are definitely big! They were piping hot! It comes topped with fresh garlic and butter. It is very soft inside and really good! We tried both dipping sauces and my personal favorite was the pesto. The small pizza came with 8 slices. It was good but nothing special. I would want to try some of their other flavors which is why we were bummed about the slices. Next time!,0.9843
3-May-24,"Walked in last night for the 1st time.  The gentleman at the counter answered all my questions so I ordered my pizzas and waited.  The place is clean, good menu, very friendly service.  The pizza was delicious!!!!  Pricing is not bad either.  Compared to most of the pizza places I go to!  I'm not sure if this is a limited time special I was told Tuesday and Thursday are 2 for 1.  Absolutely love the fact they are close.  The only downfall is they don't have delivery, are not on Uber eats or door dash yet.  Hopefully soon.  Thanks for a wonderful dinner",0.9793
30-Apr-24,"I ordered the chicken tenders with fries a couple weeks ago and they were terrible. I should have took a picture because they were so unappetizing in appearance. They aren't like a normal chicken tender. It's like they took a breast and cut it into strips and there was no breading, they were thick, deep fried and threw some sauce on them. They resembled french toast sticks. They were like leather because of being fried without skin on. I choked down one but they were so unappetizing I couldn't eat more. The ranch is horrible. It tastes like ranch and blue cheese mixed up and I hate blue cheese. Just go buy some chicken fingers and hidden valley ranch... not returning.",-0.9535
23-Apr-24,I had the pepperoni pizza and peach jalapeño wings. The pizza was average. The wings were not great. Hardly any peach flavor and the jalapeño tastes like grass clippings. The breading on the wings were soggy. Definitely not worth the money. The review from Keith Lee was from a year ago and did not look like what we had. Apparently they had hardly any customers before he reviewed them on TikTok and saved the business. There was probably a reason for that. You should not have to depend on an influencer to get customers.,0.6747
15-Apr-24,It's so good! Every time! Consistently great every time! I love their chicken wings and the toasted Italian. Those are my faves. Pizzas super good too. Garlic knots have a ton of garlic. Be warned! Great family pizzeria,0.9743
6-Apr-24,"Pizza crust was light and crispy. Garlic knots were bigger than my fist and loaded with fresh, buttery garlic. The knots themselves were pillowy balls of dough on the inside and a firm sourdough-like crust on the outside. Very delicious and worth the trip. Will go again the next time I'm in Vegas.",0.8155
6-Apr-24,"I waited until the viral video wore off to visit, the bar was set really high after Keith Lee came in and it did not stand the test of time. We walked into a place full of staff that didn't bother to look up or greet us. (Noticed a girl had AirPods in, really annoyed me for some reason). We ordered a ham & cheese calzone, portobello burger, a kids spaghetti and meatballs and 6 garlic knots and a vanilla milkshake. After ordering we walked into a very messy (and dare I say dirty) sitting area with trash overflowing from the can that's placed right next to the lids for the cups -which did get switched out sometime while we waited for our food- The garlic knots were just ok, soft bread, a little too much rosemary. We asked for pesto but were informed they had none, so we took the marinara which came cold from the fridge. Maybe it would have been decent hot. We'll never know. The calzone is a very generous portion, but again, I was expecting something amazing and it was just meh. The portobello burger had just regular sautéed mushrooms in some kind of weird sauce (teriyaki?) which made the lettuce look old and wilted. I did not want to try it just based off looks.The spaghetti was... nothing to write home about. Same sauce as the garlic knots just cold. Overall it was a disappointing experience. We spent about 60 dollars and left to go eat elsewhere.  Lesson learned about viral videos. Will not try again.",0.5334
3-Apr-24,"Based on the past reviews, this might have been an off day, but my rating is based on my experience. Keith Lee got this place a lot of hype, but it's meh. Kid at the counter barely said hello, was definitely not friendly, had his AirPod in the whole time, and was just not looking happy to be there. Neither were the two girls behind the line. One of my pet peeves is people who choose to work in customer service with a bad attitude. I don't take it personally, but it's a bad look - especially when there's hundreds of other options in the city for the style of food you're serving.Wings were a good size, and come with small serving of fries and one sauce, 12.99 for a dozen which is fair, crust on pizza was good, and it tasted good, but not $40 good. Total for a 20"" pizza and 12 wings was an outrageous $58 total. $2.50 per topping on a pizza pie, and we only had 3 toppings.Lastly, the dining room/storage area was a very warm and it's only April. I say storage because there were boxes stacked up sloppily in plain view and it's just not a good look - again.Quality food. Horrible service. Uncomfortable atmosphere.I'd order wings again to go, and probably a slice, but I'm not rushing back. Best of luck to owner.",-0.5501
1-Apr-24,"I ordered the pesto pasta with chicken. It was horrible. It was drenched in pesto. Looks like a leprechaun threw up all over the dish. It was not good at all. It took over an hour to be served our food. Not many people in the restaurant but they were receiving lots of calls. The place is jam packed with boxes, soda crates, extra supplies. It's not clean and very cluttered. Check the expiration on the sodas. My daughter got an expired one out of the fridge. The reason for two stars is the cashier was extremely friendly. Their calzone was very good. Do not get the marinara or the pesto sauce for dipping sauces!!!! It's disgusting. It tastes like pure tomato paste and oily. We will not be back because there were more negative points than good. We really wish we could support local but this place needs a lot of work.",-0.7927
31-Mar-24,"Came due to the Keith Lee TikTok review.  I was skeptical on how good it could be.  I called in due to coming in with a large party of 17 on a holiday weekend.  Not sure if Frank was the one that answered, but customer service was ON POINT.  Super friendly and warm.  When we got there, the service was just great.  Frank came over asking where we were from and thanked us for dining with them.  Food was as amazing as Keith Lee said.  Pepperoni pizza was a 10.  Wings were a 10.  Garlic knots were packed with favor and huge!!  Kids said the spaghetti and meatballs were really good.  Kids loved the food, parents loved the food.  We will definitely come back every time we're in town.",0.9958
30-Mar-24,"The food was amazing, It does have limited seating but the environment was amazing and the service was really good. The staff came by and talked to us for a while. We ordered more but I didn't get a picture of it.",0.9089
30-Mar-24,The food was great we ordered so much a little bit of everything. I love the stuff jalapeños.  pasta salad was good but we ordered all kind of stuff for nine people,0.7269
30-Mar-24,The people who work there are great the knots and white pizzas are really good. The other stuff is good for Las Vegas. The wings aren't a 10 out of  10 there is nothing special about them they are good but to say they are the best is a far stretch. but overall on a national scale it's ok I would eat again next time I'm in the area. Oh I never give a 5 start unless you blow my mind.,0.9414

28-Mar-24,"I am very disappointed in their service tonight. I called to order a Philly cheesesteak sub, and some wings. The sub was the FIRST item I ordered. I was then ordering the wings and he interrupted me and said, can you hold on for a second... He then came back to take my order for the wings. I went to pick up my food and assumed everything was good... Got home and no Sub. I called to complain, and apparently he never rang it up. Obviously, he was too distracted by whatever was going on in the background when he took the order for the wings and forgot to ring up the sub. What do I get for this? ""Sorry for the inconvenience. We will make it but you have to pay for it and come pick it up."" PI$$ POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. You just lost my business and I was a pretty regular customer.",-0.9059

21-Mar-24,Finally was able to make it back to the restaurant after going viral. Holy... did the prices go up.  Looks like I'll need to find a new hole in the wall.Now that there aren't any lines out  the door... maybe come back to reality with the prices.,0.3612
18-Mar-24,Waited a long time to come here and everything was great ! I miss the days when the owner comes up to you and asks how you're doing and thanks you for coming .....it was great Frank !,0.9018
18-Mar-24,"Pretty good but also kinda pricey. We got a medium pizza, six chicken tenders, and small cheesesteak fries. It was like $65 after the tip. Pizza was good, not super greasy, not falling apart when you pick it up. Toppings stayed put. Crust was delicious. Tenders were interesting but good. Fries had a delicious seasoning. It's clear they make their own sauces. We tried sweet bbq, mango pineapple something, and ranch. Bbq tasted like it was ketchup-based. The mango one was a weird consistency, almost like watery applesauce, and very sweet. Ranch was super good. Cheesesteak fries were the least impressive, there were quite a few bites of meat we had to spit out because they were all fat.",0.9911
18-Mar-24,"We had to try this place out, after coming across it on Yelp and seeing the food pics.  We hadn't previously heard anything about the influencer who apparently put them on the map.  Since they are not that far from where we live, we couldn't believe we had never been there before.    We couldn't even get them to answer the phone, so my husband would stop by after work, and he'd see a huge line outside and try another day.  We waited about a month before finally trying again.  It still took at least an hour after ordering before we got our food to go.  We ordered garlic knots, lemon pepper wings, and some type of Italian sandwich.      How in the world could Everything be bad?!  The food was bland and tasteless.  The wings were that fatty texture that makes you wonder what they plumped up the chicken with, and the sauce that covered them was just gross.  Garlic knots were tried and thrown out with the wings.  The sandwich rated a 7 out of 10, which is like a C grade.    Do ""Knot"" Believe The Hype.  We won't be going back again.  (How do you know when an inflencer is lying? There lips are moving.)",-0.6759
17-Mar-24,"Short reviewPlace is just okay. Customer service is good, wings are great and pizza is meh. I ordered a basic pepperoni pizza and it was odd. I was a bit confused because how can you make such a meh pepperoni pizza. It was the elephant in the room with the other people who were with me who ate the pizza. We ordered a few other pizzas but forgettable.  Wings were great. Give those a try, nothing like them",0.7457
14-Mar-24,"I feel like I mightve gone on an off day, I was looking forward to trying these wings ( pinaple habanero / peach chutney) but it felt like the wings barely had any flavor kinda like if the wing sauce was watered down. on a positive note the French fries were pretty good, the homemade ranch sauce was amazing and I really  enjoyed the carrot sticks. I'm hoping it was just an off day on the wings . next time I'm in Vegas I would love to give it another try.",0.9922
12-Mar-24,"Great pizza. Phenomenal service. Recalled my name throughout the visit. This place was everything it was hyped up to be. I requested a garlic butter dipping sauce which they didn't have but they made one special for me. Stop considering other pizza places and come here, you've found the one",0.5106
5-Mar-24,"Amazing food but even better service, was able to talk to frank and even gave us a wedding present, the italian sub is definitely my personal favorite",0.93
4-Mar-24,"First things first the lemon pepper wings and the garlic nots were phenomenal! The lemon pepper wings were my absolute favorite it was a burst of flavor in my mouth, I also loved the homemade ranch. The owner frank was so sweet, he is a great guy, had great costumer service and hospitality, I really enjoyed his riddles! The Italian sub was also THE BOMB, Overall I really recommend eating at frankensons, I will definitely be coming back!",0.9776
4-Mar-24,"Frank was here when we arrived and he was an absolute joy. He sat with us as we ate, gave us riddles, and free food! He's truly a gem. If I was local I would frequent this business more! I will definitely be here whenever I'm in town.",0.9269
4-Mar-24,"Frank is one of the coolest dudes I've ever met. This man knows how to treat his customers, and his riddles are hilarious! The Italian Sub is a must, and garlic knots are amazing. I will be coming back to visit every time we are back in Vegas. Thanks Frank my family enjoyed your hospitality.",0.9402
4-Mar-24,"I was in Vegas for a quick 2 days for meetings and saw a video from Keith regarding this place. First and foremost, Frank makes this place what it is. It's a level of comfort food that anyone can enjoy and fall in love with. Although I only tried 2 items, the service was great. The environment was just a cool. The wings are amazing and packed with flavor. The lemon pepper was to die for.  It was crispy and juicy. I would add, the fries were ok I would twice fry them. Or try the crinkle fry tossed with garlic salt with a touch of sugar. The white pizza was awesome. The cheese and sauce made it, very garlicky. I added red pepper flakes for a little kick. The crust was crispy and had no flop. One Bite! I recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas and who ever is passing through. Support the locals and support the mom and pops who are putting their heart and soul into their craft. The passion shows through their food, Keith certainly deserves everyone's support.",0.9863
1-Mar-24,"Drove all the way from Los Angeles to try this place and I was not disappointed! The wings are straight fire, made with love!! The owner Frank is a sweetheart, and the staff were really really nice, a definite must try!",0.9567
1-Mar-24,"DUDE!!!! So I'm one of those picky customers who rarely gives a restaurant a 5. My boyfriend and I shared a 12 wing combo. I saw Keith Lee's review on the lemon pepper wings so I had to try them. I literally said, ""Wow!"" when I opened the box. These wings are huge and juicy! It truly tastes homemade and the best I've ever had. The ranch was homemade too (and I'm super picky about my ranch). The fries are just fries, nothing in comparison to the wings. The employees were extremely kind. The wait is a little long, but it's well worth it. The dining room is very casual and a family atmosphere. I personally don't like TV's when I dine, but I sat farther away. I was sure to tell the employee working that they were the best. He was grateful!",0.9828
25-Feb-24,This is a small shop almost hidden away. There is a rack for travel luggage if you are traveling from out of state. Since I cannot eat dairy I have ordered the Italian sub without cheese and they were happy to make that accommodation. There was an issue one time where they forgot to take the cheese off. They were able to offer me another sandwich in order to make up for that mistake. The customer service here has been great. The sandwich itself is very tasty. I will say the amount of vinaigrette on the sandwich has changed each time. Aside from that it's pretty consistent. I would def recommend coming down to try out their food.,0.9022
24-Feb-24,"My boyfriend stopped by Frankensons on Friday after 10pm. He saw that online it states they close at 11. When he got there he realized they were closed and ran into Mr.Frank who apologized as their hours had changed. They had a nice conversation and my boyfriend promised to be back this weekend, especially since Frank recommended he try the Italian sub. We stopped by today and tried the sub and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. Frank and his staff have wonderful customer service. We've been there a few times and we've never had anything to complain about. This place, staff and food are wonderful! Highly recommend!",0.9603
23-Feb-24,"Closes early so don't trust their hours posted. This place is empty on a Friday night, prompting the closing early I guess? Sucks when you decide to drive there and even call first, to only get there 15 min after you call to see him locking doors and lights off.",-0.7415
22-Feb-24,"This place has great pizza & wings but I tried the meatball sub last night and it was really good.  Go see Frank and fam, his place is doing great things with food.",0.9259
21-Feb-24,"The service was amazing. The wing flavors that I had was the peach habanero along with the lemon pepper. My wings were very flavorful. I also ordered three garlic knots. The portions were very significant. I only finish half of my wings. I would definitely recommend the management was very personable, and evenprovided me with some complementary waters to take with me to go. I definitely recommend this restaurant.",0.9359
19-Feb-24,Drove all the way from California. My son was so excited to come here. Delicious food and helpful people.,0.863
19-Feb-24,"My 2nd time here, I wanted to stop for their Meatball sandwich as it tastes great. My buddy got a Calzone that was massive and tasty. Just like our 1st visit, Frank and his staff were very friendly and helpful. As we were waiting for our food, Frank asked us what we were doing for food for our SuperBowl party as he said he has a special for 50 wings and 2 pizzas. We decided to order from him and picked it up on Sunday and it was ready at 1pm. Everyone loved the food. Thank you Frank for always being so gracious. We will be back",0.9832
17-Feb-24,Came here off a Keith Lee recommendation. The lemon pepper chicken is legit. It's really tangy and I vouch for it.,0.0
16-Feb-24,"Absolutely amazing!!! Just as Keith lee said, great food, great owner and great staff!!! We loved everything we had and got a chance to speak with the owner! Will be back for the sub!",0.9763
15-Feb-24,"Now I like garlic and I loved how I can taste the garlic in these dishes. Taste wise it is better than most pizzas in town. Everything was very delicious, fresh and served hot. Frankensons is a must place to go. Even Frank recommends the sub and calzone. We got a lot for the first time and will be back for more of the menu and the ""monsterous"" sizes!",0.9646
13-Feb-24,"First time trying this place. Called and placed an order for pick-up. Spoke to Frank on the phone, and he was super nice and patient. The food was ready in about 30ish minutes. Frank was just as nice in person as he was on the phone. Customer service 10 out of 10 for sure! The garlic knots were huge, and sooooo good!!! They were my favorite item. We tried the peach habanero and lemon pepper wings. The flavors were ok but will probably stick to the classic buffalo next time. The fries that came with the wings are really, really good, too! Great flavor and nice crunch. For the pizza, we ordered a pepperoni, onion, and green pepper.  It was ok, but it seemed a touch dry. Maybe not enough sauce? Definitely will be back to try other items on the menu, like the Italian sub and stromboli!",0.9846
12-Feb-24,"I tried this place because of Keith Lee. This place is amazing! Frank, the owner, was amazing as well! If you come to Vegas make sure to give this place a go! It was well worth it!",0.9448
12-Feb-24,It's Super Bowl Sunday and I was pretty excited to come try this place cuz of Keith Lee. We came from Atlanta and I'm a foodie so this is one of the places I wanted to try out while we're out here and I wanted to wait till all the hype died down. We came in after halftime to order some food. There were only 2 other ppl sitting down to eat so it was basically dead. The cashier was very nice. The order took about 25-30 minutes but we knew it was made to order so we weren't upset about it at all. We ordered the Italian Stromboli and lemon pepper wings. The Stromboli was hot and fresh but a little too salty but that could be from the meat inside. The wings weren't crispy and didn't have enough lemon pepper taste to it. The fries were hot and crispy so I'm not sure if they cooked the wings first or what. There weren't any carrots or celery that came with it. Overall it wasn't bad for me but it could've been better on the wings part because we were expecting to get crispy lemon pepper wings considering we waited almost 30 minute for them. They were good sized chicken wings but lacked a little seasoning and crispiness. We spent $34 so that's not bad for Vegas. It's not close to the strips at all. Maybe it would've been better if Frank was there but we understand you can't be there all the time,0.977
10-Feb-24,"Decided to try this place based on the TikTok we saw, I was not impressed. The pizza was pretty good, we had the medium meat lovers, it was a big portion, a small would've been enough for two people. The wings, however, were not the best. I ordered the peach/pineapple/habanero and lemon pepper flavors, they were so bland! I had to add salt to the habanero wings. We also had asked for ranch but it tasted like ranch mixed with blue cheese, at this point I was already disappointed so I didn't want to ask if it WAS ranch. There is a seating area but there were stacks of boxes along the wall. The staff was great. The leftovers went to waste. I wouldn't return anytime soon.",0.4368
8-Feb-24,"This place is great! Everyone was so nice and friendly, including the owner frank. He really was a nice and humbling guy, and you can tell he really cares for his food and staff. The place was bigger than it looked in photos and from the outside view. The menu options were great they offer everything from pizza to burgers and everything in between. We got the medium pizza, half pepperoni and sausage, and half battered chicken with peppers, garlic knots, ranch, and 2 drinks. First, the pizza was amazing. The crust was soft and buttery. The ingredients were spot on and tasted fresh. I would rate it a 9.7 / 10. The garlic knots were really good and massive! You get 4, they make the bread 3 days in advance, and it is so soft and rips apart really nice. The owner Frank gave us some cheese to go with them. I would give the garlic knots a 9.5, but the cheese sauce probably would skip next time it was okay 4/10. I would also like to mention their in-house ranch they made. I like ranch, but theirs was amazing, so flavorful you can taste everything they put in it. I would give it a 9/10. Overall, our experience was amazing. The staff was great, Frank was very nice and friendly, and the food was just phenomenal. Overall, I would give it a 9.7. I will be going back for sure and even look to see if they offer a party package.",0.9962
8-Feb-24,"Good customer service. I don't complaints about that. Everybody at the front on who was serving as well as the people in the back cooking were super duper nice and The prices are reasonable.It doesn't look like it's on the menu but you can order individual slices in the toppings are only $0.40 moreIf you are in the building the fountain drinks are free. This is pretty clutch because everywhere else is going to charge you at least $1.50 or $2 to get a drink out of the fountain, let alone how much they would charge you to grab a bottle of something. But this made it kind of worth sitting inside.It's a decent size space and it has about room for almost 40 people or so. When you look at it initially all you see is the part where they're taking orders are making food but you have to walk around to the area where the TV is to get your seating. It doesn't look like it holds that many people but it holds a nice amount. But I could understand that this spot was more of a carry out spot. It has TV so you can actually watch TV if they have something on You can definitely watch. It's not like a sports bar so don't get it twisted that there is a number of TVs there as in if you would if you went to a Chili's or a Fridays or something, this is not that. But if you just trying to catch some highlight clips, while you're eating your pizza, you could do that here.It is actually pretty clean so you don't mind eating there because it's very well kept. I mean I guess we should all be serious about what we're eating and where we're eating it at the end of the day. You're trying to serve me food and all I see is grime around? Who's going to want to do that? This place was super clean and the bathroom was just the same. It look like they had cleaned it recently so that was actually nice to see.I try to slice a pizza and a peach mango having their own wings and the garlic knotsSo I tried a few things. I tried to peach and mango habanero wings. They were good. They didn't have as much kick or spice to them as I would have like but they were sweet so if you like a sweet and tangy kind of undertone with your wings this is definitely your choice, to me. The wings are also pretty big and meaty so it wasn't like they gave you tiny finger bones, they gave you big hearty wings.I tried some pizza. Not a pizza was just okay. It came loaded with toppings and I was good, but the pizza was only all right, would I get it again, yes. If I wanted a slice then sure. But it wasn't breaking the bank when it came to the pizza but it was definitely something decent that you could dabble on and it was a decent size so it would fill you up.Now let me tell you, the garlic knots were a problem! We got six of them and we didn't finish those. One of those joints was enough to go ahead and make you feel full. They were huge and had fresh garlic all over them. They had the dipping sauce with them, that gave it that extra marinara kick, they were clutch and they were the star of the table I think. If you're by yourself, you don't need that many at all. One or two would be fine, especially if you have other food at the table. They put their love into those garlic joints!Overall it was a good experience. I would go back if I was going to be in Vegas again.",0.9979
6-Feb-24,"Of course, word of mouth introduced me to this restaurant. The service from the staff was good but the hospitality from the owner Mr. Frank himself was very unexpected. It seems that he likes to great each patron personally. He even offers conversation and complimentary refreshments. The food was very good, so far the white pizza with tomatoes, Italian sub and garlic knots are my favorites. I'll be back soon.",0.9741
6-Feb-24,My sister and I went to pick up two pizzas and let me tell you!! DELICIOUS!  My sister went in to pay and get the pizzas and she said they were so nice to her!  She spoke with the owner Frank and he was kind and genuinely interested in what she was saying!,0.9425
4-Feb-24,Awesome service and deliciousness. Plus the pizza is Big! We had the sausage and pepperoni and it definitely had a homemade taste.,0.8718
4-Feb-24,"This review is a few months late but we came here for the hot Italian sandwich. Holy moly, it's packed with cured meats, Italian dressing, and it was hot and delicious. The service was awesome, Frank himself was telling us a few jokes and it's just an easy place to get take out or sit and have a good hot sandwich, pizza, wings, or some garlic knots. I always get an Italian sandwich if an establishment has one and this one lives up to the hype. Love to support a small, family owned business. We live in Southern California and we've already been back one other time before posting this review- brought my sister and brother-in-law (Vegas locals) along and they both loved it as well. Looking forward to eating here again.",0.9913
30-Jan-24,"First time coming to Frankansons, and they did not disappoint. The food is tasty we ordered jalapeño garlic knots, lemon pepper wings, Italian cold sub, and peperoni and sausage pizza. I'll start with the jalapeño garlic knots they are so cheesy they used fresh jalapeños on top so tasty and delicious came with a side of marinara sauce for dipping. Their lemon pepper wing seemed to have been soaked in lemon juice, and red pepper flakes not your typical tossed around in lemon pepper seasoning I was very pleasantly surprised very lemony and a hint of spice from the red pepper flakes delicious. Next the Italian sub we ordered it cold (it comes cold or hot)It was very delicious. The Italian dressing that he puts on the sub is phenomenal, the best I've had and I love Italian subs. The pizza is delicious also I love that the sausage was ground to it was in every bite....yum. The owner himself came out and brought us our food he is very personable gave suggestions telling jokes to us, and other customers. He told us we should have order the regular garlic knots, and ordered the Italian sub toasted next time, also told us he had a great salted caramel with pretzel milkshake I told him next time we come I'll have to try it because it's my favorite. And what do you know he made me one (salted caramel pretzel milkshake!!!!) let me tell you it made my day it was so Cameli the pretzels we ground so good. He also asked the young men at another table to solve a riddle and if they got it right he'd give them a free salted caramel pretzel milkshake as well.",0.9959
25-Jan-24,"We stopped by as we were on our way home due to my coworker asking if we can stop by and pick up some food, specifically the garlic knots and peach chutney wings along with an order of the cheese Jalapeño knots. The wait time for our food was a little long about 25 minutes, but you can't rush good food. We ended up talking to one of the employees and he showed great appreciation that we showed and to support there business. We ended up not getting into any of the food until later in the day other than the fries which we ate right away. The fries were cooked perfectly and topped with both salt and pepper which didn't overwhelm the fries, but added the right amount of flavor. My favorite item was the cheese Jalapeño knots now those things were 10/10 and paired with there made from scratch in house ranch easily 100/10. This is a must try spot to visit in vegas. We will be returning when we are back in vegas for EDC in the spring time.",0.978

16-Jan-24,"First I wanna start off with the owner was one of the nicest people!! Our first time here I went with my twin brother who is visiting from Japan from being in the Marines, and I believe the owner is doing a trivia with another family as soon as we walk in for free garlic knots we do the trivia with the other family and received a free order of garlic knots as soon as we walked in!!! Absolutely fun and awesome. The vibe seemed absolutely great. The ambience was perfect. Everyone was super nice, super friendly, and even helped out with explaining the menu. Like I said, being the first time we ordered a lot. So the wait time was around 30+ minutes. We had garlic, Parmesan wings, the pineapple habanero wings, zesty, barbecue wings and then I can't remember the last they were all very good if you get the garlic knots it's no use in getting the garlic wings just too much garlic. The garlic knots are really good. They were more like garlic balls, they were huge but great and crispy and in the inside they were fully cooked. That's what I was worried about for them being so big, but was satisfied!! Like I said, I believe the owner he kept playing trivia games with the rest of the families inside of restaurant at the time, either another garlic knot or free shakes, which again was very cool and very nice!!!! 10/10 would come again. the pizza was huge but cooked perfectly not the best pizza in the world but something to try and worthwhile! Prices weren't crazy either!! Hopefully they make it!",0.9953
14-Jan-24,The absolute worst customer service we have ever experienced.   Witnessed several people walking out due to rudness.   The owner himself needs to get out of the public business.   He has no customer service skills what so ever.   ever.  Doesn't even deserve one star.,-0.743
6-Jan-24,Excellent mini pizza.  Crust perfect. Sauce just spicy enough.  Could use few more mushrooms.  Can't stop eating. Thx Keith Lee. Great service.,0.9108
5-Jan-24,"Long wait times and extremely bad customer service. We patienly waited, after 50 min for fries, just that. We decided to check on our order, to find it was just sitting there, forgotten about. Instead of apologizing, the manager made up excuses. He and his employees never apologized or even bothered to thank us, even as they handed over the food.  I tried to let them redeem themselves by saying to the manager that a simple apology for missing our order or even a thank you, would go a long way and make it better, but he didn't say either. Instead, he made up a lie and said we snatched the bag from his worker, which we did NOT, in fact, just the opposite, we held the bag in the air for a second or two, waiting for a thank you, which never came. Plus, the manager was looking down at orders so he didn't even see us get the bag. So, in addition to bad service and long wait times, the manager lied and made false accusations too. We try to support small business, but we're NEVER going back to this place, ever again!!",-0.8177
5-Jan-24,"I came here with my family Friday evening in January & the experience was nothing short of amazing. We ordered about 90 dollars worth of food and every dollar was worth it. The pizza was AMAZING. Fresh, hot, and delicious. My husband loved his Philly cheesesteak. We also ordered the garlic Parmesan chicken tenders which were delicious with the ranch; I couldn't get enough of them. So flavorful and juicy and tender. We also got an order of garlic knots and a salted caramel pretzel milkshake which was given to us from Frank , the owner, in exchange for answering some riddles (lol) the owner was so incredibly sweet and just generous. Customer service was 1000/10. He was very interactive with us and the other group of customers in the dining area and kept coming back to check on us to make sure we were enjoying our time. Side note--the restaurant was clean and spacious. It was a bit hot in the dining area so if that bothers you I would go when the sun isn't setting which in January is around 3-4 which is the time we showed up. But I would go again and again. We're in town for a trip to Vegas this week and me and my husband want to come back again tomorrow (and we will) the menu is extensive, sooo many options to choose from. If you can take anything away from my review/ personal experience is if you're thinking about going you need to just go. Of all the places I've heard about through social media and marketing, this restaurant has been my favorite and the best customer service experience I've had and that was all thanks to Frank. He really puts his heart into making sure you enjoy yourself as well as your food. Staff was also great! Helpful and nice and welcoming. I WILL be back. Every time I come to Vegas now I want to come here & I will. Please please try it out. You won't regret it",0.9969
5-Jan-24,"Our DIL heard about Frankensons pizza, so we decided to try on our recent trip to Vegas. We were greeted by Frank himself with a big smile and warm greeting. We got the meat lovers pizza,  garlic knots, and topped it off with a salted caramel pretzel shake. All I can say is YUM!! The food was made fresh and came out hot. The meat lovers had lots of meat with just enough of a spicy kick. The garlic knots were a perfect pastry - both crispy and tender. My My husband loved the shake too! Will definitely be a repeat customer!",0.9783
4-Jan-24,"Had the pizza for an office party. Came to pick it up and Frank said ""Hey is this for an office?"" I said yes, he then told me to grab some 2-liters on the house. The pizza is good and the slices are HUGE!  Amazing customer service and an owner who takes pride in his business.",0.9503
4-Jan-24,"Between the food and the overall experience, If I could give this place more than 5 stars I would. The peach pineapple habanero wings were absolutely delicious and the ranch is homemade!The garlic knots and Jalapeño poppers were off the chain. The pepperoni and sausage calzone was humongous and was 10/10. We also got to meet the owner Frank who was kind, giving and made the trip to Las Vegas an amazing experience had given my wife and I a salted pretzel caramel milkshake in exchange for a riddle that my wife solved. Yes it was phenomenal. When my wife and I travel to Las Vegas, Frankensons will always be a must stop.Thank you frank for the great food and amazing hospitality.",0.979
4-Jan-24,"Let me just say... WOW!! Like most people here I saw it on tik tok months ago so when we came to Vegas I knew we had to stop... and we will be back! The food was AMAZING!! Enormous portions, cooked fresh and served hot, and extremely tasty! The Peach pineapple habanero wings were absolutely phenomenal. Now the customer service was out of this world!! From the moment we walked in we were greeted and upon seating the owner Frank came to each table to check on everything and we had an entire conversation it felt like we were talking to an old friend. He even threw in some freebies for us which we can't thank him enough. We will be back!! I hope everyone who sees this gives Franksnsons a try and enjoys it as much as we did!",0.983
4-Jan-24,"We were in town from Phoenix and we knew the hype from Keith Lee's review... IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE! This food is AMAZING. The pepperoni on the pizza ""cups"" when cooked. The cheese has a good cheese flavor. Portions are huge. The spaghetti and meatballs are delicious. The meatballs don't have that weird consistency like some places. The marinara sauce is superb! It tastes like fresh crushed tomatoes. None of that ""canned flavor"" to be found. And we got to meet Frank. Super nice guy. He cares about his food and his customers and it shows. I told him he needs to come to Phoenix because I am addicted and Vegas is too far for me!",0.9863
3-Jan-24,"The best service I have ever had at any restaurant. This is my first yelp review, I had to say something because it was hands down amazing. Frank the owner was there and all of the staff was there too, they greeted us with kindness. After we ordered we sat down and the owner sparked a conversation, asked us riddles and when we guessed right he gave us zucchini planks, and two shakes on the house. As an introverted individual they did not make me feel uncomfortable or anxious. Very kind people. All of this only adds to the amazing food. The garlic knots tasted amazing, and had real garlic. The zucchini planks were fresh and the breading wasn't too heavy. The wings were perfect even after driving 25 minutes back to our hotel. 10/10 food and service. I will be coming back every time I visit Vegas!!!",0.9812
3-Jan-24,"Drove 25 minutes home to try the wings and somehow they were still PERFECTION! Hands down, the best wings, zucchini plank, and garlic knots I've EVER had. What are the odds you'd find it all in one spot?! I've never had garlic knots like this before, the garlic was so fresh and plentiful with a perfect amount, coming out steaming fresh. Not only do they have exceptional food but the service is outstanding. All food is made fresh to order and the owner made sure to engage with us while we waited for food. He kindly gave us AMAZING salted caramel milkshakes and zucchini plank on the house, it's one thing to have good service or good food but Frankensons has it all in one place. Paid $26 for 12 wings & 3 garlic knots, can't get anything like that anywhere else for the quality and price. Thank you Frank for sharing your passion with us foodies!",0.9962
2-Jan-24,"5 stars for the best wings I have ever had. Listen, I like my wings a certain way that I am always disappointed when I eat them in restaurants because they are too crunchy and the meat is dry, etc. Not these bad boys! The lemon pepper wings were so juicy and packed with flavor that I did the eye roll/flutter, lol. Amazing! The fire sauce was perfect. Great spice and flavor, so good. The French fries were on point. Personally I like soggy fries but these were not; they were crunchy and you could still taste some potato meat in there. Good combination. My husband also had a hot Italian sub and he said it was seasoned and juicy. It disappeared before I ever took a photo so I imagine it was very good.I ordered the spinach artichoke pizza and I wish there were a bit more garlic on top or in the sauce because it was a little bland to me but the crust is top notch.The service was friendly and helpful. They made recommendations and were wiping down tables; hand delivering the food to people. The eating area is spacious and there is a television for your viewing pleasure. Oh and free soft drinks! We will definitely return here when in Vegas. Frankensons is worth the excursion from the strip!",0.995
2-Jan-24,"Margarita Pizza is fire, The Wings are literally huge and flavorful!! and the service was awesome! MUST GO FOR PINAPPLE JALAPENO WINGS. only thing is I didn't see frank maybe next time!",0.7326
1-Jan-24,"My wife and I were excited to try this place after seeing a video on social media. Unfortunately we were disappointed. The cheese slid off the pizza, the wings were soggy, and everything was lacking all around flavor. I also asked for extra ranch and just received two ranches for a whole pizza and large order of wings.",-0.4767
29-Dec-23,"It started off with the phone call, employee's don't know the price and unfamiliar with menu. I was given no price over the phone and didn't take my name. Really friendly owner but the staff were not. Pizza and wings were meh. Nothing out of the ordinary. The owner was the only positive thing about the experience, but even that wasn't enough",0.7267
29-Dec-23,"We came here because our daughter begged us to grab garlic knots and bring them back to Hawaii; she saw a review by Keith Lee and wanted to try them. The place opened promptly at 9:00am and the customer service was excellent! The counter person unlocked the door and held it open for us, and then proceeded to walk over to the register to take our order. Although we were there to get the garlic knots, we also decided to try their pizza and classic chicken sandwich. The garlic knots came with marinara sauce and another sauce that tasted similar to dill Greek dip.. that was so delicious! The garlic knots itself were really huge! It's like triple the size of a regular garlic knot back home! The garlic knot was still steaming, topped with garlic, butter, chili flakes, and parsley... it was absolutely delicious! The pizza was thin, crispy, cheesy and filled with pepperoni. The flavor was definitely on point. The chicken sandwich came with two chicken strips on two toasted buns and it literally covered the entire bottom bun. The chicken were seasoned well and came with lettuce, tomatoes and that delicious dill sauce which resembled a Greek sauce. The fries that came with the sandwich were also seasoned well and were perfectly crispy. I'll definitely come back for those garlic knots when I return to Las Vegas..",0.99
27-Dec-23,We stopped in here after seeing a viral YouTube video. The place was really good but not to the point of driving out of my way to visit.,0.1646
25-Dec-23,"Really overrated. Expensive food for average quality and taste. Pizza is super greasy, tastes fine but nothing worth going back for. Let me buy a drink despite the soft drink machine being broken on 80% of the flavors (There were only like 2-3 flavors working). We had to grab a bottled soft drink from the fridges instead. These drinks shamed aged and not fresh since the fizz of the soda was nonexistent and tasted flat. Boxes stacked everywhere in the dining area, makes the place feel a little crowded and soiled. Overall, if you saw it cause of the hype, it may be considering checking out, but definitely not a place you'd revisit.",-0.5916
24-Dec-23,"I was invited to meet people at Frankensons a few days ago. Now, I had no clue they were TikTok famous until after the fact but let me tell you the food was incredible. They accommodated a group of 16 people and Frank the owner came out to visit with us and make sure we had a stellar experience. He is very generous with the portion sizes. I had the Ham and Cheese Calzone. I have never seen a bigger Calzone in my life. I was able to have extra food for several days. Frank, keep up the good work!",0.9078
23-Dec-23,"We stopped here on our way to Vegas after adding to our food bucket list from tiktok. It's DELICIOUS. There was a little bit of a wait for the food- but the food was so good that we didn't care. We had a hot Italian sandwhich, wings, and the garlic knots. 10/10 for everything. Even the fries were crispy and delicious. It's a nice and chill little place, we will def visit again if we are in the area.",0.9285
22-Dec-23,Overall The food wait was a while Even though it popular as said and not a ling line but people in front food wait was long. Food looks rushed like the wings were sitting in grease undrained. Waited for wings and were not hot when received.Food was at best nothing to crave over but alright,0.9253
22-Dec-23,Great service.... Frank was friendly and really fun with my kids. Pizza and wings were great! Will come back next time we are in town!,0.9483
20-Dec-23,"After seeing Frankensons went viral on TikTok, we couldn't resist giving it a try--and I'm pleased to say, it lived up to the hype. The food was genuinely tasty, delivering on flavor and value for money. While the service did lean on the slower side, the quality of the dishes made the wait worthwhile. As for the ambiance, it's relaxed and casual inside, setting the stage for a laid-back dining experience. All in all, if you're in the mood for some flavorful eats that have been making waves online, Frankensons is worth a visit.",0.8901
19-Dec-23,"I tried this place, because it was all over tik tok with people doing food reviews on it. I had the wings and they were very good! They were good size, they were crispy, and well cooked. I also ordered a pepperoni pizza. It was also very good, I liked the crust a lot. I look forward to coming back and trying one of the sandwiches that were also highly rated.",0.9331
17-Dec-23,"Even though the food is decent, the customer service today was below par. I called 30 minutes prior to picking up the food and was told it was not busy and it should be ready within 20 mins. As I arrived I can see they had a little lunch rush so that was understandable, but I waited at least 12 minutes standing in front of the cash register to be attended. In the halfway mark of those 12 minutes I asked the lady in the back if I can see if my food was ready but was scolded and told I'm busy right now. After that the owner attended me which I appreciate his kindness and understood that rushes like these happen. But then no later then 15 minutes the owner himself looked to see that no foods were being cooked and the workers were just standing around as if waiting for some to tell them what to do. I'm not sure if there were new workers on shift today or what the case may be but the way Frankensons operated today was not how it usually runs; like a well oiled machine. From being promised a 20 minute wait time, it ended up being well over an hour and 30 minutes as I timed it. I understand restaurants go through this and wait times can be hectic but from being a customer and doing everything correct in regards to ordering prior hand and allowing leeway of time, there comes to a point where it does get ridiculous. I been here before where the line was out the door and even then the wait time was less than what I have experienced today because of how well the workers functioned together. As great as the owner is and as delicious as the food may be, the staff definitely needs shapen up to elevate this business even more.",0.9902
10-Dec-23,"We went to Frankensons because we saw Keith Lee's review on TikTok.  We were not disappointed!  The food was AMAZING and we even got to meet Frank himself!  What a nice gentleman!  He kept it fun by telling us how the restaurant got started and he did a silly little riddle quiz and we won a free order of fried zucchini!  We ordered a pepperoni and sausage pizza, lemon pepper wings, garlic parmesan wings, garlic knots, and a chocolate peanut butter shake.  The garlic knots are huge!  They were my favorite!  We also really enjoyed the garlic Parmesan wings!  We aren't from the area but we will definitely be back again!",0.961
10-Dec-23,"The food at Frankensons is exceptional! Very tasty and well prepared and you can chose among many menu options. I love the service at the place and the owner is so friendly with the guests! He really set the bar high for my entire trip and I will say NO ONE DID CUSTOMER SERVICE BETTER THAN HIM!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!My order:Cheese Pizza, Pepperoni pizza, Garlic knots, Meatballs with marinara, Peach Pineapple Habanero, Lemon Pepper & Hot wings.My Review:The food was good. My favorite item was the pepperoni pizza and my nephew's favorite was the peach pineapple habanero wings. The atmosphere:AMAZING!!!!!! EVERYONE IS SOOOOO FRIENDLY!!!",0.9856

5-Dec-23,"Let me start off by saying the customer service at this place was a 10! Loved the energy and the owner frank was amazing! Loved him.   - pizza was delicious crispy and juicy at the same time.- wings, the hot wings were great the lemon pepper was different not what I'm used too. - garlic knots were huge and super fresh.This is a must try pizza spot for sure!",0.9847
3-Dec-23,We decided to check them out after Keith Lee visit and have to say we are adding them to our list of go to pizzerias.  But it's not just the pizza!  The wings were amazing!  One of my pet peeves is when a wing relays on sauces for flavor and these do not.  We ordered them plain with sauce on the side and the flavor of the wings was great.  The pizza was very surprising how good it was and this is coming from a native NY'er who always takes it as a challenge to see how good pizza can be.  I'm allergic to potatoes but my wife says fries were good and seasoned well.  She enjoyed the Italian sandwich.  Service was great and the place was packed when we came in.  Good to see because their food is on point.,0.993

29-Nov-23,Came here because my boyfriend and I decided to visit Vegas and try Keith Lee approved places. Frankensons was high on our list. I understand why Keith likes Frank so much. He was an absolute delight. He came by everyone's table to check on them and then had us all participate in some trivia before giving us all free garlic knots! He was such a genuine and kind person. The good was absolutely delicious too. I love how much garlic was on the garlic knots! it was delicious!,0.988
27-Nov-23,"This place was SOOOOOO GOOD. and they were so friendly. A must go! We had chicken wings. We were hoping to have a slice of pizza to go, but they didn't have any slices. Will have to go back and get a whole pie!!! Can't wait!",0.7871
26-Nov-23,The Italian sandwich was good and the wings were cooked and seasoned perfect. Ordered food to go wait time was appropriate and didn't take long. The food was still hot when I arrived home. Previously had ordered the Philly cheesesteak and it wasn't as good as the Italian sandwich. Been there twice and would definitely be returning.,0.9042
25-Nov-23,"I didn't know the pizza was build your own, which was fine. Ordered the medium hot wings and fries and a large pizza. Owner said to take home 4 liters of soda however we don't really drink soda. So I only took 2 liters. Everything was delicious and the wings were not greasy or soggy. The ranch was amazing w the special dill. Dill ranch it is. Pizza was delicious too w the gourmet mushrooms instead of the normal pizza mushrooms. Overall delicious and delightful",0.9726
22-Nov-23,"A great local pizzeria unfairly tucked away from prying eyes!!!  The staff here is amazing. They are very friendly and accommodating.As for the pizza, it's the right combination for an absolutely delicious flavor. They're fairly priced which makes the entire experience great.",0.9697
22-Nov-23,I placed an order over the phone for pick up . I got 12 wings and garlic knots I seen the pricing on Yelp 14.99 for 12 wings and 3.99 for garlic knots but to my surprise the total came out to $29.29 . the food portion are huge. Unfortunately my garlic knots were burnt . I like the lemon pepper wings tender and juicy . Seems like there was a price increase. They need to update on yelp!                                           If you place an order over the phone make sure to ask for pricing that was my mistake.                        Pros: the staff was friendly,0.9468
21-Nov-23,"Great service and food. Highly recommend if you want real food. Loved the garlic knots. We got the lemon and pepper / habenero wings great favor.

17-Nov-23,Great customer service! Got the garlic parmesan and lemon pepper wings. Wings were a good size and meaty and flavor was  on point. Definitely satisfied my wings craving. Called in the order and was ready within 25 minutes. Looking forward to trying other menu items!,0.9391
13-Nov-23,"I ordered garlic parmesan and honey mustard wings with a child's cheese pizza. The delivery time took about an hour and 30 minutes which is pretty standard. The customer service was unmatched, the woman who took my order was very pleasant and attentive. The food not so great. The wings were soggy, over powered by oil and flavorless. The parmesan wings were disappointing. The honey mustard sauce was okay. Based on the amount of grease on these wings it's evident they were straight from the fryer and directly into the sauce. I didn't expect fries (cold/hard) at all as I didn't know I was ordering 2 separate meals. I thought I ordered 12 wings and a personal pizza. The pizza was okay. I asked for blue cheese and received ranch and I'm not mad at all. The ranch was really good and complimented the pizza so well. The RANCH was the most flavorful and the best received. Either way, this place was recently hyped up and it could have been a busy/off day. unsure but this isn't a place I would try again & if you do go I would suggest ordering in & you may receive better food.",0.9134

9-Nov-23,"While I searched for a Yelp-rated pizza spot, my son suggested this place based on Keith Lee's tik-tok review. Inside the customer service was friendly and helpful. The seating area is small and was a little messy with some dirty floors, tables, and lots of boxes of supplies. The parking lot wasn't too full, but the wait for the food was long. We didn't mind, but it seemed like maybe they forgot about us? Anyhow, the pizza slices were HUGE! We shared a medium and it was much more than enough for two. We also had the garlic knots that are about the size of a softball. The pizza was delicious with a good flavor and a wood-fired type crust. The knots were soft and bomb. The full ranch was an amazing touch. We ate it for leftover the next day! I would try this place again.",0.9727
9-Nov-23,"Visited Frankensons which became really popular after Keith Lee reviewed this establishment in Vegas. Ordered a wing platter that came with fries, 1 piece of carrot, 1 piece of celery, ranch and blue cheese dressing. The flavor of wings ordered was lemon pepper which leaned on the more zesty side. It wasn't my total favorite for this reason. The cook of the wings were great and had a nice color to it. The ranch dressing was really bomb when paired with the wings and had notes of dill. The fries were generous and tasted good. Disappointed with the lack of celery and carrots the platter was served with. This ran me about $20-25. Pretty affordable for my opinion when ordering wings!! Interior was lacking an inviting feel and look. They do have a back room with additional seating and where I observed most customers coming to eat after ordering or waiting for their order. Parking is ample with no issues!",0.8749

30-Oct-23,"Great food. We ordered the white pizza with sausage, garlic knots and lemon pepper wings. The pizza was delicious. I always love a white pie, when I can find one. The crust was not too thick and not too thin. Nice and crisp. Great flavor. I didn't pay attention when ordering the garlic knots and ordered an order of 12. The knots are huge. You may not be able to eat more than one so don't over order like I did. I think 3 would have been plenty. My son had the lemon pepper wings and he liked them. They were a good size and the flavor was good!Seating is limited inside if you have large parties. Service was prompt and our order was accurate. Prices were reasonable.  It cheap and not hugely expensive.Nice variety of soft drinks for dine in at the fountain. I would come back.",0.9721
29-Oct-23,We loved this place! The staff was very nice. The large pizza is more like an XXL and the slices are the biggest I've ever seen. The flavor of the sauce and crust were great. The garlic rolls were super fresh; crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. The marinara sauce they came with was extremely flavorful. I'd definitely come back!,0.9739
29-Oct-23,Finally got to eat here.  Last time we tried and they had run out of food.  (It was because a viral TikTok review) The pizza was really good.  The wings were good and came with fries that were good.  The ranch dressing was very good.  They pack your food to go which was a little strange but worked out well since there was leftovers and didn't need to ask for a box.  It took a little longer than expected to get the food but was fine.  Definitely would come back,0.9265
28-Oct-23,"My sister and I were visiting Vegas from the East Coast and we'd heard of this place on TikTok. It was always in our plans to go. And boy are we glad we did. We got a smorgasbord so we could try a little of everything. We ended up with 12 wings, 6 garlic knots, and a small meat lovers pizza. The garlic knots are small boulders. The literal biggest garlic knots I've ever seen. They were absolutely coated in fresh garlic, Parmesan, and butter. I believe they came with marinara and it was fantastic. They were even good the second day. The pizza was amazing. The crust was crispy without being too crunchy or too chewy. The flavors were great. I could've done with a touch more sauce but that's just my opinion. I still ate it up. We ate the leftovers for breakfast before the WWWY festival. The wings. I'm not a wing-from-a-pizza-place person but these were the biggest, crispiest, juiciest wings I have ever eaten. If you go to Frankensons and don't get wings, you're majorly missing out. The ranch is so good but it wasn't needed with the garlic parm flavor we got.We ate at the restaurant. There's plenty of seats in the back. I'm not sure if the a/c was broken but it was a little toasty. We didn't care. We sat anyway. There were box fans set up. The staff was so friendly and I believe the owner even spoke to us. 10/10 would recommend this place and if I'm ever in Vegas again I will make a point to visit again.",0.9515
24-Oct-23,"Incredible all around! The service, the food and the atmosphere! The white pizza and the meat lovers are my favorite. The sausage they use is freaking incredible! The Garlic Parm wings *chefs kiss* oh my God and the Italian sub!!!  I wish we had taken more photos!We came here twice and couldn't be happier. Both Frank Jr and Summer have the most warming and welcoming customer service. They were both patient and kind. We came in after my wedding with 11 people and we took over but the customer service only got better. We will come back again and again. This place is golden!",0.9111

3-Oct-23,"We came here this past Saturday night after our trip to Area 15. We were starving when we got here. We were expecting a lot too, since we've seen this place blow up on Tik Tok. When we arrived it was actually fairly busy. It probably took about 40-50 minutes to get our food. Besides that, the inside of Frankensons in fairly small. The ordering area is small and gets bunched up by the door. Around the corner past the soda machine there's probably 6-9 tables. There's some cool artwork on the wall but besides that it's a pretty basic pizza joint. But don't let that fool you at all. The food here was phenomenal. My friend from NY loved the pizza, really we all did. It was soooo good! The garlic knots by themselves were amazing; but we added the meatballs to it and made little sandwiches out of it. Amazing! The one thing I wasn't a fan of was the wings, sadly. We got 18 wings. 9 lemon pepper and 9 peach jalapeño. They sounded really good but when we got them they were really soggy and not really crispy at all. So that was a let down. It's totally fine though, when I come back next I'll just get what I got again minus the wings. Also want to note that the young lady working this last Saturday night was super friendly & helpful. Not to mention patient as well. Not everyone is that way and I appreciate it. That was a bonus to the amazing food! I can't wait to come back and eat more pizza!!",0.9968

18-Sep-23,"Had to stop by forsure after seeing the tik tok review from Keith Lee. We ordered so much stuff for a reasonable price! Everything from the wings to the garlic knots and pizza was a 10/10!! What makes the food even better was the Owner , Frank. He is such an amazing owner and a kind hearted soul! You can tell he cares about his customers and his restaurant. I'm glad my family and I were able to stop by and try Frankensons. We will forsure be back !",0.9309
17-Sep-23,"I do not give five star reviews. Let me say that again, I do not give five star reviews. This place is the real deal. If you want a quality pizza, real, Italian sub, or some of the best chicken wings I've had in 30 years.Girlfriend and I were in town so we had to try it after looking at the reviews online and especially on YouTube. Frank's got a wonderful story and he's a genuine person who interacts well with his clientele. When We arrived he was chatting up a 15-year-old who's having his birthday party here. Everybody seemed to enjoy his interactions . We ordered the Italian sub and pepperoni and sausage pizza and nine each of the lemon pepper, chicken wings and jalapeño peach chicken wings. We also had a vanilla and a chocolate peanut butter shake. Everything was delicious! We spent $76 and everything was well priced. I had enough food to feed six people as the pizza, although only a 14 inch was loaded with toppings! The chicken wings were some of the biggest ones I've ever had. tons of meat very juicy, and the sauces had penetrated to give additional layers of flavor. The Italian sub is the best I've had since I left Chicago 37 years ago.I was expecting one of these dishes to be very good, and the other two to be adequate, but everything was genuinely delicious. I'm a former restaurant owner. I understand quality food. This is the real deal. The shakes were thick with real ice cream and  the flavors are spectacular.If you happen to be in Las Vegas and enjoy quality pizza, excellent chicken wings or a great sub sandwich don't leave without making a visit to Frankensons!",0.9902

3-Sep-23,Ordered a medium pizza and ate inside. The pizza was ok. Had a nice crunch to the dough. It was nothing special but something new to try. The drinks I wanted on their fountain machine were out of order (5 different flavors didn't work). The two girls that work here aren't that friendly. One was wearing a mask and the other one who wasn't wearing a mask was at least more helpful. The owner was sitting having a meeting with other people in the dining room. Place was pretty empty. The ranch dressing was like a herb ranch. Place looked clean. Our table was missing napkins (need refill dispenser). Overall nothing to run too. Owner does seem nice.,0.9241
27-Aug-23,"Stay as far away as you can and don't believe the hype. Let the shop speak for itself. All that tik tok publicity and the shop is extremely empty. The cashier told me I couldnt order light sauce because the sauce was pre assembled and warmed onto the pizza. The pizza tasted OLD, disgusting, and rotten tbh. The pasta flavor was trash and the wings were gooey, full of fat and sog. If I could give 0 stars I would",-0.7713

20-Aug-23,"First time to visit this local Pizzeria, recommended by Keith Lee and my son requested for us to try while here visiting from Californie. And sure enough, it didnt disappoint. We had the freshly baked garlic knots, pizza and lemon pepper wings and all were equally delicious!!! Then the owner Frank, who was so kind had the customers do and guessing game with a prize of the yummy Salted Caramel Pretzel Milkshake.Would recommend, yes at 100%",0.9781
19-Aug-23,"It's disappointing when a place that was initially hyped up doesn't meet expectations. While the food tasted awesome at first, the decline in quality and slow service can definitely impact the overall experience. It's unfortunate when a favorite spot doesn't maintain its standards. TikTok hyped has died and so is this place. Rip",-0.0

17-Aug-23,"Delicious food, amazing service! Stopped by while in town with friends and have never experienced better service. Frank himself chatted with us, entertained us, and told his story while we enjoyed our lemon pepper wings, Italian sub, milkshakes, pasta, garlic knots, and jalapeño knots. Wings and sub were some of the best I've had. Thank you for making it a memorable stop, we will be stopping by the next chance we have to catch up with our new friend!",0.9719
14-Aug-23,"Thanks to Keith Lee we visited this spot. There was no wait we walked in and the owner greeted us at the door. The customer service alone was absolutely amazing. We talked with the owner for a while, it was a group of us so he offered to push some of the tables together so we could all sit together. He even played some trivia games to keep us entertained while we ate. I really would go back just off the customer service he provided alone. For food we ordered Margherita Pizza, Lemon Pepper Wings, Peach Wings, Buffalo Wings and we won a Oreo milkshake while answering a trivia question. The pizza was delicious. As a group everyone enjoyed the Peach Wings the most, followed by the Lemon Pepper then the Buffalo. The milkshake was just the perfect way to end it as a sweet treat it was just enough (not too sweet) but just right. Overall I would definitely go back",0.9558
13-Aug-23,"Do not go there , the food was disgusting and the owner accused us for lying to get a refund . The chicken wasn't even cooked all the way for the wings . We have gone there once before when it become famous on TikTok and that's why we went back but now I know why the business can't keep its customer . Quality of food and customer service was very poor never going back Again",-0.8621

The marinara sauce for dipping is the best I've ever had. Service was excellent. Portion sizes are huge!

4-Aug-23,"I went here because I heard the subs were pretty good on TikTok.  Ordered the classic Italian sub and it was about a 20 minute wait to get my food.  I ate the first half of the sandwich immediately and it was pretty good, but when I got home to eat the other half it was really soggy and inedible for me.  Kinda disappointed because the sandwich cost nearly $16 and I was only able to eat half of it!  Thought the prices for everything on menu were pretty high and probably won't be going back.",0.7895

We had asked for extra lemon pepper seasoning because last time we went they didn't have any seasoning and she said she would put it on the side for us. We didn't receive that either. Honestly disappointed with the service. Food is always good. Double check before leaving",-0.1531

29-Jul-23,"I came here because I love garlic knots and Keith Lee reviewed this place and the garlic knots looked amazing in the videos they post... but when you order the garlic knots those things are burnt and rock hard and don't look like the videos they post. Not soft or buttery. Literally dark brown/black burnt on all the knots, even with my pictures taken with flash... I was disappointed with the knots and I thought the pizza would be better seeing it's a ""pizzeria"" but our pizza lacked flavor and barely any sauce. For the price point, lack of flavor, no wow factor, we will not be back. Maybe it was just our experience (try it and make your own opinion) ‍ but food needs to be the same quality every time for each customer. Not a ""hit"" for tiktok food critics VS a ""miss"" for regular local customers. For reference we did a phone order at 4pm and it was not crazy busy so I'm not sure why the food was so mid. There was some people sitting in the pizza place and I wonder if their food was better. Apparently they had hour lines out the door when Keith Lee posted and It seems like it was just all hype because we are not the only ones who say its mid on yelp and tiktok.",-0.0038

25-Jul-23,"I have been wanting to try this place since they went TT viral.   I don't usually travel to the busy area they used to be located at, so imagine my surprise when I learned they had relocated down the street!!  We ordered a large pepperoni pizza, the sausage pepperoni calzone, the jalapeño poppers and the garlic knots and we raved about every single item!!  OMG.  OMG. OMG.  Check my other reviews, we dine out big and small.  The calzone and poppers were my highlight, my husband is obsessed with the garlic knots and my son LOVED the pepperoni pizza!  We're not supposed to be dining out right now,  but we'll be seeing you soon Frankenson's!  Place was clean and organized, keep up the good work!!",0.9248

Definitely a must place to eat!",0.9795
15-Jul-23,Was so excited to try this place after seeing the great Keith lee review it. And was extremely disappointed. We ordered a 18in cheese pizza with ricotta cheese. Was so anxious to try it. Got home took a bite and there was onions all in the ricotta cheese. EVERYWHERE. Big chunks. I absolutely hate onions. And I've had ricotta cheese from TONS Of places as an Italian. And have never heard of there being onions in ricotta cheese. They should've mentioned the ricotta was made with onions. Would've been helpful and convenient. Cause now I just wasted 45 dollars. Threw the whole pizza away. Very disappointed. Won't return. Gross food not worth the hype.,-0.7281
13-Jul-23,"The owner greeted us at the door and chatted with us for a bit. Super nice guy. Of course we went cause of Keith Lee and we were not disappointed. Pizza was delicious!

The food was pretty good - I didn't really enjoy the peach wings but in their defense I don't really like the mix of sweet and salty in my food -  but I wanted to give it a shot.

(14.99) to be honest, small pizza was way too big and could have been smaller/cheaper in my opinionlots of pizza options in vegas, not sure if I'd try this place again for pizza/calzone. would give the wings a try at some point and the garlic knots again!",0.923
8-Jul-23,"First let me start of the Garlic Knots are more like GARLIC FISTS!! They are huge about the same size as my chihuahuas head. 5/5 for the taste.

I can only imagine the wait when it's busy. Waited for the hype to die down just to waste literally almost an hour waiting for the food. I ended up having to ask for a refund because i was sick of being lied to about how much longer it was gonna be. Absolutely ridiculous. The ac doesn't work it's hot in the building. There are flies all over the place. The ice machine doesn't work. Definitely need a lot of work. Plus the girl that works behind the counter was so rude. Literally so annoying.",-0.978

The cashier girl first gave our knots to another table, where they opened up the box and realized it wasn't theirs. The cashier then gave the same box back to us after the other table was touching all over it. I ended up just throwing them away because we didn't have another 15 minutes to wait around for a new order. The rest of the food was good, especially the calzone and marinara sauce. The owner came out to greet everyone and he seems like a nice guy. I would come back again but I'm just confused how 3 garlic knots take longer to cook than their giant calzone.",0.8957

However, it's lacking flavor.Lemon pepper wings:   Good but not the best.Parmesan garlic wings:   Good, but box was filled with oil.  One person in our family ate it.  He got sick a few hours later.  Seems like he got food poisoning.Ziti:  nothing special but good.Marinara pasta:  nothing special, but delicious.Cleanliness:  not the best.  I placed 1 plate on the garbage can because it was dirty and I also placed another 3 because we didn't need it.  Since we touched it, I didn't want to place it back in the clean area.  A few minutes later, the lady with the huge hair bun, puts the dirty plates back with the clean!  Honestly, if you eat there, I would use a napkin vs a plate.  Service:  our order took forever.  Pizza came out first which was for only one person at our table.  The rest came out maybe 20 mins later.  Probably a total of 1 hour to be served.   The lady apologized and even if it took long, it was fine since we were all talking.  Giving them a 3 because I feel they could do better and I don't want their ratings to go too much down :). Good luck!",0.9756

15-Jun-23,"So let me start out with saying I was so looking forward to trying this place. Once I heard about the hype. And how good the food was. It must be good when there is a 2 hour wait. So I wait a few months after that to try it. If I hadn't used my gps I wouldn't of found it. The sign is so small and not very legible. Upon enter the place it was clean and I was greeted by the staff. Nothing special as in decor. Just your red and white pizza style place. The menu is huge. I order a large pepperoni pizza,garlic knots, and lemon pepper wings. I got my order for take out. It took 20 mins. When we got home and started eating  the pizza. The amount of grease ruined the pizza. The crust had no flavor. Not a good pizza at all. But on the other hand. The garlic knots were loaded with garlic and cheese. They were so good. The wings are huge. And the lemon pepper on them tasted so good. This is what saved this place. But sadly enough to say. If you like wings and knots you gotta try this place.",0.9713
14-Jun-23,Worst experience ever with a manager! Was extremely rude and let Keith Lee's reviews go to his head. Can't wait for his business to die down so his 15 mins of fame can be over. Never let your ego get the better of you just for a little spot light.,-0.7773

Overrated!",-0.715
11-Jun-23,"20 -25 minute wait time just for tenders and plain cheese personal pizza. The fries were good but, the pizza with its flavorless crust and the thin breaded chicken tenders were just OK. I prefer GREAT food (obviously). I can surely enjoy GOOD food. And I can reluctantly indulge in OK food at times. Given the fact that your dining out, food options drop significantly once it hits 10:00 PM here in Las Vegas. And Frankenson stays open till 11:00pm. There's a decent chance that I might return to try out their lemon pepper wings that I've seen images of on yelp. I optimistically hope that they taste as GREAT as they look. At the very least I hope they're GOOD. But I wouldn't be surprised if they were just OK given my previous experience....... Only time will tell.",0.9961

Me and my wife ordered some wings, a cheese pizza, and garlic knots. Wow. The food was very delicious. The quality and flavor was absolutely on point. The ranch was more dilly or some herby, but overall good. The pizza slices were huge and very good. Crunchy crush and a great layer of cheese. The sauce was a great flavor that stood out in a great way. Pick up, the lady was just as friendly as before and even called to let me know my order was ready on the drive over. Staff was friendly, the paintings on the window were fun and the experience has definitely made me a customer. We have already picked out what we want to try on our next visit.

I'm just confused I seen this place on tiktok and this is not at all what I expected. Very disappointed!

I'm glad he did because they were the star of the meal.,0.968

The wings were cooked perfectly, the lemon pepper was not my favorite, it had too much lemon could not taste anything else just lemon.

27-May-23,"Following in the foot steps of the great Keith Lee, as new locals to Las Vegas we had to try it out.Overall the staff was friendly and sweet, very forthcoming about the size, and it lived up to its name. As for food here is what we got:1. Small 5-0. This is their take on Hawaiian pizza but with a bit of a flair with green peppers and bacon. Anything is better with BACON! However, our one down side is the cheese ratio. It was just too much for the thin slice. $20.992. Garlic Knots: holy garlicky! It was a punch of raw garlic. I feel like it needed some parm to calm down the raw feeling. It was flavorful- and the bread was doughy. It was just too much oil for our liking. 3 for $4.993. 6-piece Lemon Pepper Wings: now THIS! is what I would come back for. These wings were top notch and bursting with flavor. Absolutely must get. However the fries are meh! $11.99 Overall it lives up to the size of monstrosity. The ambiance of the place is pretty laid back and chill. It's not overwhelming and I feel as if the hyped has died down a bit that it's not too long of a wait.",0.9695
26-May-23,"DUDE homemade dill ranch. Best thing ever! It's  so delicious. They gave us three big containers with our medium pizza. It was a thicker consistency and you can tell how much dill they put into it. I would just go there again because of how how of a ranch lover I am.  The person on the phone wasn't kidding when she said their pizzas were big and that just the two of us would have leftovers. Service was amazing and they even delivered to our house for a low fee. It took exactly the amount of time that she quoted over the phone. Thanks Samantha! We don't eat pizza often, but we definitely needed a treat last night. The Buffalo chicken pizza was great. The spice level was perfect. The only thing we thought is that the pizza was a little dry and could use more red sauce. But we will be back to try more things on the menu.",0.9833
23-May-23,i was very excited to finally try this place after all the amazing reviews. To say I was highly disappointed is an understatement. First it took 30 min just to get my food so my lunch was over by the time i even got the food i ordered. To have one person cooking food and preparing it at lunchtime is kind of disapointing. The garlic knots have so much garlic on them that's all u taste. The lemon pepper wings taste NOTHING like lemon pepper wings are supposed to taste. Plus they have chili flakes all over them. Whoever thought that was a good idea needs to be fired. They were over cooked and the fries were just blah. So not only did i waste my whole lunch time just to get this food. I then couldn't even eat it. Sadly i will not be returning.,-0.1476
22-May-23,"so like many of the review you see i came here after watching keith on tik tokim really an easy person to please so cant really bash other reviews who seem to be really opinionatedFood - i ordered the Keith bundle..... i have some discrepancies with Keith as pizza is just like every other mom and pop..... i love them so don't worry i'm not bashing. The wings were very good as it had just enough flavor in each one (wingstop for example gambles with too much or too little lemon pepper) i ordered the garlic knots with it and definitely order 3 as they're fat and drenched with garlic which I LOVE; however the most prized item is the classic Italian sadly i have to say it was average in my opinion because i had driven all around vegas visiting multiple restaurants ordering everything where it got a bit soggy and i couldn't fully enjoy it as the bread made the texture weird (next time i'm dining in) Service - the girl i initially was helped with seem new but i don't care she answered every question i had which is EASY instead of me figuring what Keith ordered she knew exactly what I was aiming for and filled the order innow what made me give it a 5 star..... its not like i expect it, but like Keith the owner came and introduced himself. I got to learn about his family and quite FRANKly he surprised me with all his knowledge about my culture. I had to test him with simple questions and he far surpassed it along with a fun conversation about history.I definitely will be back as im tired of the Italian food on the strip and probably start introducing this place to my friends",0.9872
21-May-23,"I got the pizza, garlic knots, and chicken fingers and it was all delicious!  I did takeout, but I had been there before for dine-in.  While it takes a while to get your food, it's worth the wait.  The owner, Frank, was there, checking on everyone as they waited. Even 5 months after blowing up on Tik Tok, they are still busy getting orders over the phone and still looking for help.  That's a good kind of busy for a business to have. As for ambiance, this place has a nice feel of being a family-owned pizza shop.",0.9441
19-May-23,"The owner was terrific, it was a hot day and he served us EDC folk a free Gatorade! Bless him and his business. 11/10 - serviceFood - 10/10 Ordered the peach chutney, lemon pepper wings and garlic knots. Definitely a go-to spot.",0.9041
18-May-23,"This place was good! The owner, Frank, was so nice and friendly. I had no idea that the place had gone viral until I went, it just looked like an interesting place! The food was good, don't get the chicken tenders. They're not good at all. The decorations and the paint job was so cool! The people were friendly and the pizza was so good. Keep up the good work, Frankensons!",0.9859
17-May-23,"Friendly staff and good food overall.Everything that was ordered for the table: Jalapeño cheese knots - a few slices of jalapeños and a little cheese on their pizza crust. Tasty, just wished there was more cheese/jalapeño!Caesar salad - standard salad with what may be house made croutons? Ziti pasta- I honestly thought the sauce was a bit bland but the rest of the table liked it.Meatballs- didn't try but the rest of the table said they were good.White pizza (Ricotta, Romano, garlic, olive oil, mozzarella) and added pepperoni- this pizza was so good. Great taste from first bite to last! Adding pepperoni was a great choice on our part! The crust is so fluffy. I feel like with the dough, If they experiment with cinnamon sugar and some icing, they could try a dessert pizza or dessert bread sticks!If It weren't for Keith Lee, I would have never known about this place. I'd come back whenever I make it back to Vegas!",0.985
17-May-23,Customer service was fantastic. Summer was  patient and courteous. I could tell they  were short staffed. The classic Italian sub was delicious. The chicken fingers needed a little more seasoning. Overall I was pleased with the service and the food.,0.926
15-May-23,"All around bomb I made the mistake of over ordering (not rlly a mistake) I got pizza, single ,knots and sandwich and paid around $80 i had leftovers for DAYS  I met the owner he was very kind and welcoming and the quality of food matches the great service %100 recommend",0.8341
14-May-23,"Dudeeee the garlic knots blew me and my fiancee's mind. I'm not even a garlic knot  kind of guy and these were incredible. So much deliciously seasoned garlic on top of them and the bread was so incredibly fresh and made to perfection. We also got hot wings, peach jalapeño chutney wings, and lemon pepper sauce wings. They were all so freaking yummy and cooked to perfection. The flavors were unreal. It was hard to pick my favorite. I don't understand any negative reviews. I'm a foodie and this place is next level. The owner is also very down to earth too. He makes an effort to make you feel welcomed.",0.9695
12-May-23,"I mean, I've been on a hunt for good Buffalo chicken fingers. I came here at out the recommendation from a friend and I wasn't impressed. It's just not for me. The fries, the chicken, the sauce and the ranch... nope. Why do you add so much dill on your ranch? I was gonna grab a bigger order and take some to my husband to eat for lunch but he said for me to try it first and we'd go from there. Glad I waited because I hate paying for food that I have to throw away after 1 bite. The hunt for good chicken finger's is still on. Idk about the rest of the menu but I doubt I'll be giving them a second chance.",0.7025
8-May-23,From California and Saw on tic tok and have to say it was as good as he said it was. Highly recommend,0.6901
8-May-23,"Let me start by saying this food is bomb!!!! I've been 3 times and had tried the garlic knots, peach habanero wings, lemon pepper wings and my favorite thing on the menu... the Philly cheesesteak. Bruh!! Between the garlic knots and the cheesesteak, I couldn't stop telling ppl about it. Definitely lives up to the hype. The owner, Frank, he's the man!! Cool as ever and he makes it his business to interact with the customers. I will say please come into this establishment expecting to wait for your food. It is made fresh to order and worth the wait. It's irritating seeing ppl coming in going off on the staff for their orders taking long. What do you expect when it's a place that went viral on TikTok?! You want quick or you want quality?! However if your wait is TOO long, Frank is quick to resolve the issue. I've witnessed it first hand. You want my recommendation, get the Philly!! YUM!!",0.9618
8-May-23,"The Food here is great! I love the pizza and wings, but my favorite thing to get is the Italian sub. The portion sizes are big and I always feel full and satisfied after I'm done eating. Also the staff is super friendly, nice and makes you feel at home. In particular Symantha the cashier answered all of my questions and made sure I was taken care of. I can't wait to eat here again!",0.9882
8-May-23,"Never believe influencers on Tik Tok! This place made out because of Keith and you would think the owner would take that good fortune and all that money and actually make the food worthy! The first time I tried it after waiting for months to get in the place, the pizza was good (not great, but good enough) the second time it wasn't good. Seems they should concentrate on having a few good items instead of offering such a big menu. How hard is it to make good, quality pizza?!!!!!",0.9731
7-May-23,"Went to Frankensons for the first time today.  Excellent customer service,  Great pizza.  Want to thank Frank for the shirts and the conversation about LA. and Fort Polk.We live on the other side of town, but will definitely be back.",0.8537
6-May-23,"This place was so good! Started out by seeing it on TikTok and knew I had to try it! When you're craving fresh tasting pizza this is the place! The garlic knots are huge which was awesome,and our food easily fed 2 people. Cant wait to come back!",0.8981

5-May-23,"I stopped here on my way back to California because of Kieths tik tok(go figure) The garlics knots were super fluffy & flavorful, based on the reviews I put some napkins at the bottom so they wouldn't soak up all the  excess oil. Either way I enjoyed themWings were good, crispy on the outside & practically falls off the bone. I wish we had tried the lemon pepper as well but I'll have to save that for next time. The fries were well seasoned a crispyThe pizza was also super good & is huge even for a small. Altogether we spent $43. The only downside was there was no music & the employees were super quiet so it was just kinda awkwardly quiet in there Lol. Overall I really enjoyed it, the portion sizes are generous & everything tasted good. We had plenty to take home for leftovers",0.9921
3-May-23,"That guy Keith must've hit the dispensary or something before he made his Tiktok video. I live around the corner so I'd been waiting for the hype to die down before I tried this place. The wings were actually some of the worst I've ever had. I only ate 1 and a half out of 12 and tossed the rest. I don't think I've ever done that in my entire life with wings. The garlic knots were ok but came soaked in about 1 full inch of oil/grease at the bottom of the container so if you don't eat them all right away they are completely soggy with grease. Pizza was way too doughy and lacked any real flavor at all. It's a shame one post on social media is giving so much business to this place instead of the other great pizza places in the area. Also, they jacked their prices up by almost DOUBLE on most of their popular items. Prices on the site are way outdated.",0.7427

2-May-23,"Frank, you're a fucking G man! Keith Lee led my girlfriend and I here for our first trip to Vegas and it exceeded our expectations easily. The menu variety is insane and all generously portioned for the value. We had garlic knots, wings and the 5-0 and enjoyed the struggle to tackle it. The taste and size of all of it was amazing and makes me question eating pizza in LA ever again! The owner Frank is very personable and talks to each customer personally with us having a long talk about our times in the burgh on draft night. I don't think our trips there going forward will never not include a stop here and I hope you think the same!",0.9156
1-May-23,"Food is absolutely delicious, but the service needs a LOT of work. Each time I've attempted to call to order food, I have waited over 30 mins per time just to even get someone on the phone. I'll usually just drive down to the restaurant and order there. However, that is another hour process. The cashiers are usually unfriendly and never greet the guests or let me know ""it will be a minute/thank you for waiting so long"" etc. Each time I've waited around an hour for my food, even though the cashier tells me the wait time is way less. Each time no one ever apologizes for the long wait either. I'm discouraged to come back and dine here because of the bad service, which is a shame because the food (especially the garlic parmesan wings) is so good.",-0.8654
1-May-23,"Been waiting for a long time to try out this very popular pizza place. We were excited when we pulled up and there was no line. Yes!! Being the first time here we were trying to read the menu. The menu layout made it difficult for us to read and decide what to get. We ended up getting 2 types of wings, meat lovers pizza, garlic knots and drinks. I wish I liked my experience more than I did. While ordering our food and being obviously confused about the menu the girl taking our order offered almost no help. That's ok though, it just took us longer to order. My wife asked the girl if they had iced tea and the girl looked like she didn't know but said no. My wife walked over to the drink machine and saw that they did have iced tea. In fact they had several version of iced tea. Walking to the the dinning area I noticed that the floors were very very greasy.I found this concerning because we were the first ones in the restaurant when the doors opened. The chicken wings were great. Lots of flavor but there was lots of oil on the bottom. It soaked out French fries and the wings that were on the bottom. That same oil problem was an issue for the garlic knots. When we picked one up it just dripped off the bottom of the knot because they were sitting in a pool of oil.  The oil also had a red tint to it. Not sure if it was the color of the paper coming off or just the type of oil they used. I think plain wings would be awesome. They had such a great crunch to them and they were a good meaty size too. I would get the pizza again because it had a good crust and good sauce.",0.9852
30-Apr-23,"Aye, me hearty's!Listen up, ye scallywags! I got a tale to tell ye about Frankiestiens, the best darn pizzeria in all the seas. This place is run by a man named Frank, a real salt of the earth kinda guy, if ye know what I mean. Everytime I steps me boots inside his establishment, he treats me with love and respect, and he ain't no phony. And he don't just do that fer me, mind ye, he does it with all his costumers, so give this man a fair shake, will ye?I'm writing this missive to me fellow pirates who have some smarts in their noggins. I reckon it's our duty to support local businesses, especially ones that offer such fine grub and hospitality as Frankiestiens. The pizzas are made with fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection, and the service is top-notch, like the sails on me ship. Whether ye be stopping by for a quick bite or bringing the whole crew fer a feast, Frankiesteins is the place to be.So, me hearties, I implore ye to hoist anchor and make way to Frankiesteins. We can show our support for a fella who takes care of his customers like they be part of his crew. Arrr, me belly growls just thinkin' about it!Yours truly,Pirate",0.9885

28-Apr-23,"If you're looking for a more pub style approach to pizza, this is might be a decent option if you're in the area. It's definitely not NY style pizza and it's heavy on the cheese.After this spot blew up on TikTok, we had to try it. Especially since we pass it daily - we had seen it was new but it just said pizza and wings on it so we didn't think much. We ordered in January but are sharing the review now since Yelp didn't allow reviews.We tried to let the fame die down before trying this spot and called within an hour after opening to be sure the wait wasn't long. We placed our order for pickup with only a 25-30 minute wait.WHAT WE ORDERED:Medium Pepperoni Pizza12 Piece Wings - half lemon pepper / half mild6 Piece Garlic KnotsPROS:- Pizza was large- Ranch looked homemade and pretty delicious- Wings were delicious from size to sauce (the medium sauce was great!)- Garlic knots had tons of flavorCONS:- Pizza was very cheesy and not consistent on pizza and overall very greasy- Lemon pepper wings were very light compared to what I was expecting, still good, but not my personal favorite- Fries were subpar- Garlic knots weren't knots, they just looked like garlic balls which was disappointing because the point of a garlic knot is the knot with all the garlic- Prices were way more than what is on websiteOverall, if we were hosting friends and wanted a more pub style versus New York style pizza, we'd order Frankensons for them mainly because it's close to us right now. I wouldn't go out of my way for it.My biggest disappointment was the pricing which was not transparent on their website or phone order even though that is the menu the girl taking my order referenced. She also kept harping on Keith Lee which is fine but some people may not know who that is. Also who's palette is not the same as mine apparently. 6 Garlic Knots - $6.99 / Website Says $3.9912 Wings - $18.99 / Website Says $14.99Medium Pizza  - $19.99 / Website Says $16.99Toppings are still $2.25 extraWe paid almost $16 extra after tax.",0.9689
27-Apr-23,This place is 10 stars out of 5! Everything here was wonderful! The best garlic knots you'll ever try and the pizza is so good and I'm from Chicago so that says a lot! But the best part of this place is the owner and staff bringing what it means to have excellent service! We will definitely be back many times!,0.9747
27-Apr-23,"The food itself deserves a 5 star because it was absolutely delicious! We just placed our first order over the phone for pick up and the serving sizes were way bigger than we expected. Pizza was delicious, not to much sauce and the cheese pull was great! Great quality. The wings had a crispy flavorful breading and were very meaty. Not a huge fan of the ranch, too much seasoning there or something. The garlic knots were so good along with the pesto and marinara sauce. The biggest frustration was when we looked at the receipt after we finished. We ordered based on the website as again this was our first order. Completely understand food costs have changed recently but we were never told when we placed the order than the prices online aren't the same as they are now charging which apparently someone was supposed to say according to the girl I spoke with when I called back. When my husband even picked it up he said no one told them the price was any different and they took the payment over the phone so I really didn't think about the overall price when I paid. The girl when I called back said it's been months since she's worked there and the prices still haven't been updated and that they increased the price again 3 days ago. We paid $15 more than we expected between the slight $2 price increase for 2 medium pizzas, $2 for the price increase of wings and the biggest frustration was the $9 increase for the garlic knots. We figured we'd place the order for 12 vs 6 because it wasn't a huge price difference as advertised. The manager Sam was nice and explained they've been trying to get ahold of the guy who does the website to update it but honestly if it's been months then there really needs to be something more done and absolutely make sure that your staff explains on every single phone order that the prices are not accurate as advertised. We will definitely be back because we truly enjoyed the food and my husband said Frank was very kind when he picked the food up. But just really frustrated by the false advertising.",0.9867
24-Apr-23,"My pizza was burnt black, on the bottom. I ordered sausage on my medium pizza and there were maybe 2 or 3 crumbs of sausage on some of the pieces one of them had one. The pie was tasty if they didn't scrimp on the topping and burn the bottom it would have been a five star review.The service was nothing out of the ordinary other than the girl on the phone couldn't seem to get my CC information straight, after three times I just asked her to ""please put my order in"" so I'm not sitting there wasting my evening The ambiance was alright, there were three big big women sitting right at the counter, legs stretched out like they owned the place. I smiled at them but they just looked right through me. Not a pleasant first experience.",0.3971
23-Apr-23,"Ok so let's start off by saying I'm a local and I literally live right up the street from Frankensons, very convenient.. However, I've been to this place a number of times before Keith Lee's Tik Tok review and the food was hands down soooo good! Unfortunately the experience I had today 4/23/23 was the worst ever! We ordered for take out.. we ordered the breaded zucchini planks (which were not breaded at all) and we ordered a medium cheese pizza.. The website states ""BREADED zucchini planks"" when we got home after picking up the order the zucchini planks were not BREADED and looked soggy and raw with a light sprinkle of grated cheese and parsley, I didn't even try them I got back in the car and drove back to return them for a refund! The pizza was meh ! The sauce on the pizza was thick like mud and had absolutely no taste! Besides the fact that the prices on line are waaaaay different than what is posted in the restaurant which is completely deceiving.. we ordered 2 items that came to $31.00 dollasss, really??? The owner was there and I explained that it would be in his best interest to make the changes online to what his customers would actually be paying and not surprised by a 10-15 dollaaaa difference when you get there.. so dissatisfied and disappointed to say the least! The customer service is and always has been on point so I won't knock that! The ambiance is what it is, they have a small dining area and it looks pretty clean from where you can see from the front counter where you order.. with all this being said, we unfortunately will not be back! I think Frank needs to take a minute or 2 to read all these low rated reviews that including myself have posted! This place went from EPIC to don't waste your money or time! I would hate to see him have to close his doors because he didn't take the time to really consider the true reviews of his place! Make the change and make it better or lock it up! Good luck to anyone that orders from this place!",0.9004

I placed my order of pepperoni pizza, lemon pepper wings, and garlic knots The cashier looked bored and definitely didn't like her job. The pizza was just OK, the wings were awful barely any seasoning, but the garlic knots were really good. The wait from arrival to leaving was two hours!  This was three months ago and not worth a return visit. Also, prices are outrageous!",0.2379

I wanted to try it to support a local business and show support after the Kieth Lee video, but it shouldn't take two hours to get one pizza when they have multiple ovens. It is very obvious that none of the employees were trained on restaurant biz at all, customer service lacked and even when it inst busy, the food still took forever. I wanted to support them but I will not go back, and I do not recommend going here to anybody. Luckily Im a local and didn't have to travel far for this, I feel bad for anyone who did.

14-Apr-23,"They wouldn't let me post this back when we ate at this place but I have been waiting for yelp to allow posts. It is not worth the wait.  We, as most of you, justified the 45 minutes wait to just put in our order because of all the hype.  Then we sat down and waited another 45 minutes before our items started to come out.  Yes, our 3 pizzas, wings, and calzone all came out over a 30 minute period. Wings were over cooked, calzone was still doughy, and the sausage pizza I ordered was the worst pizzas I have ever tasted.  So disappointing.  I mean who minces the sausage?  The sauce was off as well.  For the price, this pizza should have been amazing but it was the opposite.  I only had two pieces of my pizza which has never happened in my life.  Needless to say the four of left most of our food uneaten.

12-Apr-23,"Came all the way from Arizona to try Keith Lee's famous review spot!Visited on Saturday April 8, 2023 around lunch timeThe location:It's easy to find but minimal parking. The store itself is split in an odd way. It's like two suites combined with a little hall way between the kitchen in one and seating in the other. The seating is also minimal. Tables next to the kitchen were super wobbly and tried to fix it with napkins. Because our family was a party of 5, there was no seating for us and we moved to the back seat of our car. A bit difficult to feed the kids this way but made due. The customer service:The was the most disappointing part of the whole experience. There was no line but all tables were filled. I walked up to order and told her we were there because of Keith Lee and boy did she not even care. I mean this guy was bringing people from out of state to your pizzeria and you're not even going to acknowledge the connection on why these new customers just told you they showed up? I do have to say, Frank was not there probably enjoying the Easter weekend (as he should!) it's just too bad the one customer facing associate lacked customer service. From my experience visiting so many restaurants, that first interaction with the employee either makes or breaks the whole visit. So needless to say, I was a bit bummed! The food:To piggyback off the last comment, when I ordered the food, it came with 3 kids meal drinks and I asked for 1 large fountain soda cup for myself. After paying, we walk over to the fountain drinks and every single drink besides Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew were all out. It would of been nice to tell your customers the soda is practically all out during purchasing especially when there are 3 kids involved. We didn't want our kids drinking either of those 3 options. So we had to in line now that there was one and order a 2 liter. I know things are still hectic and I would of been understanding and just got the 2 liter right then and there during my original purchase of I was told off the bat. I tried to ask if there was any soda in the back if they would be refilling any time soon and let's just said she was unimpressed with my questioning - didn't even get a sorry for the hassle. We finally got our food in a reasonable amount of time. Had to ask for extra napkins and off to eat in the back of our car... I'll rate each item below:Pizza:The only good thing to come out of this situation. The pizza was yummy! Not the ultimate best but definitely good. Had a lot of cheese so if someone isn't a cheese lover you might want to ask go easy on the cheese. But for me, it was the perfect amount. Crust was soft. Not thin not thick just normal. Lemon pepper wings:A bit dry but good flavor. The ranch and I think blue cheese dressing tasted good but I couldn't get down with being messy in the car unfortunately. Peach chutney wings:Didn't like these at all. The sauce made the crispy part of the wings soft and wet and the texture was yuck for me. The garlic rolls:I think they were called knots but definitely not knots. They are big huge rolls. They just had butter flavor and chucks of garlic on top. Nothing too exciting. I got overwhelmed with how much bread I had to eat for just one. Chicken tenders kids meal:You have the choice of fries or Mac and cheese with the tenders. Two kids got the fries the other got the Mac and cheese. I didn't try these but the ones that had the fries scarfed the whole meal down no problem. The one with the Mac and cheese didn't like it. I was surprised on how much Mac and cheese came with it and even more surprised the chicken was stuck in the middle of the Mac and cheese. Kids usually like their food separated so maybe in the future they can give less mac and cheese and put it to the side? TL;DR:It was okay  I wouldn't crave this joint but if I'm in the area might swing by to grab some pizza. Room for improvements:- more training on customer service for the cashier - put up some signage when the soda is out - fix the tables that are super wobbly- I truly think if this place chose to either be a restaurant OR only take out would help. When we walked in it was definitely take out vibes. But then they have seating in another room.  If they took out the seating, made it take out only and converted that room to storage and supplies I think it would help. OR make the entrance and ordering process more restaurant friendly - make it feel like you're in a restaurant. Anyways hope this helps! If you need any other advice, DM me on IG!",0.996
12-Apr-23,"I saw all of the hype that a friend shared with me on TikTok and since we live just down the street, we figured that we needed to give it a try.  For a few months after the TikTok video review went viral, it was almost impossible to get in and order without having to wait for over an hour.  I loved how much the community came together to help a small business out and I know how grateful the owner was too.  Once it slowed down some, we went in and ordered take out (we live only about 3 minutes away) - the Garlic Knots (5 stars, they are extra large in size compared to other pizza places and the portion size is really good for the price, they have loads of real minced garlic, and a yummy butter sauce), Italian Sub (5 stars, when other restaurants are reducing the amount of meat on their subs or charging extra, this is a very solid sub with a lot of meat and served warm), Pizza (4 stars, this is a good pizza, we got the meat lovers) and Lemon Pepper wings (3 stars, I have some constructive criticism here.....the wings had a good flavor but a suggestion would be to order them plain with the sauce on the side because they were so soggy when we got home and who likes soggy wings?  We ordered again after this and I ordered them plain with the sauce on the side and added the sauce to the crispy wings when I got home and it was much better and stayed crispy.  I would even ask a customer when taking an order if they would like the sauce on the side to put on at home...it makes a huge difference....literally from a 2 star wing to a 5 star wing).  The wings come with fries (2 stars) and it was the same with the fries, they were just so soggy when we got home but nothing an air fryer couldn't fix, but there is nothing special about the fries (I am a total fry person so when a business makes hand cut fries, I am a huge fan).  I also think that the carrots and celery should be wrapped separately whether in the box or outside because those also get hot and soggy if you are taking them to go and that is not appealing.  Another suggestion would be to allow customers to order either all flats or all drums only since some people like one or the other.  Other than that, it was a good experience and we will continue to be customers.",0.9902
12-Apr-23,It was very mid. Pizza was greasy and not flavorful. Meh. Girls at the front seemed very new,0.0572
11-Apr-23,Came here after seeing a TikTok. Boy was this place packed. But once I got my food & got home to eat. Boy was it good. The buffalo chicken wings are amazing.... Lots of meat on the wings & the sauce is dripping. The pizza was better then any pizza I had in the past. Highly recommend this joint plus the owner Frank came out and introduced himself to everyone standing in line,0.9079
11-Apr-23,Lemon pepper wings are a hit very fresh. Love the pizza. Been more than 3 times already.,0.7947
10-Apr-23,"We totally fell for the fluff piece about this place in the rj. First off a large 2 topping and garlic knots is 50 bucks. Ouch, but I could see it if the food was absolutely killer too bad it's not. The garlic knots are massive which would be cool but they are dough covered in massive chunks of raw garlic and parsley. At least mince it if your going to kill us with raw garlic, I still taste it days later. No one else would finish one and I made it the through half before they went into the garbage. Now for the pizza. It's the most lack luster pizza I have yet to have, the sauce taste like is straight out of a very cheap can. The crust is good but the sauce kills what could be a decent pizza. The only thing this place has going for it is the portions are stupid huge. But it's like dropping 50 bucks for a over sized little Ceasers. There are 2 very solid pizza places within two miles that are half the price and substantially better. If you found this due to to the feel good article just feel good about it and keep your wallet in your pocket.",-0.6903
7-Apr-23,"KY resident here, we came to Vegas for an anniversary trip. We follow Keith Lee on TikTok and he reviewed Frankenson's on one of his videos, so we decided to check it out. This place is Fantastic! We had the best food AND service! Frank is awesome, he stayed out and talked with everyone the whole time and gave us all free t-shirts! If you're in the Vegas area, I would definitely recommend Frankenson's!",0.9704

4-Apr-23,Had to try this place out and what better way than to cater for the office! From pick up all the employees were so kind and appreciative! They did not disappoint especially for things coming out in large quantities. The white pizza was amazing and the wings were all cooked to perfection!,0.9711
3-Apr-23,"I went to this restaurant with an open mind after Keith's review. I got a large pepperoni, garlic knots and lemon pepper wings. Let me just say that i truly wanted to like the food, but i just didn't. The pizza imo was a third rate pizza. Too much cheese and it was overwhelming. I did not like the taste at all. I would pretty much rather eat just about any other company's pizza over this one. It was also ridiculously over priced at 25 dollars. I could see someone who likes lemon pepper liking the wings. I got them because keith lee seemed blown away by them. For me i just was not my cup of tea and i thought it was ridiculous that they smothered the fries that it came with in pepper. The garlic knots were ok. Personally i do not think i would come back here. There are too many pizza restaurants that i would rather go to.",0.9118
3-Apr-23,"BEST SANDWICH we've ever had! Everything was delicious, just the Italian hoagie was the bomb! Order it hot and be sure to get a milkshake. We did Oreo and peach but we'll be back because the owner even came out and chatted with us and said to try the salted caramel shake. Thank you to the owner, Frank for making our dining experience even more special. Oh and don't forget the lemon pepper wings because the meal wouldn't have been complete without them. Delicious! Also, to Keith Lee for the recommendation- it did not disappoint - 10 out of 10",0.9374

2-Apr-23,"Yes, I am here from Keith Lee's Tik Tok as well so it pains me to say I was not impressed AT ALL. This was my first time being able to try after MONTHS due to not living in the area and any time I've come it was way too busy or the store was closed early. Can never call and order because I've been hold for 15 minutes each time before giving up (though I saw two phone ordered being placed while waiting for my order). I was so excited to be able to try Saturday (4/1) night after a much anticipated wait. We ordered a small barbecue chicken pizza, 6 piece wing in the peach chutney sauce, and the peach shake. We waited about 25 minutes after ordering until our food was ready, which isn't bad in my opinion. The restaurant was pretty busy still just not overly crowded. I first tried my shake and was very happy with it. I love a good milkshake and that was my first peach milkshake! I'm a veggie pizza kind of girl and when I get meat, it's always a barbecue chicken pizza. So trust that I've had my fair share of barbecue chicken pizzas when I say that this one was the ABSOLUTE WORST. It was beyond disappointing. The chicken was huge chunks (think boneless chicken wing size) so there were only a few pieces. Didn't immediately see the onion but realized it was under the cheese. There was barely any barbecue sauce on the pizza! It was the most basic barbecue chicken pizza ever, I promise a frozen pizza would have been better. I'm used to the chicken being cut up more and spread over the pizza evenly and definitely more of a barbecue sauce taste but not here! The wings were lightly fried and then topped with a wet sauce, so they were a bit soggy. The wing sauce also didn't have a strong flavor either. I'm mad that my plan was to have left over pizza since I ordered wings too but I ate two slices out of pure hunger and was done. I love Keith's reviews and LOVED another place he recommended but this place just isn't it!! I don't know if the quality has fell off or what but I know for certain that barbecue chicken pizza needs some attention. Please look at the picture and let me know if you've ever seen a BBQ chicken pizza that looked like that. Really thought I had the wrong pizza at first. Would not be back, not even for the delicious peach shake.",0.9875
2-Apr-23,Food was way overrated by Keith lee on tic tok.     Shows he doesn't know true Italian food.    Customer service is a total bust.   If you want true Italian food...  go down the street to Stallones.,-0.521

Plenty of toppings and the crust is wonderful! We got sweet bbq, garlic Parmesan and lemon pepper wings. They were big and not too greasy. The sauces were all great! The positions are very generous. We ordered about twice what we needed but no complaints about leftovers! This is our new favorite pizza restaurant!",0.8301

1-Apr-23,"Sorry Frank, I have to leave this.  My wife and I were really looking forward to trying your food. It was a small reason for choosing to go to Vegas for spring break.  After reading another yelp review about deceptive pricing, I made sure to write down the price for everything we were going to order.  According to your own website, the price should have been $36, but when the girl on the phone told me $54 I told her to cancel everything. I understand prices can go up, but then you need to update the site.  If I hadn't read the previous review, I probably  would have been scammed by you into paying the extra 50%! TOTALLY  UNACCEPTABLE!",-0.884
31-Mar-23,"Really wanted to love this place but alas, here we are. My family arrived around 3pm on a Friday to a mildly busy restaurant. The staff took our order - 1 lg pizza, a 6pc garlic balls, an 18pc wing, and a salad. We were told the wait would be about 45-60min for the wings, which we agreed to. They were right about the wait time for the wings, I'll give them that. What they didn't mention was that while our wings, pizza and garlic bread were getting cold, the chef was in the back garden waiting for the romaine to grow...yes, I'm being facetious but it took another 30 min for them to make the salad. So yeah, that left much to be desired. I'm glad they've gotten publicity and all but there definitely needs to be more automation and systems in place to balance food prep, online orders, and customers. The garlic balls and peach habañero wings were fire, so that's a win.",0.9622
31-Mar-23,First experience was terrible. Expected the inside to be themed but it was just like a regular old pizza shop. Spent $50 for 2 pizzas to get home and have them be burned. I heard the owner talking to his staff very rudely. To be honest if my boss spoke to me like that I would probably burn all the pizzas as well. Waste of money. Will not be supporting.,0.0004
30-Mar-23,"The power of Social Media's Tik Tok is real @Frankensons! Yep. after seeing Kieth Lee's vid and many social media post I just had to give it a try and support this local biz. Frank's business was struggling and after a post by food critic Kieth Lee, business was BOOMING! Owner Frank didn't expect and wasn't prepared for his shop to be this super busy, he event stopped all on-line, Uber, Door Dash orders. We visited back in January the week Franekensons went viral, around that time I wasn't able to check in or post photos on Yelp. This is a belated review. I am not sure what the updates are, on wait and if he is taking on-line orders.? The line was super long, we waited 2 hours plus an additional 35 mins for our food. We got to meet Frank who walked by to greet and thank everyone. I kind of get the name of his business ""Frankenson =Frank and sons as his sons were also helping run the business.  While in line we met and talked to some nice locals and visitors, talking about food, of course! Our orders for today was the garlic knots, 12 wings in peach pineapple habanero & lemon pepper sauce, and Large pizza 5-0 combo. I went with the 2 flavors that Keith Lee reviewed. Luckily garlic knots were available still. Note, if you pay cash there is a small discount, my total was $70.98,  would have been $68.25 cash, here at Sin City I am saving my cash for the casino so I charged it. We were so excited and hungry when we got our orders, we had to take some quick photos, and time to attack!  The final verdict, Omg, loved lemon pepper and pepper/peach habanero wings, were legit good and the garlic knots, yums! The pizza was great but not the best!  I love that the food came out hot & fresh. My other half and son enjoyed it. They actually was patient and understanding on the wait. Overall, I would come back here for more wings, garlic knots, yes. pizza too! Oh and desserts, I remember seeing they have a monster size sundae.",0.9382

30-Mar-23,"It looks like since they have blown up on tik tok, food has gone down hill. Frank needs to get on his customer service recovery quick if he plans on staying open after this hype dies down. We ordered over the phone, the Garlic knots and lemon pepper wings. 1st issue, on the website it says the Garlic knots are $3.99 and 12 chicken wings are $12.99. We ended with a total of $30 somehow for these two items.When we picked up our order my car smelled of lovely garlic so we were excited to get home and try these items. The garlic knots were great, lots of great flavor. Now the real issue, these chicken wings looked like I had ordered from KFC. They were heavily breaded, soggy and wow LEMON flavor.The wings are not what is photographed on their website or their social media, they are using a different type of wing now and it is TERRIBLE, I have ordered better wings from Little Caesars. ( they look crispy in the photo but when you bite into them they were sooo soggy ) Frank, I hope you start reading and responding to these reviews and do some recovery on your customers to get them back in your shop, you going on tik tok welcoming people in now that you have slowed down is why we decided to pick up an order and I am disappointed we did.",0.9362
29-Mar-23,Called and someone answered immediately . The owner was here and he greeted everyone exceptional service. But ok the food. Oh my the food!!! I have never eaten garlic knots like this ever I don't know if I will find a match for that. The peach haberno chicken was so good it smelled so good and taste sorry Keith Lee it was a 10 out of 10 for me. The lemon pepper is more for people who like a citrus salty sour flavor because I have a sweet taste but the peach was my thing sooo good.

We ordered lemon pepper chicken and a small pizza, both of them were awful we threw them away at the end . The lemon pepper chicken was sour as f and the skin is too soft (not crunchy at all I don't know how to make a fried chicken shitty like that, it's just like soaked in the water for 24 hours long).

(Naturally asking before just a month ago you had to wait over 2 hours for a pizza) she answered blandly and annoyed ""20-25 minutes.."" i replied ""oh okay.."" as i was about to order a pizza she quickly responded ""YUP"" with an attitude, i couldnt bring my self to spend money and make a drive after ordering from someone that made me feel like im bugging them.

When we came in there was one girl there that was helpful and explained a couple things to us. We decided to get wings, so we ordered an order of 12 split in half, half lemon pepper, half mild. When we opened the lemon pepper, honestly we were disappointed. Right off the jump they looked soggy and nothing like the pictures we've seen, in fact, they weren't even hot! Which is really strange considering our other wings were obviously fresh and had a great crisp to them, even being covered in sauce. The lemon pepper wings we got were inedible, so wet and soggy and luke warm that we could not stomach them, while the mild ones were good. All in all, we were pretty disappointed, and sad to leave a small business like this a 2 star, but based on our experience tonight we won't be back.",0.4562

25-Mar-23,My adult son and I stopped in Friday to try out Frankensons Pizza after watching the review on Tik Toc and the news. A friendly young lady waited on me. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza. The cost was $32.00. I asked her if they could double slice it from eight to sixteen. She said they could. The wait was about 20 minutes from the time my pizza was made and baked. Not bad. It's a neat restaurant. I loved the scent of fresh baked pizza and wings wafting through the air. The employees are friendly and helpful. IThe restaurant has seating if you want to dine in and an outdoor seating area.I brought the pizza home and my family and I indulged ourselves. The sauce is light and flavorful. The cheese and pepperonis ample. One slice filled my tummy as the pizza is enormous-you get what you paid for. We will definitely return. I recommend trying them.

23-Mar-23,Visited Las Vegas and had to stop here after seeing it all over Tiktok. There was a bit of a wait but I didn't mind since I know it's a hot spot at the moment. The kitchen is open so you can see everything the cooks are doing. And if that's the situation then please be mindful of customers watching. I saw workers handling food without gloves and was immediately turned off. The lady making the wings would touch the wet rag then touch the chicken without even washing her hands. Ughh that made me want to leave.The food was okay. I ordered a pepperoni pizza wings and garlic knots. The pizza was nothing special. I've had way better. The garlic knots were the best thing to me. So much flavor and so soft. The wings didn't really hit. I really wanted this to be great after all the hype but it's lacking flavor and cleanliness.,0.9616
22-Mar-23,"First thing first, I was so excited to try this place after hearing Keith Lee's review. I love pizza and moving from San Francisco I been on the hunt for good Pizza. And this is, without a doubt, the worst pizza I have had in Las Vegas. This would not cut it in San Francisco. The Pizza ingredients are not good quality in my opinion. I reheated this in my oven and Costco Pizza reheats better which tells you how bad this reheats. This was one of the few times that i threw away my left overs because I couldn't bare to stomach the rest. The ranch is also bad, way to much dill and it tasted awful. The only thing Keith Lee was right about is the Wings, the wings are huge and tasty and the only thing worth giving a trying. Please note, I came here over a month ago but Yelp wouldn't let me leave a review. The pizza is that bad, that I felt compelled to leave this review. Don't fall victim to the hype.",0.7771
21-Mar-23,"Decided to try this place because of all the attention it has received. Not a good experience. The restaurant itself looks unkept. Both inside and out. There were pizza boxes stacked up on a table where people could've sitting. Literally everything needed to be wiped down. Including the shaker of garlic powder on the table which had food crusted all over it. On the table where they were prepping food they were so many bowls laying out with food in them. It made me wonder about proper food temps. But we stayed even though it looked messy inside, because we had seen great reviews. We waited a long time for our pizza because ""they had a big order"" ahead of us. Then even longer for the zucchini. When the pizza finally came out in a box even though we were eating there it looked like someone had tipped it sideways. All the sauce and cheese smeared to one side. Again we chose to overlook thThe pizza was soggy and wet on the bottom. Super disappointing since it had good flavor. Beware the ""zucchini planks"" are NOT fried zucchini. They look sautéed. When I approached the owner to ask about it. He argued with me saying they are ""fried"". He then abruptly asked me where my ""ticket"" was and said get your ""ticket"". Then refunded my money but clearly was not happy. Also the ranch is horrible. It has chopped dill in it which is fine but the amount is way way off. See photo. I wasn't even sure it was ranch-I had to ask. You can only taste the chopped dill. When I asked I was it is their own recipe. Super disappointed.",-0.5577

19-Mar-23,"Hands down the best pizza in Las Vegas. I got here just as they opened and was first in line. The inside was awesome with a great mural of the logo. There are plenty of seats if you can get there before everyone else. I managed to secure one table!The servers were outstanding! So lovely to speak with and they were all so happy to work there. Frank runs a great business.I got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza and Summers Chicken Sub. For the pizza it was $19 for a small...but a small is actually 14"", so is basically a large (comes in 8 slices). I saw the chicken being freshly made to order which was awesome. They hand fried two whole breasts and tossed in buffalo sauce before adding to the pizza. Now this pizza was special. The dough had a lightness and a delightful chew. There was a lot of cheese that was perfectly melted. The buffalo sauce base was spicy but not overpowering and the chicken was moist. A faultless pizza. I ate the entire thing with ease.I shared the sun with my friend. This was a bit of a downer to be honest. It seemed like a take on a bahn-mi with chicken, slaw (it was actually a lot of pickled vegetables), cilantro, pineapple, grilled onion, roasted peppers and teriyaki sauce. The sauce soaked into the bread which made it soggy. It was overly sweet for me - sweet sauce, sweet marinated chicken, sweet onions. The onions were grilled to the point of being jammy which would have been great, had there not been so much sweetness. Also, there was a lack of texture as everything was a bit too soft. It needed more slaw and less sauce. Overall, the pizza was epic, the sandwich not so much. I need to try their wings next time but I was stuffed!",0.9978
19-Mar-23,"Incredible experience! I ordered a pick up order a head of arriving. Service both over the phone and in person was great! Frank made sure to greet me as he was walking by. Great vibes!We tried multiple items, all of which were very well crafted and full of flavor! I loved the famous lemon pepper wings (we got them as fingers.) Amazing texture and flavor accompanied with. Homemade ranch that you could drink it's so good. My favorite item was the sausage and pepperoni Stromboli. The quality of meats really shined. Perfectly proportioned with peppers and cheese with an amazing flavorful crust. The side of marinara to dip is so well done. We will definitely be back!",0.9925

So we drive 15 minutes down there, and there's a small line of four people in front of me. Well, twenty minutes later and I'm still in line as well as the other four people. I asked the guy ahead of me how long he had been waiting to even order, and he said close to a half hour.   I'm not even sure they noticed our presence because literally nobody said a word to us. I'm only giving it two stars to give them the benefit of the doubt and am Definitely willing to give you guys another shot, but I think if they want to continue successfully, perhaps streamline a bit better or add personnel.",0.9465
18-Mar-23,"Busy. Busy. Busy. Tik tok definitely blew this place up. The food honestly was alright. We didn't try the pizza, however we got garlic knots, lemon pepper wings, mango habanero chicken strips, and an Italian sub. Lemon pepper wings weren't very crispy. I couldn't taste the lemon until the next day when I ate them. The flavor on the mango habanero chicken was bold but chicken was alright. The Italian sub was my favorite. It was amazing. It had a lot of meat and fresh veggies. Took forever to get our food cause of how busy it was. Napkins were out then refilled halfway through our meal. The garbage was full and the soda machine ran out of fruit punch about 40 min of us dining in. The garlic knots were bursting with flavor but hard! The outside was very crunchy. We thought it came with marinara sauce since they didn't give us any, but they were behind and got us marinara by the time we were done we were almost ready to leave.",0.9698
18-Mar-23,"Came from tiktok and although I don't live in Vegas I was visiting and I wanted to try them out, got the knots and Margarita pizza and lemon pepper wings. CS was friendly when I made the order over the phone. However, from pictures the knots were small not huge like the ones I received. The ranch was bitter so couldn't even eat them with it. I was excited to try but yeah I'm disappointed for sure",0.119
18-Mar-23,"Upon arrival, the restaurant is full of people. The interior has some tables for in restaurant eating. Service was friendly and they even figured out how to help us split our check. However, you need to be prepared to wait for your food or preorder currently (late February 2023). In terms of pricing, the garlic knots and shakes were pretty on par with what I saw but the pizza was a bit higher in price. For food, we ordered a medium meat lovers pizza, 6 order of garlic knots and 2 of their shakes. For the pizza, the overall taste of the dough was nice but it was more crunchy on the bottom while soft and doughy on top. It was certainly cheesy and the homemade meatballs were a star on there. I'd be interested to come back and try a pizza with just those meatballs as it was difficult due to the richness of the toppings and the the amount of cheese on there. I'd over all give it like a 6 out of 10. The combination of everything on the pizza made it quite filling that I could only eat one slice. Their garlic knots are huge and incorporate minced garlic and chili flakes, which is unique. The garlic knot dough for me was like an 8 out of 10 but I wanted a bit more roasted garlic flavor in the knots but loved the chili flake addition for a 6 out of 10 rating there. The marinara included was tasty but quite onion forward in flavor and I would have preferred for it to be warm, which would have been a better compliment to the garlic knots. Our shakes were tasty but quite thick in some parts. I got the Oreo and my friend got the chocolate peanut butter. Our cashier had added whip to it and he had indicated when we ordered no whip, she graciously made another one and apologized for the mistake. While this is not my personal favorite pizza place here in Vegas, I think it is definitely worth checking out but remember you eyes are probably bigger than your stomach and it is totally okay to share.",0.9964
18-Mar-23,"I decided to visit this restaurant based on the Keith Lee Tiktok review.My first visit was during the weekday. I ordered the garlic knots and rigatoni.

The owner was also working at the time.My friend and I decided to try this place again on a Friday night. We called in an order to pick up and take home. Ordered the garlic knots, the meatballs and an extra large pizza. The meatballs were the best part of the order. As for the garlic knots, my friend bit into one and it was so saturated with butter that it squirted out like a cherry tomato. The rest of them tasted as if there was no butter at all. The pizza we ordered had 4 toppings and we were charged $35 total foe the pizza. There was very little of any of the toppings or sauce or cheese to warrant that price. To top it off, the bottom was burnt. We each had a slice and threw out the rest. We were very disappointed. The owner was not present at the time.For a restaurant that received rave reviews, even by myself the first visit, it seems like the quality control is not managed properly when the owner is not in store. The pictures I took were from my first visit. No pictures from the 2nd.",0.9653
16-Mar-23,"Heard about the amazing wings, and had been meaning to try them for awhile. We ordered a Margherita Pizza and the lemon pepper wings for lunch. In a nutshell we were very disappointed. The wings were soaking wet with grease (maybe because the fryer oil was old?) and it was pretty obvious that the Margherita pizza we ordered was a normal pizza with some yellow ricotta cheese and a few slices of mozzarella. I will say we enjoyed the French fries, but paying 35 dollars for the enjoyment of a few fries isn't the experience we were expecting. Hard to say if we would even hazard another attempt at trying Frankenson's again.  For context , we were so disappointed about the food that we had originally tried to post this review about a month ago when we had ordered and attempted to eat it - but at the time yelp had paused reviews due to an upsurge of activity - and I am still so upset about the food that I was content to wait this long until I could actually post this review.",-0.3368
15-Mar-23,"Went in and ordered wasn't able to get through on the phone, understandable with all the popularity. Ordered a sub small pizza and 6wings came out to around $50 sub was really good, wasn't expecting any kick but glad they put in the pepperoncinis or banana peppers in it, added a nice touch. They did ask if we wanted the bread toasted or not we chose no, but depending on how far you have to go say yes, part of the bottom bread was to soggy to hold on to, but really enjoyable non the less. Pizza was good decent amount of pepperonis and jalapeños and the wings were the best out of any pizza place my girlfriend and I have visited. They do them real justice, got buffalo on the side and the lemon pepper, because didn't think my dad could have them. The wing dry was seasoned and crispy. The place was nice and cozy, we drove by it the first time not knowing it, frank the owner was nice and personable, employees were friendly. Working those long hours and still being nice when getting off  definitely would go back.",0.9955
15-Mar-23,Pretty good food for our neighborhood but the pricing on a couple things is a bit to high to make it our weekly stop.,0.0644
14-Mar-23,"This place is really delicious.  My family of 4 went in today and we ordered a large half pep half cheese and the 12 count wings with fries.  We got half hot and half zesty BBQ.  I thought it was going to be like a spicy BBQ, but instead it was a mustardy BBQ which was really, really good.  I'd go back just for the wings.  The pizza was huge and super greasy.  Not a big deal, we just used napkins to sop it up and we were good to good.  We all ate till we could barely move and still had pizza and wings to go.  For the price we paid I was more than satisfied and I will be back.",0.9859
