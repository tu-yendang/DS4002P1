20-Sep-24,Don't walk RUN!!!  If you love great good please go. The service was great. Nice atmosphere. They had music playing which I'm glad wasn't loud like most restaurants. Now to the food. I had the neem egg roll. OMG it was so good. My entrée was the red snapper and jollof rice. If the cook would've came from the back just know he would've got slap cause everything was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  The price and portions matched.  This place should be packed based on food alone.  The restaurant will definitely be added to one of my favorites in Vegas. I have read the negative reviews and just because a certain type of cuisine isn't your thing that shouldn't be your reason for a low rating. Just my personal opinion.,0.9848
17-Sep-24,"Absolutely outstanding service by Hawa and Ole. The fresh grilled snapper with the confit, jollof rice and sauce was amazing. The tender fall off the bone oxtail was amazing as well. The gravy was outstanding with the white rice. The plantains and meat filled patties were also outstanding. The pineapple ginger drinks were amazing. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you for the amazing experience. Take care",0.9913
15-Sep-24,Wow thank you to the whole team this is the best African kitchen in AMERICA thank you Nene for an incredible experience. The food and palm wine will blow your mind. We cannot wait to come back. Highly recommended Lola P,0.9336
14-Sep-24,"I highly recommend Calabash African Kitchen for flavorful food! If you're looking for good service, this may not be the best option. You will have to be prepared to wait for your food order. It is a long wait, probably 45 minutes to 1 hour after your order is placed. The food is 100% worth the wait! I ordered the Red Stew with Jollof Rice - both were fresh and packed with FLAVOR!! I'll be back to try more dishes but I may order for pick up instead.",0.6576
12-Sep-24,"The two ladies who greeted us when we walked in were incredibly warm and welcoming and the dining room was clean and open. The table and chairs were comfortable. Music was a little loud. Our server kindly offered to bring me a taster of the baobab milk drink when I asked what it was...it was tasty so I promptly ordered a glass! Sort of like horchata in terms of consistency, flavor profile was sweet and slightly fruity. She also brought out tasters of various stews of theirs to help inform/guide us on our menu selections. I had the okra stew with a side of jollof rice and we ordered the appetizer sampler as well. From the sampler: the plantains were sooo delicious...perfectly caramelized and soft but not mushy, the empanadas were tasty, and the fried black eyed pea balls were scrumptious. The okra stew was also delicious...rich, thick and full of flavor. The jollof rice was a tasty surprise as well. It was a little smoky for my taste but that's probably just a personal preference and I don't hold it as a negative toward the restaurant...I imagine that's just the nature of the dish. It also didn't stop me from woofing down quite a bit of it with some of the oxtail soup broth ladeled over it....dee-lish!",0.9571
12-Sep-24,The food was amazing and flavorful. Me and my boyfriend enjoyed everything from the welcoming environment to the fresh food. Terrence made sure we were taken care of. This was an amazing first experience and we will definitely be back again.,0.9729
8-Sep-24,"I went to Calabash on Friday evening and it was my first time . I enjoyed the ox tails, and I love the ginger drink.. I loved the live music and the people were very nice and very friendly. I cannot wait to go back to see with friends and family..",0.9686
7-Sep-24,Love love love !!! The food was amazing. The service was on point. The music was the vibe. So happy we found this place. The food was not very pricey and worth every penny. Environment was clean and comfortable.,0.9841
6-Sep-24,"What an amazing restaurant this is. A delight for your mouth and senses. Walking in it felt like an oasis with soft afrobeats and a spacious layout. Calm. Smelled great. Nice greeting and seated promptly. The menu is full of things I have only ever read about in West African Speculative Fiction. Egusi Soup, Jollof of Rice, Goat Pepper Soup & Peanut butter soup come to mind. I was also looking for a grilled fish and they have Grilled Snapper! We got  the snapper, egusi, red stew and sides. Each felt so complete, seasoned and just tasted like this chef cooks everything beautifully-Any cuisine I believe. The textures the heat- allOf it was delicious! The snappers smokiness was perfectly balanced with the delicate onion confit & the tomato/onion/cucumber garnish reminded me of Pico De Gallo...such an amazing combo. The calabash spice really popped too. I also learned that Baobab Juice ""Bouye"" exists! It tastes great-not quite like anything I have had. As if the Baobab tree weren't awesome enough! They make a few other nice juices, I really liked the pineapple ginger. Our server, the only server there, served the whole dining room with grace and generosity often handing out samples first to be sure you liked it-Class act. So thrilled to have found such a tasty place!",0.9953
6-Sep-24,Amazing place and the food was delicious. Nene our server was delightful thanks for everything.,0.9349
30-Aug-24,"My favorite African cuisine in Las Vegas! I tried the fufu, oxtail stew, egusi and jollof rice. If you like a little kick it's there! Must try.",0.7256
28-Aug-24,"Ordered empanadas, chicken peanut butter stew, chicken chu, beef jolof,Empanadas were really flavorful with a nice fresh red sauce.Chicken peanut butter stew and chu was probably some of the best braised chicken dishes I ever had. The chicken was grilled and heavily seasoned which formed a flavorful crunchy crust, which I've never tasted on a braised chicken dish. Excellent.Beef jolof was delicious as well although i could possibly like it better if it was with the chicken. I'd be curious to come back and try the goat or ox tail versions of the dishes. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.",0.9768
23-Aug-24,It's my second time trying the food and both times have been amazing from the food to the service.Nene was our server on Wednesday and she was so sweet and attentive as well as the rest of the staffAll the food has great flavors and can't wait to go again and try something new,0.9308
22-Aug-24,"I saw this place on TikTok and had to try it while I was in town. The food was amazing, and so was the service. Nene went above and beyond to serve us. She gave us samples to try, which was really helpful. I recommend the Fataya pies, oxtail stew, egusi soup, and the red stew. They were all delicious! I would definitely come back here if I'm in Vegas again.",0.9465
21-Aug-24,"My 13 year old was dying to try Fufu so we found this place on google maps. We ordered the Oxtail, the Fried Plantains, and the Empanadas. The Empanadas were the perfect flakiness and their sauce had a not too overwhelming kick to it. The Plantains had the perfect sweetness to them and were not over fried, and the Oxtail was very juicy and succulent. I'm still not sure if I'm sold on Fufu because it was a little too starchy for me personally but this place is hands down an amazing spot to sample some of the best West African recipes. The staff was courteous and extremely helpful with the ordering process.",0.9797
18-Aug-24,"This place is great!  The flavors are amazing and the menu has so many great choices.  Our server, Terrance, helped us navigate what to have ...this time we had oxtail stew and cassava leaf stew ... jollof rice and fufu.   It's so hard to describe how delicious everything is!   Try it, you'll love it!!!  A great family run restaurant!!!",0.9783
18-Aug-24,Food is amazing and the ambience is great. The service is fantastic. My favorite dish is the Oxtail with white rice.,0.9382
15-Aug-24,"Great ambiance, super clean, very welcoming and homely. The food is absolutely delicious.. get the pineapple ginger drink and thank me later.",0.9468
11-Aug-24,"I have been here several times and each time I come it's always amazing. Thank you guys I always have the best experience whether I'm with friends or or dining alone. Service is always great and they are very friendly makes me feel very comfortable, the music is great and so are the drinks food is amazing alway hot fresh and flavorful .. thank you!! See yall soon",0.9891
10-Aug-24,"This is one of my absolute favorite places to eat. If you're looking for a nice comfort food, this is the place to go. I normally get the oxtail soup with fufu. The oxtail falls off of the bone, sooo tender!! I have dined in and ordered delivery and the food is just as good even when it's delivered. The owner is such a beautiful soul.. she puts her all into her cooking and you can absolutely tell. She even comes out to talk to you and ask how everything is when dining in, Shes a true queen!! Come in, sit down, enjoy the yummy food and great atmosphere!!",0.9831
9-Aug-24,"Flavor BOMB! Delectable Spices galore!!I loooovvvee finding hidden gems like this. This was also my first time trying West African food.. According to the their website, this is African Fusion cuisine:""West African restaurant serving Jollof inspired Senegambian cuisine. Where Senegalese Restaurant meets Gambian Food. ""- A good size venue with a bar in the front. The ambiance was chic, yet relaxing. Nothing pretentious about this place. Staff were friendly and very helpful. In fact, the lady who was assisting us brought out a sample of several sauces to try, so we could get an idea of what the dishes tasted like...Mahalo! Parking is not an issue with plenty of spaces available in the shopping plaza.I got no clue what Senegalese or Gambian food tastes like on it's own. Either way, the food here was delish!! Everything we had was packed with flavor and oh so scrumptious...#AfricanFusion:~ FRIED PLANTAINS - 4/5A small appetizer. Just your run of the mill Fried Plantains. Very edible, nothing special.~ HIBISCUS JUICE ""Bissap Wonjo"" - 3.5/5Nothing amazing about this one. This was delicate and refreshing with a mild Hibiscus flavor. I had much better Hibiscus Juice before. ~ OKRA STEW ""Soup Kanja"" w/Lamb - 4.5/5We had to be taught on how to eat this. Take the round ball (bread) that is presented to you, flatten it with your hands and enjoy with the Stew...basically making a small taco. Tender pieces of Lamb bursting with flavor... brilliant!~ RED STEW ""Chu"" w/ Goat - 5/5It doesn't look like much. But the Stew was AMAZING!! So flavorful, without being overly Spicy. The Goat was  so tender, it just fell apart. Don't sleep on this place. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!",0.9764
9-Aug-24,"Amazing! My new favorite spot. Dont be afraid to come and ask for suggestions if you are new to West African cuisine; the whole staff is so friendly. My order was goat chu with fufu. There is oil and there are bones; it is all flavor baby! The flavor is amaazin. The owner (more importantly the chef) came out to greet everyone as time allowed. She is a very sweet soul. It comes out in her food. Authentic food and music made me feel a million miles away, which is exactly what i needed on a Friday. I will be back soon!",0.9622
9-Aug-24,"This is my second visit to Calabash African Kitchen, and my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My husband and I shared the grilled meat- chicken and lamb with a portion of Jollof Rice. The meal was excellent, with the right amount of spice. My friends shared the goat and fufu. They, too, only had good things to say about their meal. The service was excellent. Our server was attentive and helpful. The owner also came out to chat with us and ensure everything was to our liking. I can't wait to return.",0.9848
7-Aug-24,"Have been wanting to try African food, and this place is IT! From the cleanliness of the restaurant to customer service, you can't go wrong. All the employees offered excellent customer service and very hospitable. Ordered the chicken empanadas, grill meat platter, oxtail w/ fufu, chicken wings and jollof rice. DELICIOUS! Definitely returning.",0.9322
7-Aug-24,"I will tell you, this is my first time ever trying any African Cuisine Im glad my wife and I tried it! I only put in the order thru yelp and picked it up. Service was still great and the inside was elegant and simple touch with a bar as well.  We ordered the Oxtail Stew, Peanut Butter Stew with Goat and side of Plantains. Every thing was so yummy. The oxtail was cooked so well the meat fell off the bone when I picked it up. The peanut butter stew being Filipino comparing it to Kare Kare. You really can't compare both of them. They both taste delicious in their own ways. It wasnt Kare Kare BUT it was so delish that there was no such thing as a leftover lolThe price may seem slightly expensive but you really get the portion you pay for. You're not screwed with the price/ portion ratio. If you've never had any African Cuisine ever in your life give them a try! This is coming from an Asian guy.",0.9073
5-Aug-24,"There is no reason to not give 5 stars. They are very busy for dinner hours but obviously because of social media marketing and word  of mouth this place  is packed. I went on a Sunday for my Anniversary- luckily we got seated quick because we were a party of two. My server was Andrea. She made sure we had samples of the juices before ordering and was patient enough to explain our options. I got the oxtail stew which was 10/10 - because it tasted like a traditional dish. My husband got lamb chops-!I was trying not to eat his because they were so good and grilled fresh! The entire staff was great, the price was as expected, above your normal  bar dinner roughly $30 per entree. The music was a vibe and the restrooms were clean. The crowd of patrons was surprisingly diverse- that says a lot !!! The food was cooked from scratch with Love. I will definitely come again , perhaps for lunch. For reference- my bill was $118.00",0.9933
5-Aug-24,"Foodie paradise of amazing food!! Full of spices and flavors. I love pretty much every dish we've tried!! Unfortunately, it takes 40min to get your food :/ I understand why there's so many takeouts. We may do that next time. Even if I could enjoy alcoholic drinks for 40min, there isn't enough staff to take the order, make it, and bring it over :/ Staff are very sweet and will apologize. It's not them, maybe just not enough staff for both front of the house and kitchen? 2nd time here (visited with kids/teens) and we ordered -- - Cassava Leaf Stew ""Palasas"" $19 +5 lamb, side of fufu. Definitely taste like alot of veggies. The lamb was okay. Maybe beef or something else would be better? - Peanut butter stew ""made/domodo"" $19 +$3 chicken, side of Jollof Rice. Chicken was great. But have interest in trying lamb or a boneless protein instead. - Shawarma $14 +2 Beef with salad instead of fries. This dish was for a sensitive kid, who is very particular with food. Someone I believe likes more American old diner/comfort food and doesn't do well with spices, flavorful or ethnic food, etc. He didn't like anything else we ordered, as expected. - Fried Plantains $7, appetizer size. Never can go wrong. Our favorite, and the foodie kid's favorite out of all these dishes. She like all the dishes in general too but when asked which is number 1, she said the fried plantains.- Hibiscus Juice $6. Pretty sweet, but they can't customize the sweetness in it. So as we drink it, we add ice water to the mix.Everyone has their own taste. And I'm a newbie to West African regional dishes, so take everything with a grain of salt. We love every dish so far. But if we had to rank our top favorites/not by mood, below are things we would recommend -- Sides and Appetizers: - #1 must choice is fried Plantains appetizer size $7. Everyone always loves it. - Fufu and Jollof Rice are staples you have to get as a side. Super flavorful Jollof RicesEntree: - Grilled Meat 'Dibi Afra/Suy"", lamb is amazing. It's something we'd recommend as the #1 non-stew entree. - Peanut Butter Stew is very easy to get addicted to. To try next time: Lamb chops was sold out during our 1st visit. Okra StewOxtailSoooo much more to try on the menu!!",0.998
31-Jul-24,"Walking into Calabash the decor, music, and staff were perfect for an off strip dinner.  Our server was NeNe-- she was so sweet and personable.  NeNe had great recommendations for the kids and adults. The food presentation was beautiful and so flavorful.  Thank you Calabash African House, we'll be back.",0.9604
31-Jul-24,"Date of Visit:July 31, 2024, I visited this restaurant based on the numerous positive reviews, but unfortunately, my experience was extremely disappointing. Despite the claims that this place is welcoming, I found the staff to be inattentive and unresponsive. They did not check in on me during my meal, and it felt like they were doing everything but their job.The food was served to me cold, which is a significant concern, especially from a health and safety perspective. The environment was not friendly, contrary to what other reviews have suggested. The ambiance was lacking, and I felt completely ignored throughout my visit.I would like to address my concerns with management, but I doubt they will take my feedback seriously. I have already emailed them regarding my experience and requested a refund for my meal due to the poor quality. If I do not receive a response, I will have no choice but to escalate my complaint to the health department.This was an unfortunate experience, and I hope others do not encounter the same issues I did. Sincerely,Denisha J",-0.9066
29-Jul-24,Omfg I looooove fufu and honestly fufu is hard to find in Vegas and in California so when I was in Vegas and saw there was a spot for it I immediately went ! And I was not disappointed!  Taste is on point heaven in my mouth ! I got the oxtail and it was sooo tender ! Good came out piping hot and I couldn't Wait so I burned my mouth but it was worth it . We also got goat pepper that was yummy too Empanadas nice and crispy dough was similar to Colombian empanadas Staff was so friendly I think they liked that we liked their food they like to crack jokes too it was a vibe They have super loud music playing  some nice Afro beats I wanted to dance hahaha The inside is sooo aesthetic and pretty ! I felt fancy ! Deff my new go to every time I make a Vegas trip,0.9957
28-Jul-24,"Customer service is EVERYTHING coming to a table not introducing yourself to take someone's order, having food brought to the table that rolls of the plate because the person didn't care, rolled her eyes at changing the food choice. The atmosphere was the only saving grace in my opinion. My self personally I would come to the table introduce myself as __________ I'm your waiter today, have you been here before. Bathrooms are this way. Our menu favorite is __________ did you have anything in mind that you wanted... etc something of that nature. The vibe of the host was very stale as was her service. I wouldn't go back honestly. I'm very big on customer service. The food was amazing though. And one of the other servers seems extremely welcoming and Nice I loved her personality",0.9398
27-Jul-24,"I got the Senegalese eggs rolls ""neem"" and oxtail soup and both were absolutely delicious! I want a whole gallon of the pineapple ginger juice to go! Everyone was so kind and welcoming which made it feel like home. The atmosphere was so calm. The art and music was a whole vibe. Definitely coming back soon.",0.9677
26-Jul-24,I must say waiting an hour and a half for food was crazy! We ordered one dish the egusi with fufu. It was ok nothing special. The fufu had an after taste could def do without but the egusi soup was decent. Would we try again maybe not the portion was way too small for the cost and it was vegan.,-0.2549
26-Jul-24,The Oxtail soup was everything.   Outstanding flavor.  The service team was awesome.  They let us sample things before ordering.  The beef and chicken pies were also really good.  Finally tried Egusi Soup.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Will come back again.,0.9392
24-Jul-24,"Everything was amazing!! I went with my partner, both of our first time. The server asked if we had been before and I said no and asked for recommendations, instead he said I'll bring out samples to help you decide. I ended up ordering the chu and it was phenomenal! My partner ordered the oxtail which was so rich and flavorful. We also got an appetizer of the black eyed pea fritters that had the perfect crisp outside and fluffy middle. They had music videos on and a great vibe. Highly recommend!!",0.9708
23-Jul-24,"My family was visiting Las Vegas and we decided on trying African cuisine for the first time and boy, were we impressed with Calabash African Kitchen.  We ordered the fried fish, peanut butter stew and oxtail stew; everything tasted so flavorful. The staff was very friendly and attentive, I highly recommend rather visiting or residing in Las Vegas you visit this restaurant.",0.855
14-Jul-24,The quality of the food is consistent across the board. It's always amazing! The service from all of the workers is amazing. Everyone is always kind and always making sure all of their customers are taken care of. Always a good time coming to this restaurant.,0.9622
13-Jul-24,So I have been here 3 times within the last month. The first time it was my first time tasting African Food and my mind was blown the food was so delicious. I have been craving Calabash since the first visit and I find myself keep going back. All the food is so flavorful. The whole fried snapper is my favorite entree and the oxtail is delicious also. The jollof rice has a smoky taste and is bursting with flavor. The drinks are also delicious we loved the hibiscus drink and the pineapple ginger. All the staff here is amazing and very knowledgeable of the menu and the ingredients and spices that are used.Located in a shopping center with plenty of parking. They also have happy hour specials available. Definitely give Calabash if you haven't already.,0.9865
12-Jul-24,I tried the mafe with chicken and the beef and chicken empandas.  The flavors are amazing.  I only wish they gave me more sauce with the mafe and a little more chicken for the expensive price. The service was good and staff was very friendly.  The ambiance is colorful and music fills the atmosphere.  The music is a little loud with the Tvs for conversation but nice. They have a nice little bar and I tried there version of a long Island. It was a little sweet but tasty. If you are on a budget this place is not for you. But I think everyone should try at least one time to try these amazing flavors of different parts of Africa.,0.9739
11-Jul-24,"It's worth the trip! I am West African and a foodie so I will try anything once . The Senegalese/Gambian fusion is a hit for me and I'll be back...I had the okra stew with fufu and hubby had jollof rice with stew. Both were a HIT oh! I appreciated the samples prior to us ordering because the spices and blend of some traditional west African dishes were different (not bad but different) than what I am used to. The jollof rice was VERY tasty. I won't start the war here on Yelp about who has the best jollof, but eh Senegal maybe giving Nigeria a run for their naira. The okra was also made differently than what I am used to but VERY tasty. If you are used to the ""slime"" of traditional okra soup, you won't have it in this dish. The flavors were flavoring with this dish as well. I ate my stew with fufu. If was the right size for me, but not enough o finish the stew. I ate most of the stew by itself which I am not complaining about. We both ordered hibiscus tea for our meals. If you've ever had Jamaica Sorrel, it's similar but again different. The juice was sweet with a kick of sour. I would try the other juices for our next visit. That pineapple ginger sounded good as well. The restaurant is also super cute! I loved all the art, murals and their playlist was a nice background music that set good vibes. Our server Andrea (I think)  was also very knowledgeable about the food, spices, drinks, all the things on the menu and was very helpful. Final note: African food is not fast. Yes you are in a restaurant but please don't expect the food to come immediately after you've ordered. We waited some 10-15 or 20 minutes for our food. It's well worth the wait and didn't order appetizers. Overall 10/10 for the food, service and ambiance. We going back for the jollof rice for sure and will try other dishes on the menu. Until next time...",0.9966
10-Jul-24,"Oh man, I've been here about 4 times already with my girlfriend and it never disappoints. Our server Nene, is always the sweetest and provides the best service everytime making sure we always leave satisfied. The oxtail soup, lamb chops, and the red stew was delicious. Always expect me coming back!",0.9357
7-Jul-24,"We arrived around 6:00pm on a Saturday.  I like how they have live music.  We were seated close to live music, but there's no bad seat in the house. The place had a good amount of people, but it wasn't extremely busy. Service was extremely slow though.  We ordered black eyed peas fritters with onion sauce, oxtail stew with fufu, and yassa with chicken and jollaf rice. I wasn't going to order the black eyed peas fritters because I knew our entrees were going to be plenty, but I'm glad I did!  The fritters were very soft and the inside was almost very soft muffin like.  Our server told us to not expect to see black eyed peas, but they are there, we just can't see it because it was blended and mashed.  One of my favorite appetizers and will definitely get again next time.  Oxtail stew with fufu has great flavor!  The oxtail stew was tender, but not completely fall off the bone tender.  I really like the flavor, but I think they could've used less salt next time.  I'm not sure what fufu is made of, but it appears and feels like a giant potato dumpling.  It went perfect with the oxtail stew! Overall this place is fantastic to go with friends.  The portions are great, and I enjoyed life entertainment; however, service was very slow and the oxtails just needed less salt.",0.9953
5-Jul-24,"This was my first experience having African food and Calabash was a great introduction.  Our waiter, Terrance, was extremely patient and explained everything in detail. To start we had Fried Plantains, Fataya-Pies, Neem, and the Akara. I would order everything again except the Akara. For the main entree, I had the Red Stew with Fufu. It was excellent!",0.8439
2-Jul-24,"Ordered dinner for pick on a Friday night and the wait time was longer than the 15-20 minutes estimated time we were given + they were pretty busy which says a lot about how good their food is. My first time trying African food and I will say, it's definitely an acquired taste. It wasn't my fave but it wasn't bad. Being my 1st time here, maybe I should've ordered something else or tried more things from the menu but it was already pretty pricey for what we did order IMO. I got the chicken egusi soup with a side of fufu and my sister got the fish egusi soup because she doesn't eat meat. The egusi soup was spicy - I like spicy but my kids don't so they didn't get to eat much of it. The empanadas were my fave out of everything we ordered. I'm definitely open to coming back and trying more from the menu. Next time I want to try the whole fish. Also- it probably tastes better fresh so maybe I gotta dine in next time too.",0.9726
28-Jun-24,"Went to this Restaurant for the first time it was absolutely amazing. The food was so delicious we had 4 people in our party we shared the ox tail,the lamb ,the chicken,And a few other dishes including the large appetizer platter everyone loved the food .The owner was an amazing woman.Very friendly and very hard working.Our waitress was very helpfull and friendly.The atmosphere was just wonderfull. I Recommend this place to anyone who is wanting to try something different.Oh the drinks was amazing.",0.9849
25-Jun-24,"It had to be a fluke right? There's no way a restaurant 4 minutes away from my home could be so good. There's no way that the service and food from my first time could be replicated right?My second time was just as amazing, this time Jewel was my server and I could not say anything but great things about her. I made sure to order something different this time, the oxtail stew. Wow. Wow. Wow. I really don't understand how they can make something so delicious with all the spices and ingredients that is available to everybody. Chef is in the back doing the lords work. I wasn't even that hungry and felt obligated to eat it all. When there was no food left I was tempted to eat the bowl the stew came in. 100 percent recommend this place to everybody.",0.9905
23-Jun-24,"This is a long overdue review. This was the first place I tried West African food, and I came here with a party of 16 from my work place. Let me first begin by saying that by the time it's 6pm, this place gets busy and the atmosphere comes alive with their musician. I tried the baobab juice, oxtail soup, and fufu. It was a great introduction for me. More than that, we also met one of the owners and she was very kind and sweet. Definitely recommend this place!",0.9676
23-Jun-24,I loved it! I have been wanting to try African food for quite a while now and I was not disappointed! Everything had was amazing! The only downfall was the music was too loud for me! However the customer service was GREAT! And the food was amazing,0.9685
23-Jun-24,Not even sure where to start here because it's all so amazing. This restaurant feels like you are invited into a family home and they are cooking dinner.. The care that goes into this food is next level and a must try.,0.8626
19-Jun-24,"It is definitely great to try different culture cuisines. However, the food did not suit my taste buds. I got the ox tail, red stew with beef, Jollof Rice , Fried Plantains, Ginger Pineapple Juice and Baobab Juice. All the food was heavily seasoned, on the saltier side and all spicy. One thing I've noticed is that all of their dishes have a hint of spicy. It's not crazy spicy or anything but just be aware. The meats were very well cooked in a good way. It easily shredded. The fried plantain was just average similar to cafeteria plantains. It also tasted a bit like potatoes.Ginger Pineapple Juice: very heavy ginger taste. Definitely hits the back of your throat a lot. Baobab juice: on the sweeter side. Very thick but delicious. I would've preferred if it was more liquid.Now let's talk about the service. This was where the issue for me was and why my review is only two stars. The service was extremely slow and unorganized. I spent a total of 90min in this restaurant and only about 10min was of actual eating. The rest was me waiting for the servers and trying to get their attention. I waited for about 40min for the food and one of my sides was forgotten. When I tried to get one of their attention, she said she'll be right back then went on to completely forget to come back. After finishing I spent the rest of the 90min trying to get the servers attention for a check. The servers were very nice people but they lacked communication between. After finally receiving the check from one server, another server came later with the check again and was confused that I already got my check. The restaurant is very well decorated and the vibes were definitely great. But the servers all seemed extremely stressed and overwhelmed. The restaurant was not full and with three servers available, as someone who've worked at restaurants before I thought it looked completely manageable. Management should work on improving the overall dining experience and figure out a way to make it more smooth. Overall the food was not for my personal taste but I still would recommend others to try it. Even though the servers were nice individuals, service was not it  and had long wait times.",0.9931
19-Jun-24,"Food: 5/5. Big fan of African food, but my first time here. I started with the fataya pies, which are basically empanadas with different fillings that align with the local ingredients & flavors (for this place, Senegal/Gambia). These appetizers were excellent -- crispy and not too oily, with a lot of good substance inside the shell. I liked the beef one more than the seafood one, but both were very good. For my main I had their signature rice jollof (excellent) and their oxtail stew (sublime -- their oxtail chunks are HUGE with fall-of-the-bone meat & stew seasoning is uniquely spiced and it's PHENOMENAL, like nothing I've had anywhere).  Bravo.Service: 5/5. I came in for lunch and it was empty, and my server Andrea was very friendly and knowledgeable in explaining all the dishes (it's apparent she 's done this often and the staff here is trained to be thorough in educating guests on the cuisine, which is great for first-timers).  Andrea brought out the food and was very attentive to my dining needs. Then as i ate the place filled up quickly and I observed how professional she was with the other diners, and when she came back to me she was very apologetic for the wait. About as good as service can get.Ambiance: 5/5. This is actually one of the nicest African restaurants I've ever been to in terms of wall decor and modern amenities, which was unexpected given that many of the African joints in Vegas are located in modest digs in older buildings (which makes their food no less yummy).  Their bar was well-lit and well-stocked, giving the appearance that this is a popular high-energy evening hangout spot for the neighborhood and the culture.  There were also  flatscreens playing catchy hip-hop afrobeats as I dined, enhancing the mood and contributing to the positive vibes.Nothing but superlatives to describe this place, and I can't wait to come back and try more of their menu.  Be forewarned that this place is a bit pricier than other African spots around Vegas, but it's similarly priced to nice African spots in L.A./NYC/D.C. and you actually get bigger portions (i.e. you'll likely have leftovers to serve as tomorrow's meal) than in those bigger cities. And as mentioned above, you are paying a little extra for a higher level of ambiance and service.  To all my fellow locals: I highly recommend this place for a date night, a pregame dinner with a friend before a weekend party night, or a small group dinner/drinks night if you have big-city friends in town who are the urbanite foodie type.  Kudos to the owner and management team for creating such a unique, authentic, entertaining and tasty restaurant concept -- it feels like it belongs on the Strip, but I'm so glad that it's off-strip and caters to the neighborhood rather than the tourist traffic.",0.9984
17-Jun-24,Yummy yummy packed with flavor from excellent seasoning and fermentation throughout the dishes.We have had this place earlier this year in the winter and have obviously returned. We were offered the soup and stew samplers and i knew what I was ordering on my third visit (the next day). The okra and Egusi were amazinggg.My boyfriend had the empanadas in which he crushed. I had the snapper and it was so well seasoned ugh i can still taste it. I opted for the Fried Red Snapper with the fermented grain side. So so good. The little tomato and onion side and the sauce is quite spicy but it goes with the grain and that tones it down. The fish had perfect crunch and temperature Customer service is always great. The chef came out to check on our enjoyment and if we were truly experiencing the dishes as they are meant to be. I appreciate learning opportunities when i am eating from cultures outside my own so 10/10.,0.9879
16-Jun-24,"Let me start by saying that I am upset that it took us so long to come here, and we have absolutely been missing out, until tonight. Walking in was like walking into a good friends cozy house. It's warm and inviting and so tastefully designed and decorated. Once we were settled at our table I felt like I could have stayed there all night. I'll get to the point of what you're reading this for. The food exceeded all of our expectations. I got the hibiscus tea which was lovely. We got the vegetarian empanadas and the black eyed pea fritters. SO GOOD. I got the ""bean stew"" with plantains and let me tell you, I need those plantains with every meal from now on. It was absolutely delicious, and then little side of onions that it came with was heavenly. My husband got the peanut butter stew with chicken and a side of jollof rice and he could not stop raving about it. The chicken was so tasty (on bone) and scooping it up with the side of fufu was an excellent choice. We got the chakri for dessert and it was a wonderful blend of textures and just the right amount of sweetness. Terrance was our server and I can't say enough nice things about him. He helped us with menu recommendations and took great care of us all evening. Everyone was so kind and it was such a lovely environment to be in. We already know what we want to try for our next visit.",0.9947
15-Jun-24,"Calabash is truly a remarkable African restaurant that offers a delightful combination of delectable cuisine,  outstanding service, and ambience . During my visit, I had the pleasure of trying various dishes from their menu, such as the flavorful jollof rice, the tasty Egusi soup, the succulent oxtail and perfectly fried tilapia. Each dish surpassed my expectations, as they were meticulously prepared and bursting with mouthwatering flavors. It's safe to say that Calabash is, without a doubt, the finest African restaurant I've had the pleasure of dining at.",0.9888
14-Jun-24,"Fam! i seent this place, yes ""seent"", this place on Instagram, and had to take my Mom here for Mother's day. When i say this food was so bomb, it's definitely an understatement! Calabash had me big smiling , showing ALL MY TEETH! Even the Molars!I've never in my life tasted ingredients so rich and flavorful! Had my taste buds dapping hands with my tongue doing the Cha-Cha Slide part 8,  in my mouth. Talking bout Chomp Chomp real smooth yall!Everybody was so welcoming, and we got to meet the owner too! She came out and chatted with us at the table for a bit. She was so nice! Such a sweetheart, and her story about how she opened Calabash is so interesting! First time trying Fufu! I got the lamb stew, and veggie Jollof with all the spices.  oooof.",0.9793
13-Jun-24,"I ordered Egusi with fish and fufu through door dash. The food arrived fast and was still warm and ready to enjoy. It was flavorful with a little spice to it. My 9 month old and I enjoyed the egusi and fish over the course of two days, I made white rice to go with it and it was delicious. I plan to go in person to get the full experience soon and to try other dishes on the menu.",0.9274
9-Jun-24,"We've always wanted to try this type of food. Let me tell you everything hit. Ambiance was very nice and relaxing, they even had live music from the time we went. Our Server Mo was very informational and all the dishes he recommended were excellent, definitely made our night for sure. Since we've never had African type food before he was able to answer any questions regarding food.Food was excellent we got the Sample Platter great variety of appetizers to try, The Meat Platter was small plate than we thought but don't be fooled it was piles of very succulent and grilled to order meat. Peanut butter stew was extremely savory and heavy but overall delicious and I forgot the last dish name.Definitely recommend coming here to give it a try. If this is what represents African food I'm extremely impressed by the flavors (P.S: Happy hour is I believe 3pm-6pm)",0.9874
8-Jun-24,"Finally tried Calabash African Kitchen after driving by so many times, and I will be back for more! Everything was amazing from the customer service, to the food, and the ambiance. And they have VEGAN options! Oregolele was our server and he was so amazing! He checked in on us regularly as did the other staff working other tables which was nice.  It was our first time experiencing SeneGambia African cuisine so he brought us a sampler of the Okra Stew (Soup Kanja), Red Stu (Chu), Peanut Butter Stew (Mafe Domoda), and the Egusu Soup. Each one was extremely delicious, fresh, and packed with flavor. The Egusu Soup had a delicious seafood flavor, and a nice spicy kick to it, the Peanut Butter Stew (Mafe Domoda) had a lighter flavor with spices that paired well together, the Red Stu (Chu) had a more tomato based flavor and was amazingly spiced, and the Okra Stew (Soup Kanja) was my absolute favorite because okra is life. Out of the samplers I ended up ordering the Okra Stew (Soup Kanja) with fufu l, and my fiancé got the Red Stu (Chu) with fufu, and we ordered a side of jollof rice (forgot to take pic) which was some of the best rice I have ever had in my life. I could not stop eating it. We also ordered the Appetizer Sampler Platter that came with Fried Plantains: delicious, can't go wrong with plantains, Fattaya Pies (Empanadas): we got the vegetable one and it was so flavorful, and the dough was nice and fresh, Senegalese Egg Rolls (Neem): equally flavorful and the beef and shrimp paired well together with the vermicelli noodles, and Black Eyed Pea Fritters (Akara): had a nice light flavor and paired well with the green dipping sauce. It came with three dipping sauces which paired well with all the appetizers. For a beverage I tried the Hibiscus Juice ""Bissap Wonjo"" which was so fresh, I tasted more hibiscus than mint but it was still fire. My fiancé had the House Margarita, and was feeling a buzz from the first one, so alcoholic drinks are on point. They also had live music playing which created a nice lounge type vibe. Needless to say, this was a great experience. We spent a little under $100 for everything, which was decently priced for the portions you get, and the quality of the food is very fresh! We will definitely be back with more people and to try more food.",0.9937
7-Jun-24,"had a double date with friends at a new restaurant! Calabash is family friendly table seating but the bar is really where my attention was. a cute date spot.the food was delicious. we ordered the appetizer platter, shawarma sandwich, tilapia and a variety of juices. the hibiscus mint juice is my favorite!",0.957
6-Jun-24,This was my first time trying west African food and it will not be my last!!! The service there was amazing and the food was even better. I had the oxtail stew with fufu and the chicken jollof rice. The oxtails were fall off the bone tender and the strew was so flavorful. Can't wait to go back to Calabash! The atmosphere in the restaurant was impressive as well. 10/10 would recommend.,0.941

29-May-24,The food was terrible with little to no flavor. The lamb and fish were terribly overcooked. The only good thing was an eggplant side they brought out with appetizers. It took nearly 2 hours to receive our subpar food. There was a live DJ that was no better than listening to the radio.,-0.578
29-May-24,"Food was very good and amazing and very delicious. Nene was my server, she did a good job and I forgot my purse. Me and my boyfriend was leaving like 15-20 mins ago and I just remembered that I forgot my purse and we called to the restaurant and on that time the restaurant already closed. Nene picked up the phone and she kept it for me and we came to get it. Thank you so much Nene for taking care of it",0.9707
28-May-24,"The food and service here was great! I ordered the Oxtail Stew and was really surprised by the depth of flavor. The spices are really balanced and aren't like other places where there's an overpowering one. The flavor lingers on your palate.  My only downside was that the oxtails were overcooked. Yes, they were tender, but some pieces have been hard boiled for too long, resulting in the moisture/fat cooking off the oxtails.  Some pieces were like bubblegum. The fufu was cooked well and the texture was as I expect. The empanadas were decent. I'll definitely come back for the oxtail stew, just hope that the cooking of the oxtails are more consistent.",0.8755

I enjoyed my visit.,0.9295
19-May-24,"My partner and I were REGULARS every time we'd visit Las Vegas. Our most recent experience was extremely disappointing. We invited our friends and family to come eat with us. We called to reserve a table which they said would be set up by the time we arrived, however, it was not set up. We had to wait to be seated. After that, we waited 50 minutes to get our food even though we were told it would be a 20 minute wait from our waitress named Jewel. After eating, we received our check and split the bill in 4 ways. We went over the receipt with our waitress to make sure everything was correct. Our bill was correct, until our waitress told us to tap our cards to pay after she supposedly put in our orders and the receipt showed that everyone paid more than they were supposed to. Somehow, in total we paid $40 more than what was in our initial bill. Not only was she unable to explain what went wrong, she took money from a tip jar to give to us disregarding how much we were all actually owed. She did all this while implying we were a nuisance to her and keeping her from other tables. We asked for a manager and were told ""our manager can't come, they are in the kitchen"". By then, it was more than 30 minutes since the time we paid. Our time was being wasted and no one was offering options. We were incredibly uncomfortable. After a long back and forth, we begrudgingly received our refund but were told to repay and be double charged for 3-5 business days until the refund could actually return to our accounts. However, our time was wasted and we were treated disrespectfully. We did not want to be double charged for the establishment's mistake. Another employee named Brian came and continued to argue with us until he told us we ""only wanted free food"" and to ""get out and never come back"". Not only were we disrespected and treated as an inconvenience when the restaurant made the mistake, but we were told to never come back to a place we once loved and referred to other people. Do better! Disgustingly unprofessional.",-0.978
18-May-24,The food was great just AMAZING. My boyfriend and I went with my mom for her birthday and I got the Egusi soup my boyfriend got the peanut butter soup and my mom got the oxtail soup and everything was spectacular. Terrance was our waiter and he was such a good guy he helped us figure out what we wanted with samples and made sure we were okay. His service was amazing just like the food. The ambiance was incredible the whole place felt comfortable like I didn't want to leave lol. They had African music playing and the best part is it's family owned.

14-May-24,"We had an amazing experience at Calabash African in Las Vegas! Nene was the best - she took the time to explain the flavors and the culture behind the dishes. She even brought out samples of the entrées so we could try the flavors before buying, which was incredibly thoughtful.We started with the appetizer sampler, and my favorites were the chicken empanadas and the crispy plantains. The plantains were caramelized on the edges, crispy, and so sweet - absolutely delicious. We looked it up and found that plantains are a great source of vitamins and nutrients, making them a healthy choice too.For the main course, we tried the peanut butter cup with goat. The goat was extra tender, and the peanut butter sauce was thick, savory, and perfectly oily. I loved every bite! Paired with the yam dough bread, it was heavenly - chewy and perfect for soaking up all that rich sauce.We will definitely be back to try more items on the menu. This time we went with a spice level of six, but next time we think we can handle an eight. Can't wait for our next visit!",0.9783
13-May-24,This is one of my Favorite places in town 100% have celebrated many special occasions here!!!! Mother's Day recently was exceptionally crowded and the wait was a bit long but was worth every extra Minute!!!

5-May-24,"I heard the hype about this place before going to Vegas so when I arrived, I decided to try it. It's a bit of a drive from the strip but well worth it!I had never had Senegambian food before but my tastebuds were interested. I was greeted warmly and seated promptly when I entered. I received the menu and looked over it several times not sure what to order for my entree. When the waitress came to take my order, she asked if I had tried Senegambian food prior. I admitted to her that I had not and she offered to bring me samples. I ordered the hibiscus drink and the neem eggrolls to start and I anticipated that the samples would help me narrow down my entree choice. She placed the samples on the corresponding menu photos/descriptions and left. Everything I tasted was delicious!!! DELICIOUS!! Afterwards, I still could not decide. When she returned, I told her that she made the decision a lot harder, lol!! I ended up getting the peanut stew with lamb and jollof rice. Divine. The service was great, unfortunately, I do not recall the beautiful young lady's name but she was very sweet and patient. I really enjoyed the music while I was there. And the artwork was very beautiful and empowering. Anyway, I will definitely be back because I need to try everything on the menu.",0.9937

They offered me samples of the stews since it was my first time- a great first experience Sampler: Egusi: so hearty, slightly bitter, and the texture reminded me of mash tofuPeanut butter stew: so peanut buttery and reminded me of Dan Dan Okra stew: Smokey and has semblances of baba ganoush/eggplantsRed stew: perfect blend of spiced tomatos, sweet and savoryWe got:Oxtail Stew with Fufu $28: very flavorful and not stingy with oxtails at all! Fufu was also so fun to eat Side of Jollof Rice $7: smoky, spice-y, and the perfect charred rice texture The decor and music stayed true to African roots.

22-Apr-24,"HONEST REVIEW FROM MY EXPERIENCE: The place is nice. Clean for the most part (minor things but overall clean place)Was not what I expected when walking in. They had a nice dj and played good music but just was a tad bit too loud for a SunDAY and it wasn't anything special going on. It kinda gave club vibes and I had to talk loud just for my family to hear me speak at our table and when speaking to waitress I had to speak loud so she could hear me. It would have been great if something was going on. There was a tall lady that was very nice and I loved her and wished she was our server. She served our drinks. Our actual server was ok, I just wish she would have come more often and checked on us. We had to wait a while to be checked on and took her forever to bring the check and it wasn't a lot of guest present so maybe she just has to work on moving a little faster and showing better customer service as if she wants to be at work. Also, when we asked questions about options, she was very vague. I had to call my African friend and ask her what would she suggest to order. Overall, this would be a nice spot to just come to for a drink or so but I do not think I will come back to eat. The food is ok, but I've had way better. Also, it has had myself and my family sick the entire night running to bathroom. Like to the point we may have to call in to work ‍. One of us ordered the okra soup with chicken and it was supposedly charred but it was very much so burnt. You could taste the burnt taste in the soup as if they had the heat too high and left the food cooking too long without stirring. The waitress said that is how they cook it which is when I realized I probably would not come back. Had it been a mistake then I would have understood but if this is how the dish will taste EVERYTIME.. no ma'am!! I'll pass! The oxtails were a little too tough for me compared to what I've had before as well. It kept getting stuck in my teeth and one of the oxtails was slightly pink in the inside (I noticed when I got home to attempt to eat leftovers.. it wasn't as tough as the others) The empanadas weren't bad but they weren't good either (it is good enough to order however) I did eat them. The chicken wings were ok. I actually liked the bbq sauce that came with it. I dipped my fries in it. I LOVED the pineapple ginger and the hibiscus. A must try however they do not give refills for those. I would have to say my total for the meal was not worth it, but I am glad that I was able to try it out. I hope my review helps improvement. Everyone has a different experience and different taste buds but this was my experience. I expected more from what I saw from a popular IG post that made me want to try and I was slightly disappointed. I'm not from here and it has been very difficult trying to find good food here in Vegas which can be irritating at times. Overall: 2.8Ambience: 4Service: 2Food: 2.5",0.9981

My only thing I would is I would give the empanadas 4/5 instead of 5/5 bc I feel like there wasn't too much meat/filling in them (esp the beef compared to chicken  )  Also: they have a lunch special as well where everything is 16 dollars and comes with a side ( I did not opt for that menu though)",0.9834

17-Mar-24,Food was amazing! We went on a Sunday so there was a DJ that kept us dancing in our seats the entire time. Everyone in our parry said they would definitely return. I love that they have lots of vegetarian/vegan options and they are listed in a separate section on the menu.,0.8999

16-Mar-24,"The first time I tried their food I had my parents bring me an order of oxtail stew to California after seeing it on Vegas Starfish's IG... it was so good. But tonight we came back and had dinner. The food was beyond amazing, the service was great, the ginger/pineapple juice was refreshing, the vibe was sensational, the music made it over the top. I mean - he had us all singing along to the music, I gave him all my cash. But the FOOD, whew, I can't wait to come back! 10/10 recommend this place.",0.9636
11-Mar-24,"Went to Calabash African Kitchen for the first time yesterday.  5 stars doesn't give it justice.  Everything was amazing!  The ambiance is perfect.  Very comfortable atmosphere.  We were greeted by our waiter, Terrance, whose joyous energy was contagious.  He was very attentive and thoroughly explained the menu.  We ordered the ginger pineapple juice and Senegambia ice tea (both delicious!) and for appetizers the plantain and the Fataya Pies.  Terrence went to order these and came back with four samples of the soups/stews.  As soon as I tasted the Mafe-Domoda, I was back in my days in Ghana.  We had to order that and also the Red Stew ""Chu"".  I ordered mine with fufu.  As for the food, the plantains were perfectly cooked, the pies made a very good appetizer.  Both stews were excellent.  I can't wait to go back and order other dishes.  Everything looked wonderful and I eventually will have to try everything on the menu.  You won't be disappointed here!",0.9866

9-Mar-24,Excuse me- I was very calm... as we cannot leave response I will now leave one star for the lying... I was very calm did not yell I simply told her I had a dirty bowl. She then tried to lie and say it was stained... but I had already cleaned some with my fork so I knew that was not true. When I started scrubbing it with my spoon in front of her to show her thats when she said sorry. Which is a start but leaving feeling sick my food should have been refunded that should be the 1st thing offered but none of that never came out of her mouth.... Thats on her to offer not me to ask but if she had asked i would have then inserted the options I felt were suitable... at the end of the day just have someone clean them all with a scrubber side of a sponge... obviously some dishes are not coming clean in the dishwasher alone... and now 2 days later I am sick with some sort of cold.... Pretty sure it was eating from that filthy bowl... u guys could still refund me if u wanted to... still havent heard that... if they do I will update this,0.3521

Highly recommend dining in and enjoying one of their margaritas. Never had a margarita so fresh and that hint of ginger omg. I have a 4 margarita minimum everytime I go will not disappoint.,0.9803
24-Feb-24,"The only reason for two stars is because the DJ was more welcoming than the server and bartender. I went in with my sister and two nephews to try their oxtail soup. Worst  Customer Service: we weren't welcomed, and it took over ten minutes to have anyone come to our table.  Mind you, there were only two other tables sat aside from ours. I worked as a server and know the industry; therefore It is an excellent restaurant inside, but the staff doesn't match. The food wasn't good, and I will not be coming back or recommending it. They were overpriced and salty. Don't waste your time.",0.0689

18-Feb-24,Two of my girlfriends and I went to have lunch here after church. The food was good but the customer service sucked. At a point I found myself nervous and scared to ask for anything. If you're a black American this is not the place for you to patronize. I asked the lady NaNa/NeNe for a spoon and instead of her placing it in my hand it was put on the table when my hand was out. I later asked for a plastic bag (because our server never came to check on us) she asked around to see who my server was instead of providing me a bag. She was not busy. She was serving two tables one African family that was done eating and a African couple who had just gotten there and had already ordered. By the way she moved there seat from next to us (without them asking). The husband's response was oh ok upon her informing them of the move. I was over charged on my bill and because I recognized it and requested that it be fixed the server Sonia got an attitude (young black girl with dread extensions). Needless to say we will not be back.,-0.5187

16-Feb-24,"Ate here last year and forgot to leave a review but it was delicious. I had egusi with fufu and my friend had the ndembe bean stew. Everything was incredible. Plantains were so fire. The server was super nice and asked if we wanted to try a taste of anything before we ordered it. She could tell we were brand new to African cuisines. Shout out for making people feel welcome. Wish I could remember her name. Restaurant was busy but the atmosphere was good. Seemed like everybody was genuinely happy to be there which is rare for a restaurant. If you're visiting Vegas, get off the strip and try this place. If you live in Vegas you have no excuse!",0.988

All of it was the best African food we have had and the entire family loved it. We also tried the Senegambian tea and it was delicious. We were served by a kind lady named Nene (I am not exactly sure how to spell it) and the staff were friendly, always wanting to make sure we are comfortable. If you are new to African food, they can guide you on what to order. The restaurant was clean and comfortable with an inviting atmosphere. Overall, I highly recommend you come here when in the Vegas area.",0.9832

8-Feb-24,This was very hard for me to rate. The setting was BEAUTIFUL. Amazing vibes and they HAD LIVE MUSIC that sets the tone of a very calm and enjoyable night. The food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. They seemed very understaffed and it took almost an hour to receive my food. But they made up for the wait with a nice bar to drink beer at and a super dope performer who played the best music . I'd have to give it a 2 1/2 start. I'd bump it up to a three. But they must do better with timing because no one wants to wait almost an hour for their food.,0.9799
8-Feb-24,"I wanted to try it So we ordered dishes we are familiar with like rice, oxtail ect, then one of the staff suggest the cassava with goat is geart its her favorite, so we ordered that, not being used to cassava leaf, it tasted vile, we asked if we can change it, they said no.So we left it on thd table, it bad customer service.

We ordered about $130 worth of food, which include: Jollof rice, Empanadas , Plantains, Neem Senegalese Egg Rolls , oxtail stew/soup with fufu, Red Stew, and Lamb chops. For drink we had the Ginger Pineapple Juice & Bissau Wonjo.  Everything was made fresh to order, and tasted very good! The service was very good as well. A young lady name Sonia (according to the check) managed to serve four tables and gather everyone's orders without pen and pad. You go girl! She often checked on everyone to ensure the food was good and nothing further was needed. The ambiance was beautiful and modern. In comparison to West African restaurants in Los Angeles, the restaurant was upscale. The decor was very well thought out with  variations of beige, brown, and greens. She definitely has a gem!",0.9816

28-Jan-24,"Been wanting to try African food for soo long!! Came across this spot and I they did not disappoint. Let's start with service, they were friendly and hard working. Looks like a family running place. There was a dj who's playing all kinds of music, African included so you really get the vibe. It's located in a plaza so plenty of loathing. We went around 1:30 and there was plenty of people inside but still had a few tables for us to sit. Not sure if they take reservations but if they do you should make it. Food: I tried the fried plantains, oxtail soup with fufu, and Joll of rice with beef. The plantains were as good as a plantain could be. Can't say I've ever been a fan but this one was not bad. Soft on the inside, nice and fried on the outside. I was dying to try fufu. The oxtail soup was so good and flavorful. You can choose the side you want, we wanted fufu. I'd highly recommend this dish, did not disappoint. The joll of rice was okay. Rice was a little dry but I'm not sure if that's the way it's supposed to be for the culture. Honestly will go back to try egusi soup. We were 2 people and we couldn't finish the food, so I'd say sharing is smart.",0.9899

21-Jan-24,"Calabash is a gem of a restaurant! The food was exquisitely flavorful. There's a dj on Sundays playing very cool music.  The restaurant has great vibes and fun lighting. The server was soooo helpful. She gave great recommendations and brought out samples of 4 different popular stews which was great because it was our first time trying African cuisine. We particularly loved the red stew and the okra stew. We ordered those with chicken and the chicken was soo good. Tender and packed with flavor.  My seven year old daughter ate almost her whole plate of red stew with chicken and rice.  I had the fufu with my okra stew, and the fufu was definitely interesting. I'm so glad I tried it, but if you have a texture sensitivity it might not be for you. My husband had the grilled tilapia with jollof rice. He really enjoyed it and we really  loved the onion that came with it. The portions were generous! And we all ate a ton, but left feeling light and not weighed down. Oh and try the pineapple ginger juice. It's heavy on the ginger, but so refreshing and great for digestion!  We'll definitely be back!",0.9941
20-Jan-24,"I was excited to find Calabash African Kitchen during our short stay in Vegas. I was greeted by a friendly staff member and once I mentioned it was my first time trying African cuisine she brought me some samples. It was very difficult to choose since everything I tasted was delicious! I ended up going  with the Red stew with rice and oxtail with fufu. I placed my order to go. The music playing and friendly staff made the wait time fly by, I don't think I waited long before I received my order. The person who helped me was right when she told me I would fall in love and want more. I cannot wait to be back in Vegas to eat this delicious food again.",0.9686

11-Jan-24,"Calabash African Kitchen left a lasting impression on me, especially with their Oxtail Soup. The cozy atmosphere and warm service set the stage for a delightful dining experience. Now, let's talk about the Oxtail Soup - it was a burst of rich flavors, with tender oxtail meat that practically melted in my mouth. The spices and seasoning were on point, making it a comforting and memorable dish. If you're a fan of hearty soups, Calabash's Oxtail Soup is a must-try.",0.9349
11-Jan-24,"I had seen photos of the food and knew it'd be great. I've had Ethiopian food from friends prior so I had a idea of how good it'd be but nothing could've prepared me for how good it really was. I asked the hostess to help pick between dishes and she gave me a great recommendation and later also happily gave me a response to a question I had at the end.Aside from the AMAZING food that felt like it was home made as soon as I walked into the store I noticed how small it looked but the ambience was charming enough especially with the music playing, I found myself dancing from time to time and everything was great.I plan on coming again my grandmother and I both loved everything this place had to offer. (Tip if you plan on enjoying this place being patient is the best way to do so, I say this because several of low reviews were complaining about it the wait)",0.9952

3-Jan-24,"A few weeks ago I tried Afro Caribbean cuisine for the first time in Detroit. I haven't stopped thinking about it. I live in Vegas so it was my mission to find a place here for similar food. Today, I discovered Calabash African Kitchen. There is ample seating and spacious enough for live entertainment. I wasn't sure what to order. I have only tried jollof rice and jerk chicken. The staff brought me four samples of various dishes with completely different tastes. I ended up ordering jollof rice, red stew (chu) with chicken, and fufu - absolutely heavenly. I enjoyed parts of the chicken I'd normally avoid. I found myself sucking everything I could off of the bones until nothing was left. The red stew was so savory I had to sit there and think about it. Thank you to bartender/waitress for the excellent suggestions and the owner for being so kind. Can't wait to go back and bring friends along for this delicious experience. Thanks, Calabash!I attached a not so great picture of the stew and fufu. I hate taking pictures of my food. It's cringy.",0.9646
2-Jan-24,"This restaurant is a MUST TRY. It has left me speechless but I will try to describe the heavenly experience I just had. Ambience: tasteful, elegant, but culturally rooted. Beautiful SeneGambian artwork along the walls and the culture is similarly woven into the music playing over the speakers. Great vibes. Service: 10/10. My server was exceptionally kind and asked questions to customize her recommendations  of the dishes. Every single dish I sampled was phenomenal but in the end I went with the Mafe Domoda (peanut butter stew) and the Chu Stew with Jollof rice. Food: Exceptional. The spices, the savoriness, the tang -- all balanced magically. It was an amazing experience. The meat, both the lamb with the Mafe Domoda and the chicken with the Chu Stew were exceptionally tender and full of flavor. For an appetizer I had the Fataya-pies in seafood and vegetable flavors. Needless to say this matched the amazing quality of everything else. I have nothing but high praise for this restaurant.",0.9902

The marinade on the tilapia is so good and the okra stew was super flavorful. Will definitely come back and try their drinks during happy hour which is 4-6 PM on weekdays.",0.9904
27-Dec-23,"Went to go eat yesterday (12/26/2023) and let me say it was all SO delish! We had seen Fufu on Tiktok and looked up a place that sells them, and this was it. I ordered the Goat Pepper Soup and my friend got the Oxtail Stew. OMG, it was SOOO good. And the Fufu was so good. The whole experience was amazing. Our server was so sweet and really recommended some good drinks. Also, the music, the decor, and the all-out vibe make you feel like you're not in Vegas and somewhere different. Highly recommend trying the food here. Even if you're not into Fufu, everything else is immaculate. Will be returning to eat here again.",0.9782
26-Dec-23,Food was great and the customer service matched. They were very welcoming and offered help with the menu by giving advice on which dishes were favorites. The fufu was also so yummy and fun to eat (it was our first time trying it). Can't wait to come back,0.9723

24-Dec-23,"This restaurant is disgusting, the food is pure oil, and they overcharged me and didn't want to give me my money back, the waiters were very dirty and the food was horrible, I don't recommend it at all, don't waste your money here",-0.8777
24-Dec-23,"After seeing Tik Toks about this restaurant I decided to try it.  I really wanted it to work out since I'm all for family businesses but unfortunately Calabash did not deliver.  I drove 37 minutes to get here and walking in my husband who is Cuban immediately said he did not want to eat here.  I was really eager to taste the food so I decided to get it to go.  I can't speak badly about the service because it wasn't bad.  The gentleman that took my order was very nice and helped me with the menu.  It was a to go order so I only tipped $2.  Immediately after I got my food I thought wow this is a little bit of food for $40 dollars.  Once I got home I was extremely dissappointed since I went in wanting to try a new cuisine and what I got was missing rice and bread (fufu).  And a greasy mess of stew.  I would say too oily for my liking. I was not able to eat this food because 1 it was too oily and 2 no one is able to eat oily stew without rice or fufu.  When I called the restaurant to complain I was told I would get a call back since I was requesting a refund.  24 hours later and still no call I try calling back again.  The gentleman that answered the phone said he was the one that took my order and he assured me I did not ask for rice but he did not comment on the fufu.  He then said the manager was not available and said the call was breaking up (how coincidental)! He then laughed that I mentioned I left a 2 dollar tip when I didn't have to because it was a to go order.  10 min later the manager calls me and says she viewed the cameras and that I did receive the fufu.  Then when I explained what I actually got she changed the story.  I specifically showed the waiter what I wanted by showing him an instagram picture.  The manager says it only comes with 1 side of either rice or fufu which is not my fault that the waiter did not tell me this.  I specifically said I wanted the beef with the rice and I know 100 percent I said this because I over heard the customer next to me saying the rice was so delicious so I definitely wanted to try it and I asked the waiter if fufu was included and he said yes. I'm seeking a partial refund ( I did eat the empanadas and they didn't taste horrible but was not a fan) for having me waste time, and money for a bad experience, missing food, and energy.I'm so disappointed with this restaurant I think my expectations were to high. I'm so embarrassed for the African community that some people will visit and think that this level of hospitality is representative of their culture.",0.9785
22-Dec-23,I really enjoyed the red snapper here. It was so flavorful and the jollof rice was great too. I decided to get a strawberry mango calabash margarita and it was really good. The plantains weren't sweet enough for me and I think it should come with a spicy sauce of some sort. The okra stew was good but wasn't my favorite out of all of the dishes I had. Maybe I'm too spoiled from Sierra Leone okra stew lol. My friend had the goat pepper soup and it was tasty as well. Service could be a bit better but overall I enjoyed myself and would come again.,0.9734

She is from Ghana, so she is very accustomed to African cuisine, but for the rest of our group, myself included, had never tried any African cuisine before. So this was a treat! As we entered, I noticed how amazingly clean the entire restaurant was kept. Very nice! Our servers were pretty busy, although there were not many tables in use. My girl also said that the last time she visited, they were busy and it took a while. Even our food took a bit of time to come out. Just something to be aware of. Once the food came out, everything was very fresh and extremely flavorful! It was awesome! I'm so glad we got to try this out and let Calabash be our first experience with this type of cuisine. I had the goat soup, and loved it! The wait was worth it, and overall I think everyone should try it.",0.9916

What a great Ambience this restaurant has and the food hands down... the best! The waitress is there are so kind they always ask if it's their first time they'll have no problem in giving you samples on trying their different sauces and different juices I was really impressed and the plate sizes are huge for the price that you pay. I love that even though this isn't my ethnic a background the owner and all the employees never made you feel uncomfortable coming into the establishment which I really appreciated.

21-Nov-23,"This was an experience since I've never has Senegalese food. I have to apologize because I dont remember the original name of the dishes we ordered but we tried a few:Fried plantains- I love fried platanos so this was an easy one and I love how it complimented the savory dishes. Must have.Beef empanada- this one had a crispy shell with tasty filling of your choice, we picked beef and it was really good.Oxtail stew with fufu- this was sooo good and savory, the oxtail was cooked well and I the sauce of it was more liquidy, probably best with rice aa you can really mix it in with the sauce to get every bit of it. And trust me you're going to want every bit of it!Lamb peanut stew with rice- this was one I was really looking forward to try. The lamb was a bit more chewy but still tasted good, the sauce tasted so good as it reminded me of one of our own Filipino dish called kare-kare, which also have peanut in the sauce. I really love this dish and went well with rice and the fufu since the sauce was in a thicker creamier side.We also true some of the traditional juices which we really enjoyed because the owner who was helping us let us try samplers, which was really cool. I really like this place and woukd love to come back. Just note that lunch time can be busy and they seem to only have a few servers so please be patient and know the food will be delicious!",0.9983

The problem with this place is service oriented. Their wait time for take out is dismal! Quite frankly, it is insulting. The best part ( yes...sarcasm) is that they make you pay for your order right away, yet they tell you nothing about how long it's gonna take ( over 40 minutes!!!!!!). You have to wait forever... no drinks or anything... and with no warning of how long it is going to take, so no chance to sit and order something while waiting. Do they need more chefs in the kitchen? Whatever it is, call in your order or don't bother!!! It is also not cheap, yet it is a clean restaurant that seems understaffed. The kitchen does not even seem to know what food is being given to you! No one seems to know their right from their left related to take out orders. I would not ever consider coming here again. I personally disliked the food so I am not an African food fan, yet clearly a lot of people like the food. Despite a good server, the overall service is average likely due to being understaffed from our clear impression. Overall, just 3 stars and a fail for me. A big no for me. As an added note, after we got our food order, something may have been missing, and somehow the server had to take the whole order back to the kitchen to have it checked after we were waiting for at least five minutes after receiving the food ( after already waiting an additional previous 45 minutes!). They did not seem to believe the server when she was concerned that items were missing and all this does is cause a further delay, and the food is getting cold while we are waiting.",0.4224
17-Nov-23,This experience was very authentic and the food was top tier. Would recommend to any and all food lovers.,0.7717
14-Nov-23,"If I could give 100 stars I would!! My cousin and I came to try this place and first of all, the dining room is beautiful and is intimate and playful at the same time . When we started to order we asked our server for her recommendations and she brought over a sample of all their popular soups . Everything was so flavorful and the tastes just pop in your mouth ! The iced tea with pineapple and lime is the most refreshing drink I've had in a long time, my cousin got a glass of sangria and it was so tasty ! We got the appetizer sampler and everything on the plate was perfection .. she even told us which sauces paired best with each appetizer ..I ordered the oxtail soup and my cousin ordered the red stew and both were immaculate in presentation and taste ! The server even sat down and showed us the proper way to eat our fufu and that was extremely helpful and made this dinner not just a stop for a quick bite but a full experience that will bring us coming back for more ! Nene was our server and she was a joy! We can't wait to come back and eat more",0.959
14-Nov-23,"Everything bout this place gives me the best energy. from the music , to the ambiance/ interior design. the Food has always been good when I come . I always get the  peanut butter stew . (my favorite !) I like their service because they read my vibes lol don't bother me :)",0.9464
14-Nov-23,"This place is insane. We saw this restaurant from Keith Lee on tiktok and boy, it did not disappoint. No one at the table had any experience with African cuisine and so our questions were met with samples of the most popular dishes and led us in a great direction. The owner even came to our table and explained a lot about the dishes and what we were eating. We got the empanadas, red stew, and yassa and it was some of the most flavorful food I've ever had. If you're in Vegas this is a must try spot and we might even be back before our week trip is up.",0.8243

29-Oct-23,"Absolute fabulous meal and wonderful restaurant! Calabash has been on my list for awhile, and yesterday I found myself craving an early supper. I was greeted warmly at the door, sat right away, and set up with a delicious ginger margarita in no time. I ordered the peanut butter stew with lamb and plantains, and I'm already dreaming of going back again! The stew was thick, fragrant, and full of warm flavors, jollof was very tasty with a bite of spice, and the bananas were perfectly dark and crispy outside and creamy inside. The space is scrupulously clean, inviting and open. There was excellent music playing when I came in. Then they switched to some jazz, a little live singing, and I saw a man setting up with a guitar. The owner was sweet and kind, and totally hooked me up with a good place to go dancing!I'll be back!",0.9902
28-Oct-23,"Very nice restaurant.  Very clean.  Good service.  I've never had West African food before.  It was good, but not my cup of tea so I may not be back.  My only complaint is that my lamb was a bit too heavily salted, but the fufu was good as was the peanut stew.",0.7982
26-Oct-23,What a WONDERFUL SURPRISE! My boyfriend took me here for lunch and I was skeptical because I've been disappointed with the African restaurants in Vegas but this is the ONE. FOOD WAS SPECTACULAR. The service was great and the ambiance is GORGEOUS! I will definitely be returning!!,0.9678

22-Oct-23,"I've been wanting to try west African food for some years now (considering genetically I have some west African descent). Very friendly on the phone when ordering on the phone and friendly when I walked in. The food is made fresh! It was still hot with after a 20 minute drive back. So much flavor in the jollof rice and oxtail tail. The fufu is great to dip in the oxtail juice. I think the prices are reasonable also considering that The portions are huge.  It's enough to feed 2-3 people. The restaurant inside is clean with a nice African vibe to it. I loved it. When I'm in the area, I will definitely be back to eat here. If you want to try some fresh and excellent west African food come here.",0.9866

17-Oct-23,The Jolof rice with chicken is fire comes with a lot of grilled onions. I also tried the Egusi with fish & fufu. Egusi was too fishy for my taste but I would give it another shot with Chicken instead. Fufu is like a bland mashed potato but it does compliment the dish. The service is SLOW. Be prepared to wait 45 minutes AFTER you order.,0.8422
15-Oct-23,I came in to bring my Mother an Kids to grab a bite & they completely ignored the fact that we were waiting to be seated. I became very uncomfortable and embarrassed as if they were just waiting for us to disappear.. I was really looking forward to buy a lot of food im really disappointed,-0.892
12-Oct-23,"This place is our favorite Resturant in Las Vegas, the service is always quick, easy, personalized, and empathetic. All the employees are just amazing!What we ordered:We can around happy hour 3pm-6pm soCocktails and appetizers were on sale 25% off I believe Appetizers:2 for $7Beef Empanadas: very good minced beef with a kickof spice.Chicken Empanadas: shredded chicken less spicy than the beef.Seafood Empanada: my favorite out of the 4 strong flavor of seafood from a variety of different clams, imitation crab ect absolutely delicious. Vegetarian Empanada: mixed veggies super delicious all of these empanadas are worth trying. All is served with a bell pepper spice sauce that is spicy but so good you just can't stop dipping. Fried Plantains $7Savory and sweet perfect to pair with some Jollof Rice.Drink I ordered the Jamaica-sweet and tart love the rich flavor of the hibiscusOkra Stew ""soup Kanja"" $19Ordered as vegetarian with a side of FuFu. Slightly oily, but the rich flavor of okra and the thickness of the soup gives it a nice gumbo feel. Flavor is delicious a little spicy but overall very good.Red Stew Chu with Chicken: $19 plus $2 for chicken Between this one and the Kanja soup this one was my favorite chicken was grilled and cooked perfectly. There were two legs and thighs connected topped with a thick, tomatoey consistency of salsa with the flavor was just so good. I could eat the sauce with literally anything. We also. This with the food field.Ordered a side of Jollof Rice $7 This is a must the rice served with any of their stew/soups just brings everything to a max level of deliciousness. I could eat here every day we have tried almost everything on their menu. I have a few items that I have not tried yet. I'm looking forward to trying the Goat Pepper Soup and the Egusi Soup next. The inside is nothing you would imagine from the outside. It's a huge open space, music playing that makes you move, bar in the middle with music videos playing. Then you get your food and omg your in heaven.",0.9983
8-Oct-23,"This was our first time having Senegambian food and it didn't disappoint. The egusi and palasas stews were excellent, as was the little side of jollof we got. We'd had nigerian versions of these dishes and there was a lot about it that felt pretty similar. Everything tasted a little sweeter? It's quality stuff and better than any West African food in the Bay Area. We also enjoyed the youtube playlist showing some neat Senegalese music videos.",0.9542
8-Oct-23,I loved everything about Calabash. The waitresses were so pleasant and explained the menu to me very well. I loved the music and how fast my food came out. I've been here at least 4 times within 6 months and I must say it is the best African cuisine I've had yet. No complaints!!!! The black eyed pea stew was the best of it all! I just love everything about this place.,0.9818
7-Oct-23,"I'll keep it short and sweet. From the second I stepped into the restaurant I knew I was going to have a great experience, my girlfriend and I were seated almost immediately and then shortly after the owner came to our table and asked if this was our first time eating here. Both my girlfriend and I are from D.C. and have had our fair share of African food but we let her take the stage as she explained the entire menu, giving her own personal recommendations. She was so kind, offering samples of everything we were ""unsure"" about. We both got the ginger pineapple juice, which was sweet and spicy, and sooo delicious. For our entrees I ordered the oxtail soup with fufu, and my girlfriend ordered the peanut butter stew with fufu. They were both divine, each had their own complex flavor that I had never experienced before. It was a little pricey but absolutely worth it! I plan on coming back next weekend to try the egusi with goat!!",0.9878
5-Oct-23,"I'm the type of person who could eat soups and stews every single day, so Calabash is not only an entire vibe, it's also a treasure trove of culinary delights. On this particular visit, I ordered the peanut stew, and it was a stratospheric success! It was aggressively spiced with layers and layers of flavor, and every single element on the plate was in perfect harmony. I thoroughly enjoyed the dish while dining in at the restaurant as well as the leftovers I brought home with me. In terms of service, the front of the house staff are generally friendly and personable, and while I've occasionally experienced long waits for my food in the past, I can assure you the food was definitely worth the wait!! :)",0.9845

19-Sep-23,"This review is way overdue. I've eaten here four times in the last year. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but I live in Hawaii. Every time I come to Vegas I HAVE to get my Calabash fix. When I'm traveling I always try to eat food I can't get at home and I don't usually go to the same restaurant twice. So when I tell you I eat here EVERY time, its just that good. It's located in the corner of a strip mall which doesn't look very exciting from the outside but when you walk in the door it's a totally different story. The restaurant is gorgeous! Very modern, clean and inviting. It's got fantastic energy and there are usually music videos playing upbeat music. The owners and employees are very welcoming and are very patient explaining the different dishes and making recommendations. The wife is the heart and soul of the restaurant. You can see her pride and love in the food and excellent service.  I've tried a few different dishes, all delicious. My favorite is the cassava leaf stew with lamb. I love it with the fufu(tried it with rice the last time I was there). They are open for lunch and dinner. The portions are generous and there's something for everyone on the menu. Bonus- There's a full bar! You can even use delivery apps and have it brought to you if you can't get to them. Thinking about it makes my mouth water. Can't wait for my next Vegas trip!",0.997
16-Sep-23,So I've seen really good reviews about this place. Unfortunately it wasn't that great for me I got egusi too go with lamb.....it had flavor but at the end of the bite it gets really bitter the lamb was very hard there was barely any sauce or soup broth yet it's a soup. The staff were really nice. But the prices are steep for what you get. Like I said I got the egusi for 25$ and I got my husband red snapper fried with fry's he gave his fry's away he said they were no good that was a 33.$ plate so that is 58$ but it came up to 67$! So for 67$ I'm hoping the food would be great. The restaurant was beautiful nice place too sit and eat. They had good music a big tv and nice art on the wall. I will be going back one more time too try the okra stew and peanut butter stew. I say try it for yourself because everyone's taste buds are different! Egusi is ok wouldn't be something I'd crave! But I will try something different next time. The foo foo was really good! Hopefully my next time there will be a better experience.,0.99

14-Sep-23,"We had an amazing experience here! Immediately walking in, the decor and environment is lively and welcoming. It was our first time trying African food, and our waitress was more than helpful with the menu. She let us try samples of a few of the stews to ensure that we'd love whatever dishes that we ordered. This was such a thoughtful touch on the experience. Everything we tasted was delicious, but we decided on the egusi stew with jollof rice. We also ordered the oxtail stew with fufu. The oxtail was flavorful and tender and was even better with the fufu. The egusi stew was a new, unique flavor to me, and I loved it with the jollof rice. This was a great first experience to a different cultures crusine!",0.9839

I will say! It was all worth it and it was my first time trying everything. I will definitely be going back to try the Egusi and a few other items I saw on the menu.The mango mojito was so good I had to ask who made it, and our server Brooke told me she did! 10/10 highly recommend...Brooke was a really great server.

31-Aug-23,"This is my first time trying Senegalese + Gambian food, and it was really delicious. First off, there's plenty of parking, and as soon as you enter the restaurant, it has a very modern and beautiful bar area. We were seated immediately, and you can already feel the relaxed atmosphere here. If you're in a rush, I would not recommend this place just because the service here goes at its own pace, which was not a bad thing, I actually enjoyed a very chill dinner. Next the food - we wanted to try everything but not over order for the 2 of us.Drinks: the Ginger Pineapple was soooo good. It literally is fresh squeezed ginger, and the natural sweetness of the pineapple juice. The Baobab was interesting but yummy - it's like a horchata, and the cinnamon replaced with tamarind. Fried Plantains: it was such a great appetizer, sweet enough, starchy and great texture. I can eat these all day! Oxtail Stew w/ Fufu: meat was super tender and cooked perfectly, with whole peeled potato and carrot. The broth was very flavorful and almost salty, which is why they serve it with fufu, the white sticky bread thing - I just dropped a few pieces into the stew and ate it like a cereal and it worked. It's simple and tasty. Jollof Rice w/ Fish: get this for sure! We went with the fish at the recommendation of the server and we're so glad we did. The rice is super flavorful (I think it's tomato paste?), along with the veggies and fish. If you haven't tried African food before, this is a great way to start. I'll be coming back to try more items on the menu!",0.9982

She was very informative and introduced us to each dish seeing as it was me and my family's first time eating there. Everything was delicious, came out fresh, greatly portioned. My favorite was the oxtails! Omg the flavors were top tier and eating it with the fufu was the perfect combo. The ginger soda was sweet and refreshing. And the plantains were also sweet with a nice crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely come back here.",0.9938

I had a tasty mango margarita that went down so smooth and slowly crept up on me over the course of my meal. My bestie had a Baobab that was sooo delicious and refreshing also a heavy hitter. We started with the appetizer platter. The egg rolls, empanadas, plantains and fritters were so tasty we had to slow down by the advice of our lovely waitress . We had Oxtail Stew with fufu, Red Snapper with Chu sauce, rice and a salad. The food was sooo flavorful and rich and just amazing! Finger licking good! Literally! I danced with every bite!

Since it was our first time trying the food she actually gave us samples of the sauces and soups to see if they were to our liking and omg they were all amazing! She helped recommend some dishes so we could get everything we wanted. My favorite was the egusi (similar to overly scrambled eggs), the chicken empanadas were flavorful and juicy, okra soup (it was not slimy and similar to green beans) and fufu (if mashed potatoes and mochi had a baby). My sister had the Red stew (like a chunky tomato soup). The Hibiscus Juice was also amazing almost like a grape juice with mint. The place was also super clean with great music!

5-Aug-23,"So, before I start, I have had Calabash's food at its finest. About a year and a half ago, the food was absolutely incredible! I went today to be sorely disappointed by the egusi (usually one of my faves) and overall cost and presentation of what I ordered. Firstly, the egusi tripe was very hard and undercooked which is a bummer because I love tripe in my egusi stew! Secondly, the way they nickel and dime to the extend of charging $70+ for 2 plates of food really blows my mind. I would have felt better about the price if the tripe was tender! Dang! I'm here to say that the food doesn't taste as good as it did but it's decent. That having been said, I would try other African restaurants before returning, although I do love the ambiance and friendly staff. The wait times are quite long and not even a glass of water is offered for your time.",0.9227
5-Aug-23,"Still the neighborhood restaurant I'm most privileged to enjoy!For keyword-search purposes (NOT rating!!), considerations for people with autistic, spectrum, dental, dyspraxic/dyspraxia, and/or social anxiety friendly/friendliness concerns:All the meat (which means poultry and fish as well, for those who inexplicably think those things aren't ""meat"") is prepared and served with the bones in it (except in some of the appetizers). If you dislike having to deal with bones or want to avoid doing so in public company, THIS IS A WONDERFUL RESTAURANT! because all of the stews can be made without added meat, and the strong point of the cuisine here is the SAUCES/soups/stews and you will not miss ANYTHING by ordering off the vegetarian menu. I haven't asked whether boneless meat is available because I am pretty sure it isn't (and would be inauthentic).If you or a family member are okay with flavors and with textures of sauces over rice, but have dental or other issues with CHUNKS or bones or strings, the vegetarian mafé will be the best culinary field trip in the whole 702!! It's a SMOOTH earthy/mildly spicy rich happy sauce. The egusi is more ""vegetabley"" (and delicious!). The cassava stew is REALLY vegetabley and leaf-stringy, and a little spicier (and delicious!)!Fufu is probably challenging for people with sensory issues or who don't want to get food on their hands/fingernails. To a person with sensory issues, it's Play Doh-textured and tastes kind of like instant mashed potatoes and the goal is for you to pick up a little wad in your hand, poke a hole in it with your thumb, use that thimble to dollop up some stew, and eat the whole thing in one bite. If this sounds unappealing, order the rice as your side dish! (I suspect that if you ask for a little sample of fufu and explain your concerns they will give you one. You might like the taste--I actually do! But if you don't want to have grainy residue on your hand, go for the rice. Fufu isn't forkable!) Pro tip to all first-timers: take the shiny Saran Wrap off your ball of fufu before you poke your thumb in! (And then re-wrap it! They serve it like that for a reason: the outside starts to dry out instantly once exposed to air!)You definitely want to ask first if there is a possibility of bones in your food if this will be an issue. The people here are very nice and won't lie to you! I assure you that YOU WILL NOT MISS OUT by ordering the egusi or mafé without meat. They are not HOT-spicy at all, and have rich magnificent nutty flavors. (And if your dinner date mocks you for it, they're a jerk and you luckily learned that early on!) It won't be appropriate at this restaurant to ask for boneless meat; they don't cook or prepare it that way.",0.9969
30-Jul-23,"Hey guy i stumbled upon this this place and I looked it up and i seen it had so many wonderful reviews so I decided to leave one to But a terrible one me and my wife decided to come and try it out we got there and waited 20 minutes for us to get seated (The restaurant wasn't even full) but like dumass's we decided to wait. We got seated and guess what lady's and gentlemen another 15-20 minutes till a waiter came to us. So almost and hour just there being dumass's so we ordered our drinks and food and the lady told us it was going to take like 15 minutes because they had a big table at least like 10 people and it was just that big table and other table of 4 and lower but there was still tables open keep in mind so we just said we understand and kid you not we WAITED 1 HOUR And not even that THEY FORGOT ABOUT US  so I ask a waiter for our check (we still haven't even seen our food) and she was like ""okay"" and you guys won't believe what happen the girl came out with our food ready on plates and guess what they were cold asfk they just had our food out there in the kitchen waiting till it got legs so it come to us by itself like wtf and they still decided to charge us the food (75$) and the drinks we didn't even get to see so I just paid it cause I didn't wanna get jumped in there you know what I mean so I paid it and we left very disappointed so we just gave it to a homeless like good people not letting food go to waste and they didn't like the food HAHAHAHA (CAUTION Come here at your own risk)",0.8647
26-Jul-23,"Our first visit (weekly girlfriend lunch)  but we will definitely be back! What a great experience! The owner Oulay was so nice and guided us through the different dishes! She brought out samples of a few of the stews and soups so we could find our favorites and we certainly did! The Red Snapper was amazing and the ox tail soup was rich and fall off the bone tender! We alternated sides so we got to try salad, Jollof rice and fufu and they were wonderful accompaniments! Can't forget the plantains and the okra stew which were also delicious! We will be eating leftovers for a few days but I can't recommend this place enough! So many flavors to experience! A must try for foodies! Thank you Oulay for your kindness and attention to detail!  Oh, and almost forgot to mention the great vegan/ vegetarian choices which lets me come again with my vegan husband. Looking forward to visiting again!",0.9959
25-Jul-23,The food at this restaurant is amazing. It is a must have when you come to Vegas. The people here are very genuine and will explain the whole menu to you. Friendly environment and an overall 10/10!,0.807
22-Jul-23,"This place is amazing! Really great vibes and music, and the servers are really friendly. We had the fried plantains and the Oxtail Stew with Fufu! I'll definitely be back to try the empanadas and the jollof rice",0.943
21-Jul-23,"Food was mid. $30 for 3 oxtails, one carrot and half a potato. Fufu taste like boxed mash. I had takeout they gave me no fork/spoon/napkin. The servers were not friendly at all. My food was sitting on the counter for 30 mins until someone had asked ANOTHER customer if her name was Caylin (my name) I then interjected and that's how I got my food. Mind you I drove ONE HOUR to come here. And never coming again.",-0.3244
19-Jul-23,"Absolutely obsessed! Hubby took me here because I was dying to try African food for the past few years and we found our go-to! We are obsessed with the Jollof rice with chicken, the fufu and chicken egusi soup was good too but something you have to acquire a taste for and hubby LOVED the red snapper. The Senegambian Ice Tea is our go-to drink here and the staff is always friendly  And the music is always a great vibe. This place has become a favorite of ours!",0.9757
15-Jul-23,"First time going to Calabash and it was amazing! Sadly I forgot to take pictures of the interior- but it was clean, organized and overall beautiful decorated with amazing art pieces. The service was excellent, our waitress was so kind and understanding to me being new to trying African food. She provided popular recommendations and gave us samples so I knew what I was getting! My friend and I ordered two senegambian teas, the goat egusi stew, the oxtail soup, Jollof rice and the Fataya pies! Oh and of course fufu! Everything was sooo delicious and flavored that I didn't want to stop eating. If you're curious about fufu, there really isn't a taste to it, it's similar to the taste of mash potatoes, but the texture is like mochi. It went well with the main dishes we selected. For the fataya pies, you have a selection of protein: beef, chicken, seafood and vegetable. We went with chicken and seafood. Hands down the seafood matched well with the sauce that accompanies the pies. The seafood was a mix of crab, fish and shrimp. The pies were filled very well and fried! Such a great appetizer and would recommend! The goat egusi stew reminded me of curry, it packs a good punch with spice and the seasonings. The texture was smooth and overall enjoyed it. The oxtail is a must! The meat is so tender and fall off the bone, it's so worth the wait. The broth itself is very concentrated so recommend having it with rice, fufu or all of the above. The Jollof rice is wonderful and honestly can be eaten on its own, it has great flavor that compliments the stews when eaten together! Overall I am coming back again!",0.9986
12-Jul-23,"WSOP Day 38 - Lunch before live action. ""I asked this friendly African American dude at the table who can use the N word"" says Midwest poker bud.""And...""  I say shaking my head in disbelief.""He said ""go ahead and try'"".Calabash African Kitchen if the food of West Africa.  And while I've never been, I lust to try different cultures through their food.That said, a disclaimer.  I haven't been to any country in Africa.  I don't know the local taste beyond travel shows from adventurous eaters.  My opinions are those of a Westerner.Sooooo....Whoa, this food packs flavor!Yes to the black eyed pea fritters.  How they managed to keep the moisture and pack the huge flavor punch in these high protein  crisp balls of goodness is beyond me.For mains, definitely order a few to share.  The Oxtail stew is incredibly well braised, falling off the bone with cartilage soft enough to eat flavor bomb hits the mark.  Equally good, the peanut butter stew.  Natural peanut butter, a beautiful spice blend that is nutmeg forward makes the selected protein (fish) taste oh so good.Grilled meats are outstanding.  Most seasoned with what they call ""calabash seasoning""  This is a blend of various kinds of nutmeg that works surprisingly well with either beef, lamb, or fish (tilapia sampled).Do try the Jollof rice (tomato and root veg broth simmered rice) and the fufu (steamed cassava root paste).  Both are excellent foils to their offerings.Lots of interesting drinks.  Try the baobab juice.  Trust.Very friendly service eager to help navigate you to the best experience.Far outside what I'd consider everyday food but wow, what an experience.",0.9837
8-Jul-23,"Quality food cooked to order and the ambiance is nice and chill as well. You won't see this place empty on any day simply because the food is authentic and gives you a feeling of home. A feeling of family. ( p.s., don't forget to grab a malt drink  ).",0.6971
6-Jul-23,"We loved our dining experience at Calabash. The grilled red snapper is delicious and an absolute must! And our host Tenya (I hope I'm spelling it right), put the icing on the cake with her outstanding customer service!!!",0.9491
30-Jun-23,"First time having Senegalese food and Calabash made it such a wonderful experience. Friendly customer service, belly-warming food, and clean restaurant. Fufu (5/5) - similar to mashed potatoes w tapioca starch Jollof rice (5/5) - spiced so well, yummy Oxtail stew (5/5) - soo tender and flavorfulI'm excited to come back again and try other stews (okra, egusi, etc.) and side dishes. Btw they're also next to a cat cafe :)",0.9658
30-Jun-23,"Honestly 5/5. Some of the best oxtail I have ever had. The stew had tender oxtail and was full of spices that blended well together. This was my first time trying fufu, and it left a good impression! Soak the fufu in the stew for full flavor and eat along with the meat, carrot, and potato! The staff were friendly, as well. I would definitely come here again!",0.9681
30-Jun-23,"First, I'll start off by saying that we experienced great customer service. The waitress was very helpful. Especially being that it was our first time being at the restaurant. I ordered the Oxtail Soup with FuFu. The waitress suggested that I allow the fufu to marinate in the soup for a better taste. As I felt the fufu was too doughy and lacked flavor. It made the experience better by doing so, however, I didn't really care for the dish overall. Tons of spices but the soup lacked a balanced mild spice flavor. The oxtails could have been cooked longer to allow for a softer bite. The food was just okay. I'd rate it a 6 out of 10. Customer service however would be a 9 out of 10. The atmosphere was friendly with love African videos and music.*update: the owner needs to learn how to accept constructive criticism instead of assuming that everyone in America likes her food. In fact, I brought my left overs to my adult children (one of which is a food critic) and they most definitely were not to excited about the oxtail soup either. So now that makes 4 individuals who tasted the oxtail soup and rates it less than I did.",0.9788
29-Jun-23,"amazing food, ambiance + customer service. I ordered the egg rolls + oxtail soup with jollof rice. it was all SO good! so unfortunate there's not one in ATL.",0.4584
27-Jun-23,"Finally made my way here after being in Vegas almost 5 years and I've been MISSING OUT! This food is so good y'all. I ordered the chicken empanadas, jollof rice and oxtail stew & I promise you it's worth it. The service was amazing, I unfortunately don't remember her name but her perfume smelled amazing lol and was such a kind person!Our food was hot and timely, very chill comfort vibes. I will definitely be back!",0.9794
27-Jun-23,First off the ambiance was bomb. As soon as we walked in the DJ welcomed us in the mic and he played bomb music all night. It was our first time trying west Africa food and loved the Fufu!! The Peanut stew was good but the oxtails were better. Can't wait to come back and try the egusi!,0.8088

25-Jun-23,"We were sat fast however people were served before us that came in much later than us. our server came over with a bad fucking attitude and she proceeded to ignore the table. The whole hour that we waiting for the food, people walk thru the fucking door and were seated answer before us.  our server ignored our table the whole time keep in mind we ordered like 2 soup plates, right so yeah, fuck that server all the other girls in there are very respectful all the younger girls were in there nice respectful and kind and then the old lady of course had attitude and she ignored her table the whole time we talk to her literally twice the first time was when we ordered and then the second time is when we asked her an hour later to make a orders for to go and she had an attitude both times. first time we kind of shrugged it off  and we barely just got out of the 20 minutes fucking money. We didn't even get good service right now was eating before us and honestly I really wouldn't feel this way. If that bitch didn't have a bad attitude like that",0.453

31-May-23,"I ordered delivery from here and the food was delicious! However, they didn't close the container of sauce tightly and it spilled. The jollof rice with fish was delicious! Everything in that dish was delicious including the vegetables! I also had the grilled chicken ""Debi Afra / Suya."" It had a great grilled flavor (there were some burnt bits) but I found it a bit too salty and dry. It definitely needed that onion gravy. Still pretty good, though.",0.9689
30-May-23,Excellent food and service. The chu with beef and fufu was my favorite but everything was delicious. I also highly recommend the appetizer platter. Bring friends and try everything! The pineapple ginger drink reminded me of being back in Dominica.,0.9554
19-May-23,Not worth it.Every time you make an order they mess up your food for delivery .Yes the food is decent but I spent almost $80 on extra stew and extra beef they sent me three pieces of beef and fufu when my order clearly said extra sauce and extra beef With rice and plantaims.I don't even eat fufu so I'm royally pissed !it's always the same thing.  you can cook 1 weeks worth of food for the price ...not worth it. This is actually my fourth order the first 3 mess ups I wrote them a review that i made personal so just the owner could see but now its just now cool.,-0.8161
19-May-23,"What a great find!  This is the new ""flavor town"".  After a meeting yesterday, I came here for dinner.  There was no staff around when I walked in, so I took a seat at the bar where I knew I'd sit anyway.  In short order, a server appeared and brought me a menu.From looking online, I knew pretty much what I wanted.  I ordered the Dibi Afra / Suya which is grilled meat.  I went with chicken.  You get one side with this dish and the server suggested I'd like the jollof rice.  As she walked away, she turned and asked if I wanted an appetizer.  I decided I'd ordered enough already and I was almost correct.In waiting for the main course, I started with a glass of baobab juice which is quite refreshing especially on a 95+ degree day.  I watched the African music and dancing on the TV--straight in front of me at the bar.In a short time--you need to wait a bit as some things are made to order--the server arrived with my meal.  I just looked at the large mound of jollof rice.  That's one large portion for a ""side.""  The chicken peices were topped with onion slices that had a liquid on them.  I tried a piece of onion and it was super!  The spices were excellent and it had a nice tang to it.  Some people might think it's a bit too hot, but I liked it.  The grilled chicken also had great spice on it.  The rice was good and certainly filling.  The chicken is not boneless so you will need extra napkins to clean your hands.  After such a fine meal, how can you leave without getting dessert?  I didn't want anything I could get somewhere else so I ordered the chakri, the only African dessert on the menu.  When my server brought it, I became wide eyed because it's a very large bowl.  She smiled and said I could take home what I didn't finish. The menu describes chakri as millet/couscous, dehydrated golden raisins, sweet cream, and coconut flakes.  The texture is very smooth, somewhat like a creamy yogurt.  It is a little sweet.  The toppings added to the enjoyment of the dish.  A good dessert and a good one to share.Service was excellent.  My server was very friendly and always had a broad smile.  The room was quiet save for the low music.  I will come back and try some other things.  It is a bit pricey.",0.9976
16-May-23,"Good food, good service, good ambiance. The music had me wanting to get up and dance. The Fufu tastes like mashed potatoes (delicious) & I had the egusi with beef. Some said it's pricey, but neither my friend nor I were able to finish the serving. It's very filling. Also had the black eyed pea fritters, kind of like a hush puppy. Wasn't expecting it to be light & airy. I would eat it again.",0.6606
9-May-23,"Great food, friendly staff, quick service! Had the appetizer platter, fufu, oxtail stew, lamb and goat stew and all were chef's kiss!! Meat was super flavorful and cooked to perfection. Will be back to try the other stew as there are so many options.",0.9616
7-May-23,"My wife and I aren't from Vegas we're out here from Cali but since we had a family vacation I have been wanting to try this place for over 2 months after finding them on TikTok !! We got there a couple of minutes before they opened and walking in we were welcomed, and the ambiance was very beautiful The customer service was amazing. At first we were supposed to come here just to try the oxtail stew with FuFu! But my wife seeing that they had an option for grilled or fried red snapper! So we ended up getting all of that plus chicken empanadas and plantains with a ice tea drink !! I just want to say that everything was amazing the whole experience, and when we come back out here again, I swear it feels like we will be eating that every single day ! This will be our new favorite spot! Thank you again for the experience, and we will definitely be back!!!",0.9896
5-May-23,"This is a very clean and beautiful wholesome restaurant. Customer service was phenomenal. They even let you test the soups that you would like to try to see if you want to purchase it. I like that. The wait wasn't that long. I enjoyed the wait, because they where playing good Nigerian music video's, good music the accent with them singing is so soothing. The Food was so tasty really good I really enjoyed myself. The seasoning was so different and delicious. I will definitely be going back trying more dishes",0.9781

5-May-23,"Visited this restaurant for lunch. Simply wonderful. The Mafe-Domoda aka Peanut Butter Stew, made me feel good inside. Such a good dish with great flavors. Enough to taste the peanut butter but not overwhelming. It was My first time trying this dish. I'm looking forward to returning and trying other items on the menu. The restaurant has a bar with a small selection of beer, wine, and liquor but enough to cover the basics. The employees are professional and friendly. Very good service. Will definitely return.",0.9612

3-May-23,"I'm way past due for posting a review of Calabash. I have been a delighted customer for about half a year now. Oulay, the owner is the most charming woman and takes great pride in her food and in sharing her culture. I absolutely love the staff, the ambience, and of course the food. You have to get the seafood empanadas as your appetizer. Just do it and thank me later. The peanut butter stew is always going to be incredible and if you bring it home it reheats very well the next day. The jollof rice is a must if you are visiting and I suggest the fried plantains. If you never had fufu before don't be shy. Just ask and they will gladly help you and show you the ropes. For refreshments, I highly suggest the Baobab juice. It is a superfood which sadly we don't hear enough about and the taste is truly one of a kind. I could suggest so many of the menu items because I have made so many visits and I take my friends and family there regularly. If you have never had African food, this is the place to go and be sure to bring a nice group to enjoy the fantastic food.",0.9937
2-May-23,Great food and service. Meat is halal. Ambience is unique style. Definitely recommended.,0.8225
2-May-23,"Place was clean, staff was friendly and food was decent. We had a new waitress (her first day) and she didn't know anything about the menu. Employees should taste every dish on the menu, let alone know what they're serving to the customers. I'll definitely refer this place and try it again!Edit for owner:The waitress straight up said she hasn't tried anything on the menu and it was her first day. So I'm not making assumptions that your staff hasn't tried anything. She verbally told me she hasn't tried anything or didn't know if certain dishes were spicy. I'll definitely come back and try again! Thanks!",0.9211
30-Apr-23,Looking for the best African food in town ? Definitely check out Calabash African Kitchen. They have a way variety of dish cooked in a very authentic African style. Good selection on alcoholic drinks and beverages. variety on appetizers and desserts. The service is always friendly and efficient. I keep going back. Oulay!,0.9441
30-Apr-23,"My sister and I tried Calabash based on a Tik Tok video she saw for their Oxtail soup. They offered us samples of some soups and stews, which was unique and nice. I will be going back just to have another stew based on the sample. We had the Oxtail soup/stew and the Goat Pepper soup. Both were great. But... if you don't really like black pepper don't get the goat. If you do (I do) then you will be pleased. The oxtail didn't exactly fall off the bone, but you don't need a knife. Spoon is good enough. However... the broth to the Oxtail is a show stopper. I mean really, really good. One of those flavors that you will remember long after the the day has ended. The service was wonderful. Even though they had a large party event, we never lacked for service. The ladies were fantastic. I can't comment on the ambiance much because they had the whole place rearranged for this large party. But we were quite comfortable. A tall gentleman who I assume is at least one of the owners, made a point to come over and greet us and have a pleasant conversation. If your looking for Oxtail, goat or any unique stew and soups, I highly recommend you track this place down and enjoy some authentic SENEGAMBIA flavors. I am coming back for the red stew as well.",0.995
29-Apr-23,"Fantastic place, food is fairly priced, very unique, authentic, the indoor space itself is very modern and organized, we first ordered take out but came a second time to dine in. Highly recommend trying at least once. The Jollof rice is what we got and is great",0.9125

The ambiance was relaxing with a little party vibe, the place was clean and also really spacious. The food was great and was way better than what we had expected. Each dish was packed with flavor and soo much meat, not to mention their spice level took me by a little surprise. Overall my friend and I had a great first time experience and hope there will be many more when we're back in Vegas again.",0.9929

16-Apr-23,"My youngest daughter has been asking to try to place out because she is a big fan of none other Keith lee food blogs and reviews. Upon checking all the yelp reviews we finally gave in and decided to give it a try. We ordered it ahead to go for dinner today and spent $75.61 for some Ox Tail soup w fufu, Beef Peanut butter stew w fufu, Jollof rice on the side and some order of fried plantains. When we got there my husband said customer service was not ehh ok the lady who he spoke w seemed like she was in a bad mood, food was not completely ready so he came back out and waited in the car and waited another 10 mins. When he got back to the car I can see the poor packaging on the soups they could have atleast wrapped the plastic containers in plastic like other places does so it doesn't leak out the lid I mean he literally just got in the car and I can see it leaking thru but we only live 18 mins away so I just held it in my lap. For $75 you would think you can feed a family of 4-6 but portions are way too small for the price you pay. When I got everything opened the oxtail soup literally has 2 oxtails in it,no potatoes or carrots like some videos you see literally just 2 pcs of oxtails for $28 we all tried it and yeah the flavor is there but it ain't worth the $,it also left a weird after taste after eating it. The beef peanut butter stew was disappointing the beef was hard and chewy that even my teenagers couldn't eat it, i think there was like 7 small piece of hard small meat in it and the flavor was nothing special not for $22.The Jollof rice is dry and for $8 it's really only good for 1 person. The plantains were $8 for like 6pcs and is probably only the best out of everything we ordered that all of us agreed on. Fufu was fufu it don't taste like anything it's just like a rolled up unflavored mash potatoes and if you are a texture person probably not for you. We are all about supporting small business specially when it comes to good food but Was it worth the $$$??? definitely not it's overpriced! So safe to say even my daughter who has been wanting to try this place we will not be back. What u see in the picture is literally what we got :(",0.9849
16-Apr-23,Great and friendly service . Very quick and efficient dining . Lovely and welcoming people!,0.9542
14-Apr-23,The place is very clean. Staff is very friendly. The empeñadas were very good. The lamb was very good. It tasted like it was fresh off the grill. I know everyone goes there for the egusi and fufu. The fufu is plain which is the point. I didn't really like the egusi. It has a mineral taste to it. I want to come back and order the fish and ox tail soup. This place is very expensive.,0.9611
13-Apr-23,"Under the influenceI've been interested in expanding my palate for a while now and under the influence of Keith Lee and Tallz Calabash was very easy to consider. The vegetarian/vegan menu offers a variety of  choices including fried plantains! Did I mention how delicious the plantains are. I ordered vegetarian ""Soup Kanja"" also known as okra stew and fufu + plantains side order. I'm no stranger to okra and this stew soup did not disappoint. Fufu is an interesting  addition and will definitely take some getting use to.The ambiance is bright and fresh and the service was fast. Servers are extremely attentive. I ordered to and I look forward to going back soon!",0.963
9-Apr-23,"Fantastic ambiance and music. I really enjoyed the vibe. One thing that was a bit of a bother was that we were sitting right in front of the DJ/speaker which made the music really loud and made it hard for us to have a conversation without raising our voices. The food was good, I was happy that there were vegan/vegetarian options and my son in law wanted to try the oxtail stew, so that was one of the main reasons why we wanted to try this place. The service was friendly however the wait for the food was pretty long, maybe 20-30 minutes. When my okra stew was served, it wasn't hot or even warm at all. Overall, I enjoyed the food, service and music. I will probably come back again and try sometime different off the vegan/vegetarian menu. However visiting this place will be a once in a while thing as it is a bit pricey. This is a great place to try if you want to try something unique and different from the usual everyday recipes.",0.9804

7-Apr-23,"My friend told me about this place so we both decided to check it out, driving  over 30 minutes from Henderson. It's nicely decorated, very hip and modern with a blend of African designs throughout. We were both starving so we ordered meat pies as appetizers, and I ordered jollof and oxtail as my entree. I was pleasantly surprised by the food portions! I couldn't even finish it and had to bring it home and finally finished it in 2 days. Food was flavorful, service was great. My only suggestion is to install a small check- in podium near the entrance to welcome people as they come in. I hope you're around for a long time and continue to flourish. I'll definitely be back.",0.9652
2-Apr-23,"Tried this place for dinner with my family and it was amazing. It was recomended by a friend so I thought Ill give it a try. Ive never tried African cuisine and had no idea it was all delicious! We tried a few dishes but really loved the oxtail with fufu, and empenada appetizer. Cant wait to return and try more of the menu. Great food, Great aptmosphere, Great staff.",0.9838
28-Mar-23,"OMG! What a completely satisfying and delicious experience . My first visit on a Tuesday evening proved to be one of my best dining experiences in my city Las Vegas . My partner enjoyed the red snapper and the oxtail stew . So much flavor and cooked to perfection . I tried fufu for the first time and it was like nothing I had ever had before . Definitely recommend you try it and get some plantains for the appetizer . The restaurant was 3/4 full with a steady stream of to go orders . Our server NeNe was pleasant , courteous and very informative on the various menu selections. The portions were oversized - yes to go boxes to enjoy later . Calabash is a nice addition to the Vegas culinary circle . 5 stars all around !",0.9912
25-Mar-23,Super cute clean restaurant. We're visiting from Hawaii. My daughter found this place on Tiktok & wanted to give it a try. We walked in to order take out. Service was subpar. Seems like the workers were all over the place like they didn't know what they're doing. We walked in someone greeted us asked if we are eating in or picking up take out. I told her we wanted to order take out and asked to look at a menu. She handed the menu and walked away to the back. When we was ready to order another person helped us took our order so we waited on the side. 30 minutes go by I saw what looked like our order that was sitting on the counter for almost 10mins already so I walked up to ask another worker if our order was ready. He checked and it was! There was 2 small parties and a few tables but it wasn't that busy. We got the oxtail soup stew with fufu & chakery dessert. The food was good oxtail a little spicy but good. If we come back to Vegas I'd love to give them another try. They just need to work on being more attentive to detail & maybe just one worker should help the customer till the service is complete.,0.9846
23-Mar-23,I'm super anxious about trying new things but this place was really good. The service is SUPER SLOW so please don't drop in when you're in a hurry.,0.9623

16-Mar-23,"A Wednesday, around 4pm. Our first time here. I've seen coverage on the news, and many Instagram reviews. It's in an older looking strip mall. It looked closed, but we saw the ""Open"" sign.  Not many of the places on the lot looked inviting.  Had I not seen the reviews that I have seen, I would not have gone in.It's very clean and orderly inside.  No ""Wait to be seated"" sign. We just stood there until someone yelled ""Hello"".  We both said ""Hello""; and the young lady looked at us with the expression, like she was saying ""And.......???!!"" My friend said to me, ""Are we missing a sign or something????.....Do we just sit?""  He then asked ""This is our first time.....do we just seat ourselves?"" She grabbed a couple of menus and we were seated.  I already knew what I wanted after watching the reviews.  I got the oxtail stew with fufu and we both got the  Fataya (Chicken) and my friend got the Cheb-Bu-Jen and he got the pineapple ginger drink.  Everything was fresh and thoroughly seasoned well.  I was expecting fall off the bone oxtails. Sadly, they were absolutely delicious however, a little tough and chewy. I think because it was a fresh batch, after their ""Closed/Off"" days, so I completely understand. It was very flavorful. The little meat pies were delicious too. Served with a dipping sauce that tasted like roasted red peppers.  My friend cleaned his plates!!! ALL OF IT!!!! And it was a lot of food!  I didn't order a drink with my meal, I was going to get one to go. My friend asked if we could sample the tea.  I asked if I could taste it too.   We were brought one teeny 1oz sauce container of tea. I think that the waitress was probably told not to bring us more than one. But I informed her that he and I are not a couple...... (come on, with COVID..... I've never had it.....he has......) she didn't bring another sample, so I didn't get anything to go. Our waitress was a sweetheart.  Very bright and bubbly. She knew the menu and the entrée ingredients.  I want to say that her name is Amelia.  Kicking myself for not remembering...... but I was thirsty (LOL). She said that she had been working there since September.  I asked her to keep that energy. More establishments need employees like her. So, I highly recommend this place.  I'll be back!  My friend said that he would also. And that says a lot; because he's picky.",0.9972
15-Mar-23,"Came into town and was immediately on the hunt for some West African food and came across Calabash on Yelp. Seeing the pictures it was an immediate yes. We came in on a Tuesday at lunch time and it wasn't crowded at all. The decor was just so warm and vibrant and beautifully done. We ordered the sampler of all the appetizers to start which came with 4 (different) empanadas, egg rolls, plantains and black eyed pea fritters which paired with 3 sauces. Empanadas were crispy on the outside with a buttery flavor; favorite flavor was the chicken followed by the beef, seafood and last veggies. They were all flavored so well. The fritters were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Plantains perfectly ripe and not too sweet - perfectly fried. This appetizer plate is huge. I might have underestimated the size cuz your girl was getting full before the main course. We brought a friend with us whom had not tried west African before. She was a little scared and couldn't decided between two items but the staff was so sweet and brought us 4 little samplers of their stew so she could try and make a better decision. I mean come on that was just some awesome service. We ended up getting the Red stew ""Chu"", Red Snapper attieke and oxtail stew with Jollof rice. I can't say which is my favorite because each plate that came out was so good. The red stew so flavorful, with a some sweetness from tomatoes with the perfect amount of heat. The oxtail was ""fall off the bone"" delicious and pouring the flavorful stew on top of the jollof rice...yum! The fish was crispy and tender with the onion confit and attieke. We couldn't have asked for a better meal or experience. 12 out of 10. That extra 2 points is because the plates were so big. I've had leftovers for breakfast and lunch. I will def be back for more.",0.9946
12-Mar-23,I love this place and the food is delicious. I always get outstanding service and the music and ambiance keeps me coming back for more.,0.9169
11-Mar-23,"This was my first experience of African cuisine and boy oh boy was I in for a treat!I ordered takeout - the woman at the restaurant was lovely and gave me an explanation of the menu items, as it was all alien to me. She recommended the oxtail stew with fufu, so I took it. I love meat, spice and carbs. Ideal. The meal cost $30, so a bit pricey, but I could see why. You get a 32oz container full of stew - 3 oxtail pieces, carrots and potatoes. The fufu came wrapped in plastic wrap - i was told I needed to slap the fufu for tradition....so i did. The fufu was fine. It tasted like unseasoned mash potatoes, but the purpose is not to eat it alone - it is to dip in the stew. So I did this and just wow. The fufu carried the flavor just like pasta would...and the flavor was BIG. The stew was deep, meaty and a little spicy. I love spice and it could have done with a bit more in my opinion. But it was delcious regardless. The vegetables were soft, and the oxtail...just wow. The meat was rich and fell of the bone. You get 3 big hunks of oxtail. For $30, I was stuffed at the end of it, so it was worth the money.",0.9914
10-Mar-23,"A place was very nice and beautiful, I ordered 3 fufu with peanut stew and egusi soup. Total come out to 59 dollar plus 17.45 tips I end up tipping so around 71 dollar will get you a lot of food. I am happy with my order but one thing I am not Happy about is the quality of the meat  in my soup. I've been to other African restaurants the meat was tenderized and it's easy to pull apart this meat here almost pull my tooth off. But overall I am happy but please tenderize your meat ! Trust me you'll have more better results. I would like to give it 3/5 but I am not going to be mean over meat so here you go with fair solid 4/5.",0.9852
9-Mar-23,"I really enjoyed the vibe, the music and most definitely the food and service! You know the food is good when you're constantly dancing in your seat haha. Nane was an amazing waitress and so sweet. Thank you all.",0.9727
8-Mar-23,"My daughters have been bugging me to try fufu! So I reached out to my Kenyan friend and she suggested Calabash African Kitchen...and I am so glad I did! Here's what we ordered:BLACK EYE PEAS FRITTERS: you HAVE to get it. We tried it without the onion first. I really liked it without but when I dipped it in the onion sauce it took it to a different level. Warning, the onion sauce is spicy but so good. My 9 year old daughter preferred it with the onion sauce. She kept the onion sauce on the table throughout the meal and dipped the oxtail meat in it too.OXTAIL STEW/SOUP: WHOA!!! My favorite from the entire meal. There is a slight spice to it but it didn't stop us from killing it. My friend recommended us to have our oxtail with the fufu, and she was not wrong. The oxtail was delicious with both the fufu and the rice. There were so much bold flavors in the oxtail. We ordered another oxtail to go to feed the rest of the family that didn't come with us.CHICKEN EGUSI SOUP WITH FUFU: This was good but was definitely a flavor to get used to. The bitter melon flavor is different. I did notice that when I ate more of it, the more I got used to the flavor and it was good. My 9 year old tried it and she kept trying it but still couldn't get use to the bitter melon flavor. I would suggest to at least try it once. And don't forget to eat it with the fufu!And not to forget.. everything tastes better when you eat it all with your fingers! MUST TRY! GO!",0.9914
7-Mar-23,"I've been craving for some Nigerian food and found this place. This place is clean and not too far from Summerlin. We ordered Pepper soup, Egusi, Jollof rice, plantains and cocktails a couple of weeks ago. Everything was delicious!!! Although the wait was long, I'm hoping they figure out a quicker way to serve. I went back to take our cousin who is visiting from Ireland about a week ago and I ordered the Okra stew and it was yummy as well. Spoke to the owner for a little bit and she was nice and welcoming. I had already ordered from Postmates over the weekend. You can tell I love their food!",0.9771
5-Mar-23,"Understanding that they were just in the local news and also in a Food magazine, I expected a wait. But somehow the ambiance was amazing.The vibe you get when you walk in the door, music playing, tables full, staff smiling tells you to leave your BS at the door, this is not time or place for it. I also overheard that the owner actually prepares all the food herself, I sat at the bar completely patient. (My name means honor will come with patience) so seeing the prepared plates pass by me and waiting for my turn, I knew I was about to be blessed.I ordered fried plantain, and akarra to eat in restaurant and Oxtail Soup with fufu to take home. Did not disappoint. Reminded me of the akarra I make myself. So excited to share this place with friends and family visiting Las Vegas. My server Moriah was superb.*Remember this is not a fast food restaurant good food takes time. Good Luck Calabash. I'll be back with my crew next time!",0.9904

27-Feb-23,"The food is very good!  I got Oxtail Stew w/a side of Jollof rice, Egusi soup w Goat and Fufu, and Lamb Chops with Plantains.  Food is at least 4 stars.  The price is a bit expensive for the amount of food you get.  The food was so good, if the price was a bit more reasonable, I'd be there once, if not twice, a week.  This fed two people with very little left for later.  I spent $112 including tip at 15% for take out.  At this price it's definitely a novelty and not necessity for me.",0.8548
26-Feb-23,"Wonderful, flavorful, and plentiful food. Our server was knowledgeable,  helpful and clearly understood her job. The drinks were excellent.

26-Feb-23,"The hype is real...Sunday afternoon around 1 pm for a table of two and it was almost halfway full of people. We were greeted and seated right away. Clean spacious and light restaurant. We ordered after about 5-7 min of looking at the menu. Waited about 15 min before the food came out.Food: ($27) oxtail soup/stew with fufu. I asked for spicy and it had a kick to it just the right amount too! Oh my, the flavor was amazing. I had like 3 good sizes of oxtail in there with a potato slice and carrot slice. More than enough! Most of the oxtail was tender and easily fell off the bone--yum! Fufu was fresh and soup was hot. My new fav! Only thing is I ordered rice with it but it came out with fufu- a mistake which honestly was for the better haha. Get fufu y'all. My husband got the ($25) egusi soup with beef. It's a thicker soup and came with fufu. After devouring it he said it had a bitter taste to it which kind of reminds him of bitter melon (this is good, not bad). I honestly didn't notice the bitter taste but again these flavorful spices were so worth it! We were trading bowls and stealing each others food ;) There was a DJ spinning music and the whole experience was so fun! Dress up or go casual, hold a B-day dinner or date night here. We plan on coming back! Thank you to our nice server as well!",0.9879

24-Feb-23,Okay first off I'm going to start by saying this is my new favorite restaurant in the entire world. The food is soo good that I can taste my mothers kitchen lol. I'm Gambian so finding a senegambian restaurant in vegas that is actually good and very close to home or is home is something special to me. The staff is great it's soo clean in there and the ambiance is just amazing. I wil definitely be coming 2x or more a week because I've missed the taste of home so much and that's what they gave me.

21-Feb-23,"Food is amazing, but service is terrible. Really wanted to have a good experience here. Sat down and waited almost two hours for our food. I understand they were busier than usual but nobody even came to check on us until I waived someone down an hour in. I was then told by our waitress that they were working on the food and it would be coming soon until she came back and said that they actually hadn't started working on the food yet. The food was great but I wouldn't have came if I knew it would have taken 2 hours. I would consider takeout but saw people were waiting excessively long for their takeout orders too. I'm less upset with the wait than I am the service, though. It would have been nice if our waitress had warned us about the long wait time, checked on us, or even refilled our water once in the 2 hours we were waiting. I'd consider coming back if there's significant improvement in service here.",0.9192
20-Feb-23,"Long wait to get seated 30mins, long wait to get food 1 1/2 hour. Oxtail soup $27 for 2 piece of tough meat that was small is ridiculous. Felt like my family and I got robbed. Did not want to complain and wait any longer for food. We just won't ever come back.",0.0997
20-Feb-23,"Seen this place on tik tok so me and the family was very excited to eat here but this place was disappointing. Waited over 1 1/2 hour. We had to ask how long more for the food, come to find out they didn't put the order in and our server left but we got our food 20 mins later. The food was ok, it was a bit salty but tolerable. The whole time we were waiting, no water and no check up on us. I understand a place is busy but this was ridiculous.***Update to respond to owner***I didn't log into 2 accounts.

19-Feb-23,"This was such a great find! It's tucked away in a random small strip mall. The service was so friendly and helpful in deciding what dish was best suited for us. We settled for a few things to share and try. We had the empanadas (1 beef, 1 chicken). The chicken was by far the superior one to me. We had the egg rolls which were my actual favorite dish. We had a side of Jollof Rice and the oxtail stew with fufu. Every single thing was delicious. The portions are very generous. The oxtail was so good as was the rice. We will definitely be back. There's so much more I want to try!",0.9908
19-Feb-23,"I'm going straight to the food bec I can't contain myself. TLDR: everything is delicious!Hibiscus juice - refreshing and sweet!Ginger pineapple juice - If you enjoy ginger shots, you'll love this. Spicy with just a little bit of sweetness from the pineapple. Fataya pie - so good! Tried 1 beef and 1 chicken, and I have zero complaints. The meat were flavorful and moist. I was surprised at how flaky and sturdy the crust was considering the meats inside were so juicy. And paired with their sauce, simply chef's kiss! Akara (black eyed pea fritters with a savory onion sauce) - simple, perfectly fried, and tasty! But that sauce... that sauce is really good! I literally googled Akara onion sauce while eating because I needed to know what was in it and why it was hitting so good.Egusi soup - our server offered a sample to try before I ordered this since some people who order it realize it's not their cup of tea. I appreciated this so much bec tbh, I didn't recognize most of the ingredients in this soup. I don't know what egusi seeds are. I saw hot pepper seasoning and bitter leaves and knew I had to have it. And let me tell you, it was delicious! You'll taste a little bitterness in the beginning, then get hit with a wave of flavors, spices, and heat. Amazing! I don't know what to compare it too. I ordered it with fufu but I found myself eating it with rice. Oxtail stew with rice - you can't go wrong with oxtail. If you can't decide on what to eat here, pick the oxtail soup! The soup is flavorful and the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender. And they give you good portions, plenty of meat and rice.Jollof rice with lamb - lamb was well-seasoned, fork-tender, and moist. I've never had jollof rice before and I loved the texture and flavor.The vibes are there. They have a great DJ. The service was friendly from the moment we walked in. The service can be on the slower slide but it didn't bother us. Just chill, vibe, enjoy the music, live slowly. What a gem of a place!",0.996

First time having peanut butter stew and it was tasty I decided to pair it up with the fufu. Upon initial walk in we only saw a couple of people and towards the evening it became a full house, the waitress was very helpful explaining to us the dishes and what is ordered the most also giving us some pointers on how to eat the fufu. Really small on the outside but once you are inside the place is big and they have some good tunes in the background. Highly recommend to go check it out.

My partner had the shawarma (chicken) and couscous. He said he could eat the shawarma every day. We shared the plantains and those were good too.

25-Jan-23,"My first time trying African food and I was blown away! I've always been scared because of movie depiction on how spicy it could be. But these are flavorful spices but hot spices that hurt.We ordered Egusi, Oxtails, Burber, and Jollof! I was pleasantly surprised by all the flavors. I had to ask how to use the Fufu to eat and they were super friendly and showed me how. Don't skip out in their drinks too! The juice and tea are divine!They have live music on Sunday, perfect with friends or family. I'm so happy I found out about Calabash!",0.9884
22-Jan-23,"The cleanliness could be better however the food was very tasty. The Ginger Pineapple drink was off the chain and I would mimic that at home if could. The empanadas were very good. I prefer the beef over chicken. The Peanut Stew was good, it did taste a little nutty but not sweet. The Cassava Leaf stew was my favorite! So much flavor and very tasteful!",0.7584

17-Jan-23,First time trying African cuisine and it was so good. The staff was friendly and the food was great. I had oxtail stew and fufu and it was out of this world. The fufu has a flavor profile of a potato. Very simple base to carry the stew. The stew was a little spicy and had great flavor. The oxtail just fell off the bone. Would return 100% and I can't wait to try more.,0.9446
15-Jan-23,"Amazing. From the cool atmosphere to the friendly staff and delicious food. We have never had West African food before but they made fans of us. My kids had seen fufu on TikTok and wanted to try it. Finally found something positive from the platform!  Goat, Casava and Peanut stew with lamb were so flavorful. There was a nice selection of African drinks too. Definitely give it a try and go with someone you can share with!",0.972

31-Dec-22,"We walked in and immediately was greeted with a warm welcome. We got to pick where we wanted to sit and shortly was given water and menus. It was our first time trying this cuisine so we didn't know what to expect. So we ended up ordering a bit of everything. Fried plantains, fish empanadas, and the black eyed pea fritters. Food didn't take too long for appetizers, I'd say about 10 minutes or so. Immediately got down to business because we were starving but as soon as we started we had fallen in love with the food. I would say the fish empanadas are a must try! They do have other choices of filling but the fish was really good. For the main course we had ordered the lamb and Jollof rice, egusi soup, and the oxtail stew. Which didn't take too long of a wait as well. My favorite had to be the oxtail stew, my goodness was it amazing. Everything was so flavorful and tasty.",0.98

16-Dec-22,"12/15/22, if I could give more than 5 stars I would. The minute you walk in you're greeted warmly, the atmosphere is great with the afrobeats video's playing in the background..  The owner explained the menu and gave us samples of the African wine. The food is very tasty and the spice just right. We ordered the empanadas, which was delicious. fried plantain just the way I love them. Jollof  rice with chicken and  caramelized onions which took this dish out of this world. Lastly we ordered egusi soup and fufu. I will definitely be returning to this Gem of a place. I would rate this place 11/10. I was too busy eating to taking pic. Try this place out you won't regret it.",0.9707
