10-Dec-22,"12/11/22 *Updated* - I am updating my review to 5 stars based on the OUTSTANDING customer service I received from Oulay the owner (Keith Lee was right, the customer service here is fire!!). Per my previous review I had an issue with my order, however Oulay immediately contacted me after my post and corrected the issue expeditiously. I am honestly amazed! I will now eat here as often as I possibly can and continue to spread the word to my friends and family and on Tiktok and I will add updated pics after my next dining experience at Calabash. Thank you again Oulay!I visited Calabash on Sat Dec 10th based on Keith Lee's Tiktok review and a few other reviews I'd seen. There are definitely some pros and cons which I will list below. Pros:1. I thought the 30 min wait time for my to go order was reasonable. 2. Generally the food was very flavorful and delicious and had an appreciate level of spiciness.3. The restaurant was very clean and modern inside. Cons:1. I ordered jollof rice with chicken (per my receipt pictured), I received jollof rice without chicken (per picture), but was charged $21 which is the price with chicken. Extremely frustrating. As other reviews have mentioned, check your to go orders throughly - open every box to ensure its what you ordered. 2. The oxtails were good, albeit very expensive ($27 for 3 small oxtails in a stew). However they were more fatty than oxtails I've had at other spots in Vegas. The stew was amazing though.",0.9722
10-Dec-22,Freaking Fresh and fantastic.  Pleasant atmosphere too. The food was so savory. I will definitely be back......live music on Sundays 1-close,0.8542

5-Dec-22,"My daughter and I wanted to try other culture foods . We found this place and decided to try . Upon arriving we were greeted by 2/3 women .

24-Nov-22,"What a hidden gem. I visited for the first time not knowing what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised by the bright interior and spacious seating. My friend and I perused the menu and our lovely waiter helped us on picking what to get. We went with the egusi soup w/ fufu and jollof rice with plantains.I personally enjoyed the jollof more. It was very flavorful and the plantains were cooked perfectly. It came with this stewed onion and chili sauce which was AMAZING! I would order this again in a heartbeat. Unlike any other rice dish you've had.The egusi was really good, too! It has a slight bitter taste and the texture is almost like soft scrambled eggs. I enjoyed the taste but I think it can be a hit or miss for people.I will be coming back to Calabash, 100%!",0.9468

6-Oct-22,"OMG- This place is stunning! Everything about it was 5 star. The ecstatics, the music, the food, the service. They have some of the friendliest staff in the valley. The culture oozes out of every corner! You can tell whoever designed this place put effort and thought into the process. The food was amazing. The ingredients were pure. The meat was fresh and tender. The Fufu was BOMB! We will definitely be coming back for more!",0.9445
3-Oct-22,"Yooo!! Me and my friends came out to Vegas on a spontaneous trip from California. One of us was like ""hey have y'all ever had fufu or African food before? Obviously none of had but being Cambodians we are open minded and wanted to try something new because the good folks on Instagram be making it look good. Anyways per usual we went on yelp, searched African food and after a few failed attempts at some other run downs joints we stumbled upon Calabash. The reviews and picture were much nicer than the rest that we physically attempted to dine at(I'm not going to tell y'all which we went to ones because I believe pictures and 3 stars reviews are not always true) upon arrival the restaurant is positioned somewhat in the corner of a fairly nice strip mall/shopping plaza located out west of vegas strip area take the drive trust us. The drive was about 10-15 minutes or so on city streets. We all went inside the place had modern layout. Nice and clean, tables laid out nice, African murals and painting. The servers wore traditional African outfits and the the service was outstanding! Oh yeah come on a Sunday because the DJ was playing us African music so the ambiance was lit! with the vibes we felt inside this establishment the food had to be top notch right? You are F**king correct! It was amazing and every dish we ordered, all had very flavorful distinct taste and textures. African food turned us out man. You think I'm leave a long review if the place wasnt good? LOL! Don't take my word for it just go  get your fufu and that bomb.com African food fix out yo mind right now and head towards Calabash African kitchen when in Vegas or if you already live in Vegas!!",0.9941

30-Sep-22,I am a VERY harsh critic of food. This was beyond amazing. I spend a lot of money on food and I am a proud foodie. The service was fast and friendly. I sincerely hope you all stay in good business. This will be in my weekly rotation. I am a cook and I do not play about food. This is up to par with what I would cook. Great job!,0.9366
23-Sep-22,"WOW. This was our reaction to every single thing at this restaurant. From the decor, to the service, and the food! Our first experience with African food was better than we imagined! As soon as we walked in we loved how clean and beautiful it was inside. Chicken and beef empanadas were so flavorful you don't even need to dip in the sauce but it was too delicious not to. Plantains, cooked to perfection. You HAVE to try the Jollof Rice.My Egusi Soup with chicken had the perfect amount of spice. Wonderful textures in every bite. I could eat fufu everyday now. My girlfriend ordered the chicken Yassa and cleaned those bones as she should. It came with a pepper sauce on the side that I wish I could order in a bottle! This place was perfect for our date night. I've already told my friends and family about it and can't wait to return!",0.9934

16-Sep-22,"Mixed review. The taste was amazing, spicy but great! What got me questioning my decision to go back was definitely the portion size. I've been to the one in Cali, that is double the size in fufu and double the size in container for less than what I paid for here. The excuse of it costing more because of the ingredients. Is just that, an excuse. Maybe reach out to your neighboring state and see where they get their ingredients from.",0.9238

28-Aug-22,First time here and I decided to try mafe domoda with fufu and I got fried plantains on the side. The flavors were delicious. I got a hint of spice while eating the soup. The fried plantains were delicious. Good balance of fried and sweet. Definitely going back to try the egusi soup.,0.9432
24-Aug-22,"I really really want to give a 5 star. But I can't. This is why. The quantity of the food is minimal for the price.So laziness really brought me here, my son wanted grandma's cooking and I surely wasn't going to slave in the kitchen after almost 10hrs at work. I called and placed an order of jollof rice with beef and fufu with egusi soup. It came to a whooping $54 and change. I was already having 2nd thoughts but thought I would just give them a try. So I did. When I arrived there, my food was in the back. So the lady at the front went to get it. As soon as I saw my food, I regretted it. I just knew there was an issue with portion size. I paid and left. Upon getting home, I was pleasantly surprised that the egusi was a good portion. Still small but enough for at least 2 servings. The fufu was small. I can't imagine it would fill up a typical African male...so what in the actual what? On to the jollof rice.. it was half of the container...half. I have never ever ever ordered food and gotten a half container. How, why, what, when, who? So confused .  $25 worth of rice and beef...half container? I left earth for a second and regained life. I felt cheated! This was and is not acceptable. So 2 stars taken for quantity and price.Now let's talk about the taste. As you can see, no photos taken of the food. Well that's because it was actually finger licking good. I didn't eat it, I inhaled it. Gosh! A real taste of home. Will I return,  maybe. The price for me is scary...Quantity even more scary. Who eats here regularly?",0.6373
23-Aug-22,"My gf has been wanting to try Nigerian food.  A guest recommended this place. Did not disappoint. The food was delicious. The food took a little bit longer than expected but good things come to those that wait. Their service was great our server told us if we have any questions about the menu just ask and even recommended her favorite juices. We had the ox tail stew, the egusi with beef both with fufu and the empanadas with Senegambia iced tea and baobab juice . Everything was great packed with flavor. After we were paying the bill. One of the employees came by asked how our food was and said thank you for your patience they were down a worker. We didn't mind enjoyed the place ,decor is nice they have music with videos playing as well at just the right volume to not disturb a conversation. I highly recommend this place and I will be coming back.",0.9909

18-Aug-22,"Egusi stew/soup with fufu is the best, I've been twice love the food and service. Also try the iced tea was different than I'm used to but I really liked it.",0.8534
17-Aug-22,My friend and I have been wanting to try African food together for a long time and I wouldn't want that experience to be anywhere but here. The food was authentic and we met the owner who was simply wonderful. This was really an amazing experience and I would highly recommend if you want authentic African food and great service. Well done!,0.979
16-Aug-22,My first time trying African food. Seen it all the time on tiktok and all other social media. My honest review it is amazing the oxtail soup is to die for like juicy tender and just amazing and egusi soup is spicy but like a good spice. Also having that fufu oooooweeeee just everything together is amazing love it would definitely be coming back again. Also we added rice to the egusi soup. But anyways definitely recommend this place. Also the service was amazing the staff and everyone is friendly and the music bro makes me wanna dance love it,0.9946
4-Aug-22,"The food was incredible. I usually have complaints or minor adjustments I would make to meals at restaurants but I was pleasantly surprised to love every bite. I had the lamb Debi Afra / Suya with salad and I tried some of the Cassava Leaf Stew ""Palasas"". Amazing full flavor that wasn't overbearing. They had a full range of spices that were perfectly complimentary. I will be returning to show my friends the incredible food served here. Our waitress was overly hospitable and gave great suggestions and made the experience very nice. It felt like I was having a home meal with my ""cool aunt.""",0.9941
3-Aug-22,"I will embarrassingly admit I went on the search to try Jollof rice after it got brought up on Ted Lasso all throughout season 2. So excited that search ended me up at Calabash! Calabash and Jollof rice did not disappoint. We ordered: Fried Plantains - perfffection! hot fresh caramelized goodness Jollof Rice with Chicken - THISSS. This is a MUST, the Jollof rice and the sauteed onion sauce on the chicken. I dream of it now. Okra Soup w/ Fufu - This was different! Liked the fufu, very generous portion. Soup is gumbo-like texture. Definitely has some gamey ness from the lamb.Interior is lovely. Great music and music videos playing in the background. My server was SO sweet and nice. Excited to come back and try new dishes.",0.99
2-Aug-22,I wanted to give more stars however how much I paid and the portion I received isn't right. I feel it's good food but spicy . It's delicious. I ordered Grubhub and I saw how small the to go containers are when I received my order. My bill total was $64.27  Dang ..... I spent alot of my money on small containers of food. This isn't like that in California. Bigger containers good food. I just feel I waisted my money. However the food is delicious but spicy. I like the Peanut Stew! This is my only complaint please make your to go containers bigger you are charging enough for this size. I'm disappointed in this. California has better deals to go containers cheaper price,0.9138
28-Jul-22,"Wow! First: this place is beautiful on the inside, great attention to detail in the design. It just feels very comfortable & welcoming to everyone.I tried the peanut butter stew (mafe domoda) with fondi, a type of grain I can best describe as smaller than quinoa. It was one of the tastiest combinations of anything I've had in quite a while. Spice level was perfect. At first, I saw the portion and thought it was a bit small, but wow, it's very filling (and I'm a big guy!). Anybody looking to try something different should definitely get here.",0.9752
22-Jul-22,My first time eating African food and it was good. The fufu and egusi soup was good. Not to mention the oxtail soup and their special rice. We will definitely try other dishes in the future.,0.8807
16-Jul-22,"This was my first time eating African food and the food was beyond the scale! I came here with my friends and the environment was so fun to be around. The workers were so friendly and it truly felt like I was eating in a home setting. 100/10 and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to try African food! AND you have to try their goat pepper soup and lamb jollof rice, Sooooo good!",0.9772
16-Jul-22,"My very first time trying African food. It was amazing packed with flavor. I got the okra stew it reminded me of gumbo but all also beef stew, nonetheless it was a 10/10. In fact I think I'm going back today. The jollof rice and plantains was perfect. I also had the empanadas and even reheated in the air fryer they did not disappoint. I met the owner she was so pleasant and absolutely stunning. The restaurant aesthetic is vibrant and modern. Check it out!!!",0.9809
15-Jul-22,"A Delicious Dream is BornFIVE STARS! Review for Calabash African Kitchen, 1750 S Rainbow Blvd, Suite 8, LV, NV, Phone (702) 331-6440, on Thursday, July 14, 2022.My best food days are when I find a new little hole-in-wall restaurant with great food. If it's ethnic, that's even better. Well, I found one, but it's definitely not a ""little"" hole-in-the-wall. Looks were deceiving (please read on). Their website is titled ""A Delicious Dream is Born."" Just WOW! This one line perfectly sums it up! From the outside it looked like a small, insignificant, inconsequential ""diner"" in a kind of crummy, also small, outdoor shopping area near Rainbow and Oakey. This little shopping area had recently upgraded a small bit with the opening of an exceptionally clean, bit luxurious, coffee and snack shop in a Cat Caf√© next door. The Cat Caf√© has become a delicious add-on that was bringing new people to this little center. As we and others visited the Cat Caf√©, we couldn't help but notice what-appeared-to-be a tiny African restaurant next door, especially when Cat coffee and snacks weren't quite enough. From the outside, it really looked like a dingy little diner. We were hungry, hot, tired so what the hell, right?! Well ... count us surprised! We walked out of the insufferable heat and into another world. It turned out to be an elegant, icy cool, huge, beautiful restaurant-bar-lounge with some of the best food, music and atmosphere that we've enjoyed in a long time. (See the pictures!) The dining room was ""huge"" with a full-size bar, dozens of tables and elegant overstuffed chairs, tastefully decorated, and white glove clean! It could easily seat 50-60 people in groups as large as 12-18. The temperature inside was a nice icy 72 degrees. Over the bar was a big screen television set to a wonderfully calming music video station with a soft enticing drumbeat. The servers and bartender were beautifully (and elegantly) dressed in a burst of bright African colors and flare. My first thoughts were ""Can we afford this?"" Answer: ""Yes, you can."" And the food IS the ""delicious"" part of the dream!We sat in a booth near the front window. The service was cheerful, sweet, instant and perfect from start to end from our sweet hostess and server Rohney! For me, a great beginning at any restaurant is to find salt, pepper, and napkins readily available on the table so I don't have to ask for them (just a personal preference). Mission accomplished!This was our first experience into African food. I can't say whether it was authentic West African or not, but the spicing was damn good! We ordered Ginger Pineapple Juice ($6), Chicken Wings appetizer with Calabash spices and fries ($13), Shawarma - a huge over-stuffed burrito wrap around char-grilled meat, tomato, flavored onion and special sauce ($16), Kabob Brochette - skewered marinated meat (beef and chicken mix), bell pepper and onion pieces, all grilled and served with rice topped with a sweet onion sauce ($18). The chicken wings had an amazing flavor, were perfectly crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside, and dare we say ""the second best we've ever had"" (only to the Salt & Pepper Wings served at Circa's 8 East). The Shwarma was an overstuffed tortilla wrapped meal of excessive goodness (that we had to take half home but gobbled it again as soon as we entered the house). And the Brochette kabobs with rice were grilled sweetness of beef and chicken chunks with the same delicious spice as the chicken wings, absolutely delicious, with an added surprise of a unique onion sauce on top of the rice. My date scooped into the onion sauce right away, and that first delightful bite was followed by a swoop back to suck up the rest. Yet, we also took half of that home, too. The food provided a great dinner meal, followed by delicious leftovers for a second meal. The total price was $65 for two entrees with sides, appetizer and drinks (and leftovers).Calabash African Restaurant is not only elegant and ""A Delicious Dream"" but it's a great, reasonably priced place to bring a date, impress a client, have special celebration and more! Don't let this new restaurant fade into the sunset before you get a chance to try it. Delicious elegance like this in an ethnic setting with grilled meats and a new spicy taste only comes around once in a while!",0.9997
13-Jul-22,"Let me start off by saying I was soooo excited to try this place. I called in an order at 4:30 they told me 20 mins for pick up for when I got there 45 mins later it still wasn't ready. I was being real patient because I really wanted to try them but my boyfriend was getting fed up. by the time 6pm came my food was still not done I didn't end up getting my stuff until 630 and they were not busy at all. They got my order wrong after the long wait I ended up paying over $100 and I kid you not everything taste disgusting and had a horrible smell and I'm from the Bay Area I've had some good Nigerian/African food. Needless to say I won't be returning my family couldn't even finish their food and I had to cook dinner on top of spending so much money I am highly disappointed. I got egusi soup with fufu, jollof rice with chicken and one with lamb, empanadas, side of jollof rice and burger and chicken tenders. I want to cry how terrible everything was! I've tried to unload a video of the food but it's not letting me I'll keep coming back to try",-0.9165
8-Jul-22,"It my girlfriend and I's first time eating African Food, we actually found it through TikTok and we were really impressed with the food. We had the Egusi and the Peanut Butter stew. If you're a fan of spicy food, definitely try the Egusi, it has a really good kick to it but isn't too overpowering with the spice! The vibe inside of the restaurant was also really nice we were tended to every so often and they were very nice. We're definitely going back here next time!",0.9596
7-Jul-22,"Calabash is by my house and I finally stopped in after it has been all over the internet.West African food is 100% brand new to me so I didn't know what to expect.I did spend a bit more than I wanted to but idk the process of making this type of cuisine or the cost of it so it is what it is. I've been seeing people eat egusi soup or stew with fufu on the internet for two years and have never been able to find it locally.Calabash is a beautiful space hidden inside an unassuming plaza on Rainbow just south of Charleston. I placed an order on the phone and went in to pay and wait, I was offered assistance by every staff member, and was in awe of how cute the place is. They have a beautiful bar space and plenty of seats. It literally felt like being transformed into a brand new culture.  Staff is wearing cute matching uniforms and there is music videos of African artists on the tv. It is a whole vibe.I took my food home and set up. I tried the egg rolls with and without sauce and I appreciated the flavor more without the sauce. I like the seasoning and spice.I have to say I love fufu and I could eat it all day. I'm Lao and Lao people eat sticky rice in a similar fashion to how fufu is eaten. We eat with our hands and it's had with everything from soups and stews to steaks and salad. I loved the process of eating both the fufu and egusi with my hands. Egusi is pretty spicy on the heat level. For me I'd say it's a medium spice. It is so hard to explain what it tastes like. It is a stew made from egusi seeds. I'm not sure what else is in it but I did the option with different meats. I will say it had some bitter notes that some might not be used to.I loved this introduction for me to West African food. I can't wait to dine in and try other dishes.",0.991
4-Jul-22,"We just moved into the neighborhood and stumbled on this local gem. This is a small locally owned, woman owned, black owned business with root from the continent of Africa (Senegambian to be specific). We've eaten here twice now and they have not disappointed. Our first experience was take out and the food was gone before we could post a review with pictures. Our second time eating here was a few days ago and we dined in. The service was friendly, well paced, helpful, and attentive. They were willing to answer all question we had with sincerity and excitement. Everything we tried thus far has been bursting with flavor and filled with nutrients. We may have over ordered but it was totally worth it because we had enough left over for dinner. Sampler of the Cassava Leaf Stew ""Palasas"", Okra Stew ""Soup Kanja"", and Egusi Soup. This is not on the menu but we ran into the owner and we're so indecisive she offered us a spoon full of each to help us decide and decide we did. They were all sooooo good. If you are hesitant about trying this place don't be it's totally worth it. Come with an open mind and excited taste buds.",0.9484
2-Jul-22,The food is everything!!! I found them on TikTok. The food is so fresh! It made my belly happy. I had more energy leaving then when I came. I live in south Henderson and it's worth the trip!!!,0.9032
27-Jun-22,"If you don't read anything beyond this point, all you need to know is 5 stars is not enough for how insanely delicious the food is here.  ------Walking in, the place is immaculately clean, spacious, and tastefully decorated.  My friends and I were seated immediately and checked on regularly.  Never did our waters empty, or did we lack for ANYTHING.  Now onto the food:1.  Jollof rice with lamb: GET THIS GET THIS GET THIS.  The rice was extremely flavorful, perfect texture and the lamb.  THE LAMB.  Astoundingly tender and the perfect accompaniment to the jollof.  2.  Okra stew with fufu: This was...dare I say it?  Perfect.  The stew had the perfect consistency, depth of flavor and smokiness.  Okra was perfectly cooked, and the fufu alongside?  Literally just PERFECT. 3.  Suya with chicken: So I tried to eat this like normal chicken but um, the meat literally WOULD NOT stick to the bone??????? Again, great spice here.  Incredibly flavorful throughout the meat, nice charred exterior.  4. Fried plantains: I mean, best I've ever had.  That's it. So like, did I just find some of the best food in Las Vegas?  Yes.  Was I hesitant to write this review because of such a gem this place is that I'm worried it will get too busy for me to get a table?  Absolutely.  Is it so good though that it doesn't matter because this restaurant deserves ALL the high praises?  Absolutely.  Ambiance? Check. Service? Check. Portion sizes? Check. FOOD? Publisher's Clearing House sized CHECK. EAT HERE.",0.9955
26-Jun-22,"I've been seeing Egusi soup and Fufu all over social media. And I am a very foodie person, I love experiencing new cultures. I finally got up to try this dish, and what can I say I was not disappointed at all. I will definitely be back to try other dishes from this. The staff is lovely and friendly, you immediately feel welcomed",0.9591
26-Jun-22,We ordered the vegetable fataya pies and plantains to start. Both were delicious. For our entrees we got okra stew and egusi with a side of fufu. The fufu was perfect with the spicy soups. I highly recommend this restaurant!,0.8881
22-Jun-22,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!! The atmosphere was ever welcoming along with the staff. Had a perfect first experience. I had the oxtail stew and it was DELICIOUS!!! 100% would recommend going and trying it out. I will definitely be back again.,0.9749

14-Jun-22,We love the ambiance and friendliness of the staff. Don't miss the Casava Leaf Stew with fufu super delicious!!Nice assortment of desserts and beer selections.,0.9206
12-Jun-22,The food was good. If thats what you're looking for then that's okay. The service was EXTREMELY slow. Waited 45 minutes for our food and when we were done waited almost another 30 for the check. This was on a slow night. Food portion was also very small for the amount they charge.,0.5859
10-Jun-22,"The food was phenomenal Nene was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations and explanations of what was food contained and how it tasted, will definitely be back.",0.7783
7-Jun-22,"Having tried African cuisine once before, I was dying to find another spot closer to home. Ordered food from Calabash and it was great. Egusi and fufu were delicious! Jollof was flavorful, and the other stew we had just the right spicy kick! Price was up there considering the takeaway portions, but the flavor makes it all worth it! Try for yourself! Doesn't dissappoint!",0.8135
4-Jun-22,"The service and food was impeccable. Highly recommend. I enjoyed the ginger pineapple tea as a beverage, plaintains, and egusu soup with fufu.",0.7485

3-Jun-22,"Africa is a beautiful culture that's inherently rich in wisdom and has taught us many valuable life lessons. As the saying goes, ""However far a stream flows, it never forgets its origin,"" this is an African proverb that resonates to this day. One that is most prominent and still rings true is ""The axe forgets but the tree remembers."" Calabash African Kitchen is a wonderful restaurant located on Rainbow and Oakey. You'll find the hidden gem right behind Wienerschnitzel. Upon entering, there's a lovely mural portraying a graceful woman holding a large bowl and on the wall inscribes the restaurant's name highlighting ""A True Taste of SeneGambia."" Interior is spacious and clean with ample table seatings, booths, and nice bar. Music by Mbosso ""Yalah"" is uplifting and cheerful, it's like dancing to the rhythm of African beats.The menu is quite diverse, they offer empanadas, fried plantains, jollof rice, grilled meats and seafood, various stews, vegetarian dishes, and kids menu. Beverages include homemade African juices & teas, wine, beer and sodas. I had Baobab Juice ""Bouye"" ($6) and it's refreshing! It's an ancient African juice made from the fruit of the iconic Baobab ""Tree of Life"" and they blend it with coconut milk, so good! The Fataya Pies ""Empanadas"" (2 for $6) are delicious! It's a soft crisp pastry filled with cooked potatoes and mixed veggies. These empanadas are light and taste great with hot chili sauce, yum! For my main dish, I tried Ndembe ""Bean Stew"" ($18) which is a delicious and hearty black-eyed pea stew cooked with onions, bell peppers, and garlic. The bean stew is seasoned well with amazing spice and is super flavorful! It's served with plump and sweet fried plantains that's cooked to perfection.As for dessert, they have cheesecake, pudding and chocolate cake. I tried Chakri ($9) which is a West African delight made of sweet cream, millets and couscous. Somehow the grainy texture of millets and couscous didn't suit me. It was nice they offered to make a new one with just sweet cream, coconut flakes and golden raisins, and that made me smile! Such a great place with friendly service and outstanding hospitality, it's totally worth it!",0.9991
3-Jun-22,"This was our first time having African cuisine and it was delicious! We didn't know/haven't tried many of the dishes but the staff and owner took the time to answer any questions we had. The owner was so incredibly sweet and took the time to get to know us, share her story and give some insight into the food that represents her heart, soul and home. The components of the dishes we got I will say are common in most cultures (rice, fish, veggies) but what really stood out and tied everything together were the sauces and spices - it was the heartiest meal we've had in awhile. Everything has a spicy kick but serves as a complement to every dish. The outside of the restaurant may not be as inviting as what we're used to but the interior, friendly staff and authentic dishes have us coming back for more. We'll be back very soon!",0.9253
2-Jun-22,"Wow we are very disappointed in our order today. The serving size was in a container 1/2 the size that we are used to. Fufu serving size was very small as well. We will not be bringing our business here anymore. We are loyal customers since the day new ownership took over and our other experiences were very good. Appropriate serving sizes with good taste for the average price. When you pay $30 for Eugsi the serving size should be enough to feed two people or have leftovers, not in this case. I have referred a lot of friends who have never tried African cuisine before, I cannot do that anymore......",0.932
1-Jun-22,"My first time eating at Calabash, and we were met with amazing, friendly service and delicious food. A great atmosphere to enjoy African cuisine and music. A must try if you are looking for authentic African cuisine - 100% recommended!!",0.9656

Fresh ingredients of the highest quality - you can taste the difference. Authentic, flavorful, perfectly executed food! Looking forward to going back! My girlfriend and I sat at the bar and loved our experience. The decor and vibe were stellar as well. The color scheme, furniture, lighting, and music created a warm, comfortable, and amazing environment. Thank you!  Best of luck and God bless! Nick and Nelly!",0.9953
21-May-22,"This was my very first time trying African food and everything was AMAZING! We got the Egusi soup, Casava leaf stew, and okra stew with fufu. It was all extremely tasty and the fufu complimented it well. I've been wanting to try fufu and Egusi soup for awhile now and I'm glad I finally did. Definitely come here and give it a try.",0.9374
19-May-22,"I have never had Senegalese food before. Thanks to Yelp, I found one! Las Vegas has so many different ethnic restaurants. It's fabulous!  Oulay, the owner, has the presence of a long time restaurant owner. Nope, she is new at this and loves sharing her food. Service was efficient. We had the empanadas and black eyed pea fritters to start. Really yummy. I had the okra stew and hubby had lamb chops. The lamb chops were amazing!  They were topped with spicy onions. The okra stew was delicious. I ordered goat. There were big chunks of goat, not many bones. (People who order goat know what I mean). We ended with the yogurt dessert. Delicious, I would love it for breakfast. We will be back. But it might be awhile.",0.9597
18-May-22,"I am so happy there is such a nice African restaurant here in Las Vegas. After watching some Nollywood movies, I decided to have lunch at this spot to have some Eguisi Soup. This place is clean, bright and nicely decorated. The beautiful owner greeted me and made me feel welcomed. I highly, highly recommend this place. I want to return to try the Jollof rice. Portions are very generous and I had plenty of leftovers for my lunch tomorrow.",0.9829

14-May-22,"Been wanting to try Egusi Soup & Fufu for a couple years and finally did at Calabash African Kitchen and I was not disappointed at all. We also got the Jollof Rice, plantains, and Shawarma which were just as good. Clean and sophisticated ambiance in the restaurant, great service, and amazing food. Will definitely be coming back!",0.9707
10-May-22,"OMG.!!! The food is VERY flavorful. I got jollof rice with chicken. The chicken was fall off the bone moist & very tasty. The spices touched different taste buds that probably hasn't been touched before. I got beef empanadas. They were good. They came with some sorta spicy sauce that was good too. The plaza isnt that great to look at but once you go inside, the decor is so pretty. The place is clean, almost like fine dining but it is casual. There is a bar. I love the atmosphere. They play African music and the music video is on the TV. The customer service is amazing. Employees are super friendly. I can't wait to go back & try other dishes. I always eat Asian, Mexican, American or pizza. I'm usually disappointed with African restaurants. This one did not disappoint at all. It does live up to perfect 5 star rating. I was amazed!!! My phone's camera isn't that great. The food looks better in person.",0.9946
8-May-22,"First time eating African food.  We were in a rush so we got it to go and didn't get the full experience.  The food here is good and I really like the ambiance.  It's very modern look with culture decor.  We got casava leaf stew, peanut butter stew, fried plantains, and fataya.  We got it with fufu.  Fufu was pretty soft and dipped it in the stew.  We wanted to try other things but we will next time around.  Service was fast and friendly.  We got to meet the owner.  She was very nice and informative about the food since it was our first time.  We will be back!",0.9284
7-May-22,NEW RESTAURANT ALERT  Delicious food. Menu is vegan and vegetarian friendly. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the ingredients in the food.

27-Apr-22,"Friendly customer service. I ordered for pick up and the wait was not long at all. Nice atmosphere. I'd dine in next time. Food is fresh and delicious. Everything was packed neatly and with great presentation. Portions are enough for two! I ordered the Attieke - Grilled Red Snapper. The fish was tender yet crispy and packed with flavor and spice. Yum! The couscous, onion confit, and salsa complemented it well. I also got the jollaf rice with chicken.. Not strong in flavor but I enjoyed it -served as a pallet cleanser for me. If I could give more than 5 stars I would.",0.9323
19-Apr-22,I wish i could leave 10 stars tbh. Service... AMAZING... ambiance... AMAZING.... Food...AHHHMAZING!!! She just opened 2 months ago and we happened to find her by chance on our way to the record store. We were treated with so much attentiveness. She walked us through the menu and made tons of recommendations. I was so happy with what we ordered. The beef was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The egusi and pounded yam were impeccable. We also had the jollof rice... this rice is by far the best jollof I've ever had in my entire life.If you have a chance you really should stop by and eat. The owner is the sweetest. Thank you so much for such a wonderful experience.,0.9757

12-Apr-22,"Everything was fantastic, ambience, decor, service, and the food! They have vegetarian options and gluten-free grain to accompany the stews.",0.5983
11-Apr-22,I ordered different dishes. I wanted to try the peanut stew but that is their most popular dish and the wait for it was a bit long for me. The hibiscus's juice was nice. They played music from all over Africa on YouTube (you can see the tv by the bar). They have a nice bar area and enough seating to be comfortable.  An totally see this spot being a lounge at night. The food was ok...the traditional dish with jollof and fish was a bit burned and wasn't as enjoyable as I would have liked. I got beef tips as well(well done) which was pretty good. I got a beef patty and it was pretty dry on the inside. I don't think I finished it. I didn't like the tomato sauce that came with it either. The person I went with got okra stew I think and they thought it was great! I also got the yoghurt dessert and that was GREAT!,0.9934
7-Apr-22,Excellent food and service. 100% authentic. Made from scratch. The hot chili sauce with the empanadas is delicious. Rich flavors. You must try it!,0.906
4-Apr-22,"Most of the time when people are looking to try out restaurants they usually ask for suggestions from friends or family members. In this particular case my cousin and I decided to look on our own. We found an African restaurant called Calabash African Kitchen.. The atmosphere, the taste of food, customer service, dining experience, and price of food were all amazing. In addition to this, my cousin and I felt at home..  Concisely, this particular Gambia-Senegalese restaurant delivered the best dining experience with flavors that blessed us abundantly I highly recommend going there and to experience it yourself. I am hopeful that everyone will enjoy all they offer and not just the food.",0.9758
2-Apr-22,"I was in Vegas last weekend and ate at Calabash my entire trip, I pretty much tried everything on their extensive menu. There is something for everyone, they also offer a variety of vegetarian options. The owner is very attentive to all of her customers, you can tell this is a labor of love for her. The restaurant is beautiful and clean, bathrooms smelled wonderful. The cassava leaf and egusi soup are delicious, but my favorite was the grilled red snapper, which was mouth watering. The seafood and kitchen Patties were amazing. The portions at this restaurant could feed two people, and they are well priced. I will also recommend their house made drinks. I can't wait for my next visit.",0.9794

30-Mar-22,I have been craving west African food for five years. I'm glad that this place was built. It smells sweet like an apple candle when you walk in. The bathroom is really clean. The owner explained the whole menu and shared how it's similar to my husband's food but with a slight variation. I am grateful for her explaining to me even though I am familiar with west African food. The interior design is beautiful. The fataya pies are yummy and the sauce that accompanies it is a bit spicy but I really enjoy it. The Cheb Bu Jen was excellent too. Come see and try for yourself.,0.9863

The music is great, the staff are very friendly, and I can't wait to come back. Not pictured was the delicious pineapple ginger juice. I ate almost all the food before I remembered to take a picture. As a water snob, I feel like I can never drink the complimentary water at most places, but this water is sooo good, like artisan or something lol. Such a good experience!",0.9777

9-Mar-22,"After working out with a friend of mine, we decided to check this place out. We were greeted by a nice lady. I didn't get her name, but I wonder if she was the owner too.I've been wanting to try Fufu for like 2 years now. I keep seeing cool videos on TikTok, and I have always loved to experience other cultures through their food.It's in a corner of a plaza, and the outside doesn't look inviting, but inside looked great. I liked how the color orange was part of their color scheme, how there was a bar in the middle with a TV that played catchy African music videos, how the seats around the bar were drums. Initially, I thought they were just for display, because they were drums! I even had a bet with my friend, but it turns out that you can sit on them hahaI'm going to be honest with the coconut water that we ordered. It was a total let-down honestly.. I thought it was legit coconut water in an actual coconut, but it was Vita Coco lol the cartoned coconut water that you can get at Sam's Club for $14 for a 12 pack.. definitely not worth paying $4 each.. HOWEVER, our kind server gave us complimentary drinks to try. One was hibiscus-flavored and the other was pineapple-ginger-flavored. The presentation was nice, but I will have to say it was VERY concentrated. The pineapple-ginger one reminded me of the ginger shot that you can get from Jamba Juice. My friend liked it, but it was too much for me. As for my hibiscus drink, I actually dumped it inside of my cup of water to dilute it, and it tasted sooo much better :) For food, we ordered the Cassava Leaf Stew (""Palasas"") with a side of Fufu and fried plantains. I really need to emphasize the fried plantains.. THEY WERE SO GOOOOOOD!!! AHHHH!!! Okay, I'm filipino, ok?? And when I had them, they tasted just like the fried plantains in the Philippines. The sugar on it caramelized perfectly to me. It honestly tasted like home. It makes me miss my lola's cooking :,) Our main dish was the Cassava Leaf Stew with (of course) Fufu! The stew was a huge portion honestly. It can feed 2 hungry people. It can honestly feed 3. You just have to order more Fufu. Trying Fufu was a cool experience for me. Like I said, I've been curious for 2 years now, and I finally got to try it! FYI, the Fufu is really hot when you first get it, so be careful. Idk if you're supposed to eat it while it's suuuper hot, but we waited for it to cool down because I couldn't hold it in my hands from how hot it was in the beginning. I really wish the woman who helped us kinda taught us more about it or how to eat with it. I know, I know, I know that it's self-explanatory. Like you literally just use your hands, but I'm new. LOL I didn't grow up with this. Either way, she was very very nice to us.Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly afterwards :) Also, this is random, but I really appreciate how the bathroom smelled. It smelled clean, so I felt good, knowing that they clean well here too. xDI'm so happy I finally tried Fufu, and I liked it too. I had a great first experience, and if you're curious about trying Fufu for the first time, you should come here too.",0.9996
9-Mar-22,Literally the best African/Nigerian restaurant I've had this far.... The inside is beautiful and clean and the food is amazing !!!! The jollof and egusi and empanadas and the red snapper was off the hook! And to top it all off the hostess was SO nice and patient and pretty . My first time trying egusi and it was giving very much pleasantly surprised..... A+ plus plus plus. It was so bomb i didn't even get a chance to take pictures my mom and I devoured everything Lolol,0.9764
8-Mar-22,"This place is a gem! The food was flavorful and generously portioned. Each plate was more than enough to be full and happy. The habanero hot sauce they make in house is to die for! Nothing felt too heavy or too processed, it all felt like someone's auntie was in the kitchen putting in work. The owners were very hospitable and attentive, the entire place is very clean and beautifully decorated. Can't wait to visit again and sit in the new bar stools!
