7-Dec-22,"Eggs benedict is easily my favorite breakfast food, so I was really excited to try Popping Yolk Cafe. I ordered Classic Eggs Benedict and it was overall an unpleasant dish. The hollandaise tasted like vinegar. I don't know if it was sour or if they meant for it to taste like that. The potatoes were good, but not the star. The salad was bland with random bits of corn. My friend ordered the BBQ pulled pork benedict. We only ate one eggs benny each and then trashed the rest. I was surprised that we were both disappointed.The flatware was so cheap and dull that it was hard to cut through the english muffin. How Sway?! The dish is $18, please buy decent flatware. The service was adequate. The ambiance is meh.",0.8649
7-Dec-22,"I've come here before, around opening time and enjoyed my experience. Came today (still here as I'm writing this review) with my son at 2pm to have a late lunch with my son. Food was amazing. Huge portions and fast service. Food was so good but we couldn't finish because at 2:15pm, the staff started cleaning the kitchen. We became nauseous from the overwhelming smell of cleaning products. It caused us sto stop eating. Then, the staff started mopping around us. That's just too much, especially when we are eating. We spent nearly $50 just to feel sick. They close at 3pm, but this is not acceptable. They did not take into consideration that we are having a dining experience at all and how this affects their customers. It was tone deaf on their part.",-0.4806

Avocado Benedict (bottom) | $17 | 5/5 Review:- They were quite busy and had lots of people as there was a line that led outside the door and seating was mostly full- Solid place for brunch, specifically eggs benedict- They offer lots of different variations of eggs benedict which is nice- Generous portions as the meal was pretty filling with the eggs benedict, salad, and potatoes!- Not much barbeque flavor in the BBQ pulled pork benedict- There is indoor seating with pretty decorations and a nice ambienceParking:Free parking in the nearby parking garages",0.945
4-Dec-22,"First time.  Place was very clean.  Ordering food before sitting down is a great plan.  Once at table the server looks for your number given at register and brings the drinks.  We ordered coffee.  Water was brought at no request in beautifully clear glasses.  We ordered the French Toast Banana with caramel, it was so crunchy delicious with just right amount of sweetness.  Plus the Classic Breakfast Bacon, Maple flavored sausage, eggs over easy, 1/2 slice of lightly toasted white bread and potatoes.  The potato's were fried to very crispy crunch was so good.  Also the Spam kimchi omelette was very unique and the flavor made my buds alive and happy.  The staff was very Friendly and helpful.  We will definitely be back!",0.9903
3-Dec-22,So delicious! Big portions and a great atmosphere. We ordered the Norwegian Eggs Benedict with a Horchata Latte and the  Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich. Will be back soon!,0.865
1-Dec-22,"I'm kind of stunned that I spent $30 on lunch for a latte and eggs Benedict after tax and tip. It was a bit way too spicy for me. it was very dusted with paprika? I think. Service was nice, but my silverware and glasses weren't the cleanest. I would consider this a substantially filling, but not the healthiest version an eggs Benedict could be.",0.1415
28-Nov-22,"If I could afford/ didn't care about my waistline, would sooo eat this every day. Every dish we saw come out of the kitchen looked like a work of art. The all-stars of their daily brunches are clearly their wide variety of Benedicts and omelettes, served with a light and oh so tasty salad (yay ruffage!)  and the best brunch potatoes have ever had! My order was the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict, annnnd wow. Perfectly sweet and spicy, this bene had the perfect satisfying crunch and juicy chicken. The hollandaise sauce wasn't too heavy but so very flavorful. The poached egg (pictured) was beautiful and done right! He ordered the California omelette, which had a sample of, 'twas delicious. Can't beat the Benedicts though! The service was quick and efficient. Each customer places their order at the front entrance, takes a seat, and served from there. Our glasses were not once less than half full. Tried the Taiwan Beer - mango flavor- tasted like a canned agua Fresca. Would personally skip this next time, the drink was super sweet with less than 3% alcohol.  Go for the mimosas and water! This spot is undoubtedly THE place in Alhambra to do brunch. You gotta go!",0.9921
24-Nov-22,"Brunch is a huge staple in California, and this place meets the bill nicely. If you are looking for healthy, they got it. Luxuriously casual, the family style seating isnt my goto, but it isnt the worst either. There are separated tablime settings both inside and outside as well, for those who need or desire a more private setting. The french toast selection is both something dreams are made of and your dieticians worst nightmare - an experience to be had for sure. Whilst I do not partake, the mimosas look great as well.",0.988
19-Nov-22,"To date, this is still my favorite place for French toast since it's never overwhelmingly sweet and has the perfect outside crisp. I've tried their other benedicts but this was my first time trying the soft shell crab one. The portion of the crab was generous and definitely not overshadowed by the egg itself! I also tried their Popping Yolk Burger which had an angus beef patty, egg, and grilled mushrooms! It was a packed and heavy item for breakfast but delicious nonetheless. If you're looking for a refreshing drink. Try the mango green tea! It's fruity and light plus it's unlimited refills.",0.9566
16-Nov-22,"The food was good but you pay for the ambiance. Service wasn't the most impressive but again, people come here to catch a vibe and an ig worthy food pic. Cute and tasty but doubt I'd come back because I'm more of a diner style vibe.",0.2667
12-Nov-22,"Came here with the mindset I wanted all American breakfast. What we got was so much more than that. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for it but it was way too extra for us. I ordered crepes for the kids thinking they were simple and the norm. The crepes had too much going on. Not a very kid friendly Menu for ones 3 and under. The people working there was the super nice and worth the mishap on craving for breakfast. If you are looking for huge portions and Etta extra, then try it. But it wasn't my palette norm.",0.891
12-Nov-22,"Really cool, really decadent breakfast spot with great coffee drinks.  We had the waffles and calamari.  It may be worth coming early if you want to avoid the crowds.",0.7713
11-Nov-22,"Everything was perfect, which explains the wait time. It is worth the wait. Fresh quality food, good service. Not used to this check in. It's my first time at this business. You check in thru the iPad in the front by the main door. It will give you a time. When your wait time is over you come up order and they will tell you where to sit. I got the Nashville Hit Chicken Benedict. It was better than I expected. I thought the chicken was going to come dry and huge, but it came to a perfect size and completely fresh, the chicken was juicy the potatoes were fried to perfection. I love my potatoes crispy. Their salad was delicious and fresh. They constantly come asking you if you would like more water. There's straws available at your table without request. Definitely a great first time experience for me I don't understand why this place has four stars. I eat out a lot and this place was immaculate. Thank you for providing good quality. I rather pay more for good quality then to eat something I don't like and get bad service because they are not charging enough.",0.9915
11-Nov-22,"Do not order the American breakfast plate. The worst breakfast plate I've ever had.  The potatoes were so fried they tasted like crispy oil.  The bacon was thin and oily.  The maple sausage and sunny side up eggs were fine. A mixed green salad with corn and italian dressing-on a breakfast plate? The meal came with an unusually small piece of dry toast..missing butter, jam.  Maybe another slice, too.Also, the restaurant has a horrible, cheap cleaning solution smell...and even more potent in the bathroom.I regret not asking for another plate.  I was with a friend, and we were deep in a conversation; I didn't want to disrupt our flow of conversation, so I didn't complain about the horrible meal...I won't be returning",-0.2809
10-Nov-22,"Seriously delicious! Went with the family for brunch and there food was absolutely fantastic. Plus, what seems like endless coffee refills, although, I do think their coffee could be a tad stronger. Regardless, delicious place. Definitely looking forward to coming back.",0.9564
9-Nov-22,The food is good! They have potato grits included with your Sandwich but I also ordered fries in the side. Don't do it as the meal itself is more than enough. I could hardly finish the food! I had the salmon Benedict before and it was so good. The Nashville chicken is also juicy and good but not as spicy as I would wished. But that's just my preference. 10/10,0.8816
9-Nov-22,"Ordered a lot of food, only couple of things that I liked, would definitely watch out for a couple of menu items. The NashvilleBenedict was nice as well as the Belgium. Id stay from the the straw berry crepe, the French toast",0.8555
9-Nov-22,Very cute atmosphere! Came for an early morning breakfast during the week. Not busy that early during the week. Good food and fast service! I will be back if I'm ever in the area again.,0.7768
6-Nov-22,Highly recommend their French toasts! Do not get their teriyaki chicken omelette it is a weird combination,0.3367
5-Nov-22,"For the price I would expect better service. Because you pay before sitting down, ordering after being seated is inconvenient. Came with a group of 3 and paid over $90 for the sides to be just potatoes and salad for all the breakfast items. I thought it was pretty pricey.",0.5106
3-Nov-22,"Walked here for lunch to enjoy breakfast food There is plenty of seating, water was brought to us right away, and there are lots of cute decorations making it a pleasant environment. We ordered sweet potato fries (pretty good but not as flavorful as other places) and the french toast (really good and i like the crunchy bits)!!I would come back, lots more to try! My friend treated me so I can't comment on price.",0.966

3-Nov-22,Hit this spot this morning. Food was pretty tasty and service was friendly. Will be back to try some other items. I do recommend trying the French Toast.,0.836
29-Oct-22,"Popping Yolk is definitely a hip spot for breakfast. It's also VERY much on the pricier side. I came with my family and we all got some version of the BENEDICTS & also the HOUSE FRENCH TOAST. ENJOY!PS: The wait can be long, get there early to put your name down.",0.4574
28-Oct-22,"First time experiencing this place and I will not be coming back The food was strange and too expensive to not deliver. If you're going to charge, deliver on taste!I also didn't enjoy having to walk in and order straightaway vs sit at the table and experience service.",-0.5747
27-Oct-22,This place was delicious! The portions are huge and the food was so good! You order then sit down and they then bring you your good. They were very good about filling up our waters and the women taking our order was so nice and helpful. Would highly recommend.,0.9804

10-Oct-22,Definitely a place for Eggs Benedict lovers! There is a good variety of Eggs Benedict and omelettes on the menu to choose from. Thought it was a little strange that you have to join the waitlist to order and pay at the counter. Food overall was good. We got the Norwegian Benedict and Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict (chose mild spice level). Both came with a generous amount of their country fried potatoes (unseasoned) and salad. The eggs were perfectly poached. Also tried the iced horchata latte which was surprisingly good. It wasn't overly sweet. The women's bathroom was a little dirty with water all over the floor. Had to walk carefully to not slip. There are free parking structures in the area so finding parking shouldn't be an issue.,0.9744
10-Oct-22,My eggs Benedict was good and had plenty of meat- both Canadian bacon and bacon. We ordered the deep fried French toast and didn't enjoy that as much. A classic French toast seems to be more of the way to go for us personally. The orders come with plenty of breakfast potatoes and nicely sized portions.,0.4891
9-Oct-22,This place is a nice little hidden gem in Alhambra decided to give it a try this morning absolutely loved it! Indoor and out door covered dining you place your order when yo I walk in and take a number they bring everything to you. Portions are large potatoes are amazing everything is well seasoned we ordered hazelnut iced coffee an iced green tea ham and cheese omelet and the avocado and ham croissant sandwich as well as the banana toffee deep fried French toast everything was really good!! They bring a wine bottle of water to your table for self serve as well which was really convenient! My only recommendation would be serve a side of syrup with the French toast it's really thick and crunchy so the little bit they put on top isn't enough but 10/10 would go back 0 complaints and 5 stars!,0.8321

2-Oct-22,"We've been here a few times and honestly, the food is amazing. We've tried several of their eggs Benedicts and also their sweater breakfast items (waffles and French toast) and the food is always on point.  Portions and generous and prices are reasonable.  They're also pretty fast when it comes to service/bringing out the food.There are, however, a couple of cons that both relate to the outdoor seating area...1.  Aside from the cute wallpaper, it looks/feels a bit janky.  If you're sitting against or facing the wallpaper it's okay, but any of the other seats have a pretty unsightly view.  You'll probably be staring at a small storage area (extra tables, baby chairs, etc) and/or the trashcan.2. The outside feels a bit dirty. If/when something spills (very normal in a restaurant), it spells on cement floors that really can't be cleaned up.  It puddles, chills, and starts smelling.  (Ie, there was a random puddle of liquid with 1 loan strawberry chilling near us that sent wafts of odors woth random gusts of winds.3. General smells.  The large waste bins are directly behind/next to the outside dining area.  Depending on the wind, you'll periodically smell garbage 4. No one comes to check on you if your outside. So if you need anything (condiments, dropped a fork, more water,etc) you won't be bale to flag someone down. 5.  There's no AC inside, or it's not strong enough.  Feels muggy.",-0.5351

27-Sep-22,"I got there and signed up on a tablet by the entrance. I waited and after 30 minutes of waiting, I notice people that got there before me were getting a table, I thought maybe because their party was of 4 or less, but then I notice they sat a party of four in a table that was for 8 people. So it made me wonder why my party of 6 got skipped. I decided to ask the cashier. As I approached the counter, the cashier asked if I got called, so I said no, but  people before me are being seated. Then she asked for my number and said she had texted me, I had been standing right by the entrance and never did anyone called my name or texted me. She then said she had texted me and since I didn't answer ‚Äç. I was confused and annoyed by them not having clear communication, I waited for 1 hour for a table, when I could have waited only for 20 to 30 minutes ‚Äç. Food was good. Service ‚Äç",0.2279

13-Sep-22,"4 starsI don't usually eat breakfast, but when I do, it's either dim sum or someplace with eggs benedict. I've always wanted to try this place, but it's always been too crowded for lil ol' introverted me. So I decided to order take-out on a weekday to avoid the weekend crowd. I chose the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict w/ medium spice. What other Yelpers have reported about this dish is true. It's not spicy and it's really (REALLY) greasy. The grease soaks into the English muffin, so be aware of that. The crunchiness of the batter is really good and, if you're a batter person, you'll enjoy this one. It's a good sized piece of chicken too, so don't worry about it being all batter. Because of how big and crunchy the piece of chicken is, cutting it up to eat is messy. The coleslaw was really good! The breakfast potatoes were decent and I didn't find anything wrong with the salad.If you get take-out like me, skip their plastic utensils and use your metal ones at home. Best break out that steak knife! On a side note, while I was cutting the chicken, I accidentally flicked a piece of fried chicken onto the floor and my dog grabbed it and ran off to his happy place. So...I can safely say the fried chicken is dog-approved...All-in-all, I like the restaurant space - very neat, clean, and well-cared for. As soon as I walked in, the lady at the cash register knew I was picking up. Presentation of the food was really nice! Sauces were all packed in separate containers. Free parking is available in parking garage or street parking.",0.9961
10-Sep-22,"Amazing place for brunch! The atmosphere inside was really cozy and they also offered seating outside in the back. The menu is very versatile so there is definitely something for everyone! :)My sister got the Classic Benedict while I got the House French Toast (Half). We were able to finish everything and my French toast was so delicious. It was crispy and my favorite part is the fresh fruit! One thing to keep in mind is that the restaurant itself lacks windows and natural sunlight. So it is fairly dark which made it difficult to take photos. To make up for it, they have lights above almost every table.Overall, would definitely recommend stopping by for some breakfast food or sandwiches if you're in the area!",0.9714
8-Sep-22,"Wow- my family and I ate here this last weekend and I'm kicking myself for not checking it out sooner. We always lament not having enough good breakfast places nearby. We always go to Mike and Anne's in south pas, Gus's, or Mimis in Monrovia- We recently tried Lost Parrot in south pas, hoping that it would be good and close by but were frankly disappointed- this place however, WOW! I had the brioche breakfast sandwich and the crepe, my hubby had the croissant sandwich and my daughter had the French toast. Everything was AMAZING! Even the juice was fresh squeezed and delicious- my only gripe was that it was pricier than I would've liked but honestly, you get what you pay for- this breakfast was worth it- so delicious! The potatoes were crispy and yummy. We will definitely be back and are so happy to have found such a great breakfast/brunch spot closer to home.",0.9955

4-Sep-22,Man this place gets packed and I can understand why. Not many brunch places in Alhambra. I had their California omelette. It was ok.

I would probably get one of their Benedict's next time instead.,0.868

3-Sep-22,"Apparently the electronic wait list sign up at the door does nothing. Put our names down and waited patiently only to watch people who came in after us and didn't use the wait list get served and seated first. Very frustrating. Eventually we wised up and pushed our way to the counter since that seems to be how you get service here. I pointed out the issue with the electronic wait list to staff, but they didn't care, and gave off an overall surly vibe. I'm still confused about how ordering food is supposed to work here, and I think the staff is too. As for the food itself, its just your typical American breakfast items, but oversized, oversweetened, and overpriced. There are plenty of other brunch options in the area, and I'd rather eat someplace where they don't punish politeness.Oh, and I know this is a super odd complaint, but the knives they give you are extremely flimsy, like child safety knives, and totally unsuited for cutting. Maybe they've had too many instances of frustrated diners stabbing servers?",-0.215
2-Sep-22,"Highly recommend for brunch with friends but the wait can be quite long, so add yourself to the waitlist beforehand! Food portions are SO big so it's very worth the price you're paying and it's also delicious. We each got our own dish but regretted it afterwards, because the portions were just so big. While I'm a huge fan of omelette and mine was rich with various ingredients, I especially enjoyed their salad that came on the side. At first glance, I think the plate can look very overwhelming but there was a good combination of food that made it very enjoyable and yummy!",0.9907

7-Aug-22,"Had the classic eggs benedict and toffee banana french toast (half portion: 3 pieces). I'm an eggs benedict enthusiast and I'd like to say that their eggs benedict did not disappoint! It came with a small portion of salad and fried diced potatoes, the potatoes weren't soggy, it was crispy but not burnt so it was great. The toffee banana french toast was deep fried so it was sinfully delicious. I wanted it to be a bit sweeter so I did ask for extra syrup. I also had the mango green tea which was pretty good and it was refillable, definitely a plus!",0.9826
7-Aug-22,"First time and we were exited to try the place. The wait was okay for a Sunday at 2pm. You put your name down and they call you when a table frees up.  You order ahead of sitting and I have to say I found pricing to be quite expensive.  Most breakfast plates in the upper teen prices ($16-19). I thought that was quite a bit so I was expecting very good flavors and plenty of it. That was not the case.  It was good tasting and decent amount but not for $100 + tip for a family of 5 FOR BREAKFAST.  Maybe dinner would be a decent pricing.  We had 5 meals and they came at such staggered times we could not enjoy it together.  I got my meal first and the last meal came over 20 minutes later. While waiting I asked the guy to please check on the last meal and he went to the back and didn't come offer us any type of explanation or when to expect it to come. It finally came.  Overall the food was pretty good, service was okay, but one last gripe....for the love of god, turn on your air conditioner!!.  It was a hot day and must have been 85-90 degrees inside.  That's not comfortable indoor temp to eat in.  Maybe trying to save on power costs but for that alone I would not return.",0.9749

4-Aug-22,"i really love this place. It's my fav breakfast spot!! i like that you can pre-order at the front register, so if you have a big party, everyone pays in advance at the front for food and drinks, so when you're done, you can just bounce and not worry about splitting the bill and all that jazz.  The Food?! AMAZING!  I got the Nashville crispy chicken Benedict and it was Bomb, the chicken was perfectly crunchy and the pouched egg was cooked perfect!! not too yolky or undercooked, but perfect. i'm super picky with potatoes and they had the best potatoes, those super crunchy ones cut up in small dime size squares. sooo good. i had their sangria, and it was excellent. i got the pitcher for my group and it was so delightful, light and not too sweet. definitely order the white sangria. i've had their omelette as well, and it's wonderful.  the ambiance is super cute and has a modern/ earthy feel with plants  and stuff as decor. the staff is very nice and service is good.",0.9974

29-Jul-22,"I've been here before, and I've met some work from other popping yolk locations. However, while me and bf came and had lunch and ordered we did not receive any utilities for our food. When we asked for a knife to cut our food, we got told the silverware was not washed. I understand places are understaffed, but why was another group of people given all silverware. Then everyone around us got served water and even gave them refills, and just ignored us when they passed by with their pitcher. It just felt that it was a little racially motivated. Since we were the only brown couple. Fortunately the food was great, if you're a brown or black poc and want to eat here just be aware some of the staff is rude. This is not he first time staff has been this way. The only good experience we had was when it had just opened.Also there's no need for an apology post because I haven't seen any change with staff.",0.6739
28-Jul-22,First time trying it and ordered the hot chicken sandwich. You're able to choose the level of spiciness and I got the second to hottest one. It wasn't as spicy as I'd hope BUT service was great.,0.8225
28-Jul-22,Our second time here and we enjoyed our meal. This place is a  nice and cozy place for brunch. The food is delicious and the servings is huge.  The staff is nice too. Will definitely come back,0.9485
26-Jul-22,"Was so excited to try this place based off of the reviews and they did not disappoint! Earl Grey Latte was so flavorful, the House French Toast had a unique crunchy texture that was great, the Classic Benedict is a must, and the Crunchy Honey Comb Crepe was on the sweeter side but had a variety of textures that made you want to keep eating. Only critique I had was that the Egg Salad Sandwich is much creamier than I expected. If you like a more thick and creamy Egg Salad as opposed to fluffy, you'll like it but the texture was a surprise to me. For reference, it was around $75 for our party of 4. Definitely give this place a visit!",0.9692

21-Jul-22,"Very cute brunch place conveniently located on Main St where everything is. I didn't even know when this place opened and never got to try it till today. Gets pretty busy, almost at full capacity on a Thursday for lunch.Pro:- easy parking, plenty of public/street parking around and conveniently located to lots of boba/dessert shops within walking distance- fast service of food and good service overall- beautiful presentation of the food- huge portions- their earl grey latte was bombbbbb (substituted whole milk with almond milk), perfect blend and not too sweet- the French toast was also a 10/10Cons:- the fried calamari was a little disappointing, lacking flavor and breading, 5/10- the Cowboy burger was not very flavorful 5/10- the Nashville hot chicken Benedict sounded and looked good, but not spicy and flavorful enough (got medium and couldnt taste any spiciness to it, the cocktail sauce from the calamari had more spiciness to it and idek if it's supposed to be spicy), also overly oily (yes, I know it's fried chicken...) 4/10- added too much milk to the iced latte (didn't ask to substitute the whole milk with other options) couldn't taste the coffee at all 1/10- quite pricyWould definitely return to try the other menu items. Great vibe, great decor, great service!",0.9874
21-Jul-22,the food portions here are absolutely ENORMOUS which is great as their food quality is also TOP TIER. they give a bunch of country fried potatoes and their salad is tossed in a vinaigrette. all the benedicts are great and the staff here is super nice. seating can be quite tough on weekends for large parties. try try try!!,0.9634
21-Jul-22,This spot is amazing!! There are tons of options on the menu to choose from and service was quick even on a Sunday morning at 10am. I got the house French toast which was to die for!! It's perfectly crunchy and sweet. I got the half portion which was enough for me. I'm glad they offer that size because the full size is a lot! My boyfriend got the bacon and cheese sandwich and it came with potatoes and a salad. The sandwich was also amazing! The bread was so fluffy. We also got a horchata latte and match latte. The matcha latte is great and it has intense matcha flavors which I love and I feel like at some other places it's subtle but not here! Parking: there is a free parking garage on first street north of popping yolk. It's a short walk away or you can find free street parking.,0.9752
19-Jul-22,Great atmosphere and great food. Everything was delicious. The French toast are 10/10. If I had to change one thing would be the set up. I think the host needs to be right at the entrance. It was my first time there and I didn't know you had to order before sitting since everyone was kind of just standing in the way. Overall great experience though.,0.9517
19-Jul-22,"Ate here on Saturday after a long hike a friend recommended it and friends and i were wow so much food for such a good price and amazing presentation.Customer Service is awesome they're on top making sure you have everything you need. We didn't wait much for food and even if we did. The food was so good Can't wait to come back and try other plates...Place looks super clean and front desk lady is very sweet and kind, took her time to explain and help...Recommended it... Perfect place for Breakfast or Brunch",0.9927
18-Jul-22,"I've eaten at this place a few times, and my experience there has been outstanding! The food here is savory with some sweet options and is perfect for my taste. The potatoes were crispy but soft on the inside. The spring mix salad was fresh and paired well with their yuzu dressing. As for the entree, I decided to try out the Teriyaki Chicken Omelet, and it hit the spot. The omelet was cooked perfectly, and the chicken was packed with flavor. A plate can be shared with two people if you are a light eater and is plenty for someone with a big appetite. I would highly recommend bringing friends and family to try out the food for yourself!",0.9837
14-Jul-22,"Fantastic brunch place in the Alhambra area. Usually packed so expect a bit of a wait. You order up front before getting seated so use that time to decide. I typically get one of their benedicts and haven't been disappointed. Great selection of food, dessert, coffee, and other drinks. Only minor complaint is that this place is a little pricey but they really do make up for it in quality.",0.0849
14-Jul-22,"The portion is really big. I only ate a 1/4 of the plate, didn't feel good the whole day,  I did throw out 1/2 day, feeling dizziness too. I don't know if it is the smoke salmon wasn't fresh or the oil they use.  That was a bad experience",-0.7482
12-Jul-22,"After hearing so many people recommend Popping Yolk Cafe, I decided to try it and went for breakfast this morning. MEHTheir specialties are Eggs Benedict!!!!!!  There definitely was no popping yolk in my breakfast!  My egg was under done.  Instead of a nice yellow yolk popping out, I had an unappetizing grey liquid coming out.   BIG disappointment.  I would rate it no more than 2 stars, since that's their specialty and it was a big FAIL!!!  I have a video, but Yelp is not letting me load.",-0.5272
9-Jul-22,I had been wanting to try this place for a while. Went today with my son. You order at the cashier first and then sit with your number. The portions are pretty large. I had an omelette that came with salad and potatoes. The omelette was meh. Didn't have much flavor. The salad was dry. It literally didn't have any dressing. The best part was probably the potatoes. My son ordered Orange juice. They charge $6.95 for a glass of OJ. No one stops by your table and asks if you need anything. The place is overpriced for bland food. Go to Urth Cafe instead.,0.6808
8-Jul-22,"4 starts for the foodGood amount is good and make you full.However, there is small print note in the menu for 3% service charge for kitchen staff. I think that should inform customers before they pay.I don't mind to pay 3% but it feels like it's mandatory......",0.654
7-Jul-22,"Came here twice for brunch and they do tend to get pretty busy. We had to wait about an hour for a table. Aside from the wait, the staff were efficient and friendly. You place your order, pay, then get seated. Food and drinks came quickly. Their portion sizes are large and most of their dishes comes with potatoes and a salad. It was enough to fill us up! Can't really go wrong with any of their options on the menu. This place has made its way into my regular brunch spots.",0.8968
7-Jul-22,"Food is great and portions are right for the price. It's all about the egg and chicken here.  It's cafeteria style, so you order at a counter and sit to receive your food.  Their hollandaise is good to excellent. It could use a touch more acid.  The potatoes were overdone so it tasted like fries.  That was the only downside. I'll be back to taste the other items .  Worth a stop , but it's quite a busy place so get ready to wait . Bon appetit.",0.8673
3-Jul-22,Not understanding why people like this place. There is no outdoor seating. You order your food and drinks at the front and then seat yourself. If you want more of anything you have to go back to front and wait in line. This is ridiculous. I don't like cafeteria style restaurants. Do these people not know it's rude to only serve one person at the table and make the rest wait. I mean seriously rude.,0.594
2-Jul-22,"I had been wanting to try this place out for a while and let me tell you, It did not disappoint! Food was really tasty and the service was great! The cashier ""Cris"" was extremely helpful and attentive to us especially my son since he was indecisive on what to order,she even came after we got our food to check if he liked what she helped him order. He loved it! I ordered the California omelette and he ordered the toffee banana liege waffle. Delicious! Will definitely be going back.",0.971
2-Jul-22,"My little sister was really excited to try Popping Yolk Cafe after hearing me talk about how delicious their food was and we finally had time to come today! Unfortunately, while I received my food, she had to wait over 30 minutes for her food and there was no communication or even an explanation once it arrived. If we did not check on our order, I think my sister would've had to wait even longer. Normally, a little wait time is expected but the restaurant was clearly not busy as there were several empty tables. In fact, two tables who arrived LATER than us, received their food first. Although the food was good, we will not be coming back due to the lack of communication and service.",0.6639
1-Jul-22,"Service is set up to order and then is self seated. Great service and rather quick. The hot chicken Benedict was delicious, ordered mild and had no spice so I would definitely go up on the heat if you want some kind of spice. The tables also have a couple of condiments to choose from to your liking.",0.9114
29-Jun-22,"I'm such a Popping Yolk fan after only one visit. Alhambra knows how to do brunch right and i'm staking that statement solely on my single experience here. Ordering is done in a line at the front of the restaurant and then you sit down at any open table and wait for your food. I was discombobulated at first but I found I actually prefer this to the traditional wait for someone to take your order and then wait for the food. It makes it feel like the food arrives faster. There's such a variety to order from, but they have such special menu items that you can't get really anywhere else all at this one place.Kimchi and spam omelette was amazing. They were not stingy at all with the fillings which is such a positive quality about food. Every single bite had kimchi and spam and egg, so it never lost touch with being an omelette. The eggs benedict plate was giant (I could definitely have gotten away with sharing, I was only able to finish one of the two poached eggs on the english muffin). Both come with a happy helping of salad; half the plate was salad, which gave it a very mediterranean vibe and earns 5 stars from me for promoting heart healthy diets! This place has so much range because on the other hand of our leafy main dish was the french toast, and can I just say wow. I usually am not a french toast fan but here they deep fry it like it's a hash brown. The bread itself is sweet that it doesn't need more than the handful of blueberries, strawberries, and the light drizzle of syrup to accentuate it's taste. It's like we blinked and then it was gone. The ""half"" order comes with 3, so it was perfect for sharing. I got enough to satiate my sweet tooth without feeling deep food guilt after. They are also strong drink-wise. I had some decision anxiety so I asked for a recommendation and the server didn't even hesitate to tell me to get the horchata latte. I'm so glad I did. It's not usually my go-to drink anywhere else, but it will be here. The matcha latte my friend got was also phenomenal. Both were so creamy and perfectly balanced with the different flavors but not too sweet, which was key. The ice was perfect too. If you know ice, you know when you see the crushed ice you're in for a treat. Thanks for a great Saturday brunch!",0.999
29-Jun-22,Went here for brunch with my family while visiting. We went at the prime brunch time so the place was packed but everyone was really friendly and the food came out quick and hot! The food was a little blah but nothing a little bit of hot sauce couldn't fix!,0.7321
28-Jun-22,"I have tried Popping Yolk's Hacienda location, so I am no stranger to this delicious brunch spot! I did takeout and settled with the toffee banana french toast (the full), popping yolk burger, and California omelet. The total came out to $54. The Popping Yolk burger stole the show! The beef patty bursted with SO MUCH flavor when I took a bite. It was big, juicy, and cooked at the perfect temperature. The egg yolk oozed through the burger, which was an excellent complement to the burger. The sturdy toasted bun completed the entire thing. I recommend getting this dish! The California omelet was terrific as well! The omelet came with spinach, tomatoes, avocado, spinach, and mushrooms and was slathered with a good amount of pesto sauce. I thought it was so cool that the avocado slices were tucked inside the omelet! Each bite was super fluffy yet still firm enough to blanket all the toppings inside. Everything tasted so good, and it was all well seasoned. I loved the saut√©ed mushrooms and spinach the most. The toffee banana french toast was spectacular! The toffee and regular syrups were SO GOOD. The syrups tasted so rich with that caramel butterscotch flavor. I loved how there were enough banana slices with each bite of toast. It complimented the fried toast well! The entire thing was surprisingly not overly sweet, so that was great!  The country fried potatoes that came with the dishes were just okay. They were very dry. This is a spectacular brunch spot that I highly recommend you come to. The interior is super cute, so I look forward to dining in person in the near future!",0.9969

26-Jun-22,"Food was quite good. My wife and I REALLY like the variety in the menu options, and so much of it is unique. 1 really BIG problem... the location needs to have an AC or something. Even a few fans would be helpful. It was OVER 90¬∞ today, so just having the doors open does NOT allow for good airflow (especially with the amount of people in the building). When a person feels as if they are overheating, it impedes them from enjoying the meal. I'm not sure who decided to use Edison bulbs for the lighting, but it should be made clear to them that Edison bulbs give off quite a bit of heat, as well as the spotlights attached to tracks overhead. Add the fact that the kitchen is open to the dining area, it makes for an extremely heated atmosphere. Stop being cheap, and add an AC or some fans, before you people start having medical emergencies in your restaurant.",0.8623
26-Jun-22,"After having breakfast at this restaurant for the fourth or fifth time, I can honestly say that the salmon quality has definitely regressed... I find it less fresh and it has a fishy taste. Overall, the food was average, but for the price it was expected to be much better.  Seven out of ten!!",0.8311
25-Jun-22,I got the popping yolk burger and the lychee white sangria. The burger was cooked very well just between medium and medium rare. The burger also came with a very generous portion of potatoes and salad on the side. The lychee white sangria was also pretty good but honestly a bit expensive for what it is. The pitcher used to be $25 for the pitcher which would've been a good deal but now that it's increased to $35 it's a bit high. It's definitely worth giving a try though if you don't mind the cost.,0.9765

23-Jun-22,"I don't think I will be back. I was quite annoyed with the service and food wasn't worth the wait. I've had better hollandaise sauce and mom and pop shops 2/3 the price. The wait was about 45 minutes for 2 on Juneteenth which was fine. I like that they text you so you can leave the area and you don't have to just wait outside for them to call you. Once it was time for us to come in, I was surprised to find out you seat yourself. You order at the cashier and then you get a number and seat yourself. I thought they would have a table ready for you. We ordered the Norwegian Benedict and the Nashville chicken Benedict. The chicken benedict took like 25 minutes which was fine. The other benedict took another 20 minutes after we got the first one... like what. Me and my boyfriend didn't enjoy the meal as we literally had to eat with each other yet at separate times since the food came out at such differing times. Food was subpar. Will not be back.",0.8422

17-Jun-22,Popping Yolk was a welcoming place for breakfast. Servings are large and can be shared. The staff is very friendly and our coffee cups were refilled often. We arrived soon after opening and there were plenty of seats but by 9 the place was full. It is a bit on the pricey side but a place I would recommend and go back to.,0.799
14-Jun-22,I really enjoyed the food here. I always enjoy a good eggs benedict so I had a Norwegian benedict and the eggs were poached perfectly. I also enjoyed the hollandaise sauce on it. It was really a lot of food and most of my friends couldn't finish their plates. The french toast was nice and crispy on the outside while being soft on the inside. It was different from other french toast I have had which were a lot softer all around. You also get a LOT on the plate and it can be too much sugar all at once. The prices seem kinda high but I think it's decent for the amount of food you get.,0.9067
13-Jun-22,"Came here yesterday to see what the hype was all about. I tried calling before heading out to ask how long the wait time was, but no one picked up. When I got to the restaurant, I had to put my name on the waitlist. The wait time stated 50-60 minutes, but we got seated about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad. FYI: They don't take reservations. It's first come first serve. The girl putting in our order was really nice and patient with me since I was asking a lot of questions about the menu. FYI: You will have to order and pay first. After you pay, they'll hand you a number which you take to your table and wait for your food & drinks. We ordered a mimosa & lychee white sangria. I honestly didn't really like any of their drinks. The sangria was really light. Could barely taste the wine in it. The mimosa wasn't even cold, more like lukewarm which was kind of gross. We also ordered half portion of the French toast & the classic breakfast (we replaced the salad with toast). A few minutes into eating the classic breakfast, we noticed the girl didn't put in the order of French toast. I had to give my card again during our meal and started getting impatient since the whole experience started going downhill. The only thing that was really good were the scrambled eggs and French toast. The scrambled eggs were cooked to perfection and had some crispy bacon bits on it which we loved. Also, the French toast was really unique. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Half portion for $8.50 was pretty worth it. However, didn't like their syrup that we asked for on the side. Tasted really weird.Service was not that great (except for the girl at the cashier even though she forgot to put in our order of French toast). I didn't see one server smiling or seem that enthusiastic about serving the customers. Honestly, I don't know if I'll ever come back..",0.9753
13-Jun-22,Stopped by early on a Saturday morning. We were given a 39 minute wait time but then they ended up being ready sooner. The food was amazing and the service was great too! We ordered the Strawberry Cheesecake Crepe which was filled with some kind of cereal and cream and strawberries. It was amazing and not too sweet. We also ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedictt. It was spicy and a pretty big portion. There was also a Starbucks right next door where we were able to grab a coffee while we waited. Would come again :),0.9803

11-Jun-22,"A cafe named with the two words ""popping yolk"" with a menu centered around eggs and their different shapes & sizes might seem like any other brunch spot in LA however the quality and portion sizes are what differentiates itself from the mainstream. We ordered the Smoked Salmon Omelette, half Toffee Banana French Toast, and Horchata Latte. There was a generous amount of smoked salmon in the omelette which went well with the spinach and mushroom. The french toast was a good kind of sweet and had small dollops of whipped cream on the side if you want an even extra sweet taste.The seating is spacious, the menu is ideal for those with dietary needs, and my experience is just a reminder of what an eggcellent spot this is for brunch!",0.9628
10-Jun-22,"My first impression from what I have heard from people was that it was a overrated brunch place that did have some good food, but overall was not worth the price. However, after coming here to try it for the first time, I would like to put that aside and call that absolute BS. This place was amazing and delicious and would love to come back again. At this time, I got to try their Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict as well as their Crunchy Honey Comb CrepeTheir Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict was a great 9/10. To start off with the star of the dish, their Nashville Hot Chicken was one of the best I have ever. The chicken was extremely tender and flavorful and worked so well with the egg that it just all melted in my mouth. I couldn't help but just keep taking bite after bite of the entire thing. My only gripe of it was that I wish it could be bigger, but that doesn't take away from me still being extremely satisfied with the dish. The dish also came with a nice garden spring salad which helped cut through all the fat and grease as well as nicely chopped potatoes that were perfectly crispy. Overall, a very nice treat to have.The Crunchy Honey Comb Crepe on the other hand tho, this was a 9.5/10. I am a very big sweets person, and when I first saw it, I thought I was still going to be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of honeycomb that was placed all over the crepe. However, when taking my first bite into it, you could tell they really plan their dish out in its entirety. The sweetness of the honeycomb was nicely mellowed out by the strawberry and cream but still packed a nice, sweet punch that I wanted. Each bite was a bite of heaven and I had never had a crepe this satisfying before.Overall, I look forward to coming here and eating their food again, very yummy!",0.9988
8-Jun-22,"This little cafe is just a few doors down from the Starbucks on Main Street. You cannot miss it, with a bright yellow awning. For me, I went on a Monday. There was no parking on the street so I took a chance and parked in the parking lot behind the Mel's diner. I was lucky enough to not get towed but there is street parking if you can find it. The staff are very friendly. They will definitely greet you once you arrive. It is best to have re-search the menu before you get to the caf√©. You are to place your order at the front desk/counter  and then have a seat, or wait to be seated depending on how busy the restaurant.I ordered the toffee banana French toast and they were absolutely phenomenal. The way they were fried and coated, perfection. Eating just the French toast itself without any syrup or anything added, they reminded me of the fresh golden goodness that you would get and expect from the Carl's Jr. French toast sticks. I loved those growing up as a child. Even still, I often go to different fast food restaurants late night and when I have that craving for something sweet, that is what I am looking for. How could you go wrong with French toast? It is such a classic. This take on that very classic is something that you must try at least once in your life. I am not huge on banana especially after having become allergic to them after my having had a child but I can tell you right now, it was worth the (luckily) one single hive  that I got. My girlfriend got the barbecue Benedict. I don't know how her dish tasted but she definitely licked everything off that plate. Our food had absolutely been devoured. I kept trying to think about our experience there in the meal that we shared. We offered each other a bike but both politely declined. I do now wish that I had tried her Benedict however I was so in love with my French toast. I would order that again even. The presentation of the food was beautiful. Everything look like it was positioned and played it just so. When I thought about the conversation that we had to get a meal, there wasn't one. How could that be? Oh I remember. We were too busy enjoying our food that we didn't really talk or say much except and oh wow that's really good. So definitely I think that this is a place to try out. I don't know how long it has been on the main drag through Alhambra on Main Street but I hope it didn't go anywhere anytime soon. I did notice that they are only open until three in the afternoon. If I were you, come on a day off when you're not in a rush and eat here leisurely and enjoy the ambience. One thing I did notice I did make a comment about was how I felt that one side of the restaurant had been nicely revamped with sort of trendy wallpaper and the other side where the bar was not. I dunno what look they were going for with only the one side having wall paper but ... it works.",0.9985

28-May-22,"The food looked extremely appetizing, the menu is loaded with a lot of options and everything seems like it would be good.The food came and is seriously under seasoned like not even salt or pepper... they serve a rather large randomly assorted salad with every meal. The food tastes like the frozen section of super market. The mozzarella sticks were really good. The bbq poached egg was bland and the egg and bacon sandwich came out dripping with bacon grease. I'd choose egg slut or poached in Downey instead. Also for the prices a brunch at lazy dog seems way more reasonable. Not a foodie but love a good egg based breakfast and this ain't it.",0.465

25-May-22,"I wish I had good things things to say about this place. But I do not. And extra star is for the food; it tasted good when it came.We ordered at the door as expected. There were no issues, no discussion, no conflict or controversy. Nothing that would lead me to believe some human factor was in play in our following breakfast experience. In fact, we left a good tip, both in cash for the servers and on the bill for the restaurant as we usually do to support local businesses. They were not particularly busy. We found a table right away and were brought our tea within minutes. And then the waiting started. 25 minutes later, we were still watching other peoples' food who ordered after us, arriving while we looked on. Finally, my partner's omelet came. It was cold and the potatoes were cold. It looked like it has been waiting to be served for a while. But no food for me!As my partner waited for my food to arrive, his getting even colder, I called for our waiter. Her explanation made zero sense of course as it always does not in these situations. She said they were processing orders as they came in. I asked why everyone else's food was ready and not ours. Some people already finished, in fact. She had not explanation. Then she tried to tell me we must have had separate tickets. Nope, we ordered and paid on the same check. She said you food is coming soon...but we came here to eat together, not to watch each other eat. Basically, they screwed up processing our order. My food arrived 40 minutes  after ordering and 10 minutes later than my breakfast companion's. No restitution or apology was offered. I truly wanted my tip back, not because I expected special treatment, tipping is my choice, but because I expected  good customer service simply because I am a customer. I will not be coming back and will not recommend this place to anyone.",0.7987
24-May-22,"Came here for the first time after lots of debate. Our go-to has been Yangs but we wanted to give this spot a try specially since there was no wait. You order first, get a number and get seated. I got their Norwegian Eggs Benedict and it was really good. Eggs were runny, potatoes were crispy and the salmon was nice. Overall, solid brunch spot.",0.8196
22-May-22,"A nice brunch place where myself and two of my co-workers visited on a Sunday morning. Place yourself on the waitlist when you get there and be ready to order when you are called in as your order is taken before you sit down. Nice place, good service and the food was delicious.",0.9287
22-May-22,"A good spot for brunch in Alhambra. You sign in at the entrance and they tell you to look over the menu at that time and let you know how long is the wait. We were told 25-35 minutes but we waited only 15 minutes. When you go in, you go to the cashier at which time you give your order and pay for your meal. I tried to order decaf coffee but they don't have it. The only way to get decaf coffee is to order the latte. You are also ask to give your tips accordingly BEFORE you are served your meal. The foods has good flavors. I ordered fried fish eggs Benedict and my husband or Norwegian smoked salmon eggs Benedict . My husband enjoyed his meal. However the salad dressing  saturated my muffin so it became soggy. My fried fish was fried too crispy and overdone. If you need service, you have to try to get the servers attention because they are rushing so quickly. They didn't come around to see if everything was ok or if you need anything else. No personal interaction with the patrons. I don't know if I want to come back.",0.8525
22-May-22,"This place is a place to dine in for the breakfast in 626 area. The orange juice is very fresh and refreshing. Their fries are the best, homemade style. I would recommend the French toast as your dessert. The half size is already a lot for 2 people! Parkings are plenty on the streets.",0.862
15-May-22,"The cashier (I forgot her name) was very rude to me. When I would ask questions about their menu, she'd answer rudely and say stuff in another language to a coworker nearby. It was my first time here so I just wanted to know more about it. You don't have to know another language in order to catch the hint that they are talking about you. I don't know what I did in order for them to behave like this, or maybe they're just like that. I wouldn't come here to eat or even work here. I wouldn't say it was a color thing, but I also was the only brown person in the restaurant at that time and I didn't see them do this to somebody else. Also, the Egg Benedict was not that good. I don't know why it is hyped. Save your money elsewhere.",0.114
15-May-22,"The popping yolk breakfast was 10/10. The eggs I ordered was scrambled and it came out perfectly. The potatoes were nice and crunchy, almost snack like. The bacon was cooked crispy and juicy. My girlfriend ordered the half toast french toast. The toast itself was super crunchy but not super to the point where it hurts your teeth, just enough for the perfect crunch every bite. The syrup complements well with the toast and the berries cut the sweetness along with the powdered sugar. Overall, the french toast was a 10/10. The hazelnut latte was not too sweet, just enough and very delicious. The orange juice was freshly squeezed and had natural sweetener for the sweet portion. We loved the place, definitely will come back again.",0.9853
12-May-22,"3.5 StarI always appreciate it when there is non Asian restaurant opened in 626 area, it just gives us more options to dine in and take out. Popping Yolk Cafe is located in the heart of Main Street, there is always a line whenever I passed by so I never got to try. Until one day during slow work day, my husband and I decided to check this place out since there was no line. I got their American breakfast plate and my hubby got smoked salmon benedict. My breakfast plate was okay. Toast was cold. Sausage was tiny. However I did enjoy their country potatoes. They were crispy and cut at the right size. They also gave great amount of salad! I asked for scramble egg white and it was great.",0.9184
10-May-22,"The ""classic breakfast"" and mango iced green tea I had here were delicious. The staff was also very attentive and helpful when I asked for refills and other items. I will come break for breakfast/brunch for sure.",0.8428
10-May-22,Five stars. They seem to have several stores. I've been to Pasadena's and I didn't expect to see it here. Their toast really blows my mind. It's so good. Vanilla coffee is also great. The most satisfying thing is that they are so considerate. Hopefully they can come up with some dessert,0.9575
8-May-22,"Somebody PLEEEEASE explain to me why my order of a benedict and crepe took over an hour and a half? The whole benefit of running a breakfast restaurant is the ingredients are dirt cheap to the business and their menu items should go out very quickly as the food cooks quickly. You're telling me that this place overcharges and has ridiculous wait times? Hard pass, wont be getting food here again.",-0.3939
5-May-22,"I am a brunch lover and this place just reaffirms it. There tends to be a wait because of how busy it gets, but it's all worth it to me. Everything savory comes with a garden spring salad and a generous amount of country fried potatoes. The potatoes are always crispy, delicious, and perfect. Norwegian Benedict: Eggs were poached perfectly. Salmon was fresh and nicely smoked. Hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery. These were the most ideal eggs benedict I could ask for.Croissant Avocado and Ham Sandwich: Honestly the best croissant sandwich I've ever had. The croissant was toasted to perfection and the eggs were cooked sunny side up. The avocado, ham, cheese, and mayo brought everything together very well. BBQ Pulled Pork Omelette: If you love bbq sauce, then you'll love this. It was abundantly packed with pork, mushrooms, and spinach. The pulled pork was soft and flavorful. Comes with a slice of toast too.",0.9978

24-Apr-22,"Customers need to wait in line to order then get waitlisted for table. We ordered to-go when this was explained to me, and still food took 30 minutes to get. Would have had to wait 30 more minutes to eat cold food at a table.  Ridiculous to learn of a 30 minute waitlist when I look and see half the tables empty. This was my birthday lunch trying this place for first time. Don't come here and ruin your birthday unless you like excessive waits.I sat on a barstool and watched people that arrived when I did getting seated and food. The cashier knew were I was but did not call me when my food was brought to the front. Got home and the food was quite yummy. Perhaps I might investigate calling in order of ordering on internet if possible. Restaurant needs to get their act together.",0.5006
23-Apr-22,"Wow, me and the wifey really enjoy this breakfast spot that we found when we are exploring the area. There Bendict's are amazing, I got the soft crab Bendict and my wifey got the avocado.

Definitely will be coming back some more!",0.9537
22-Apr-22,"I was craving for brunch and decided to try this place out, definitely did not disappoint! You order and pay first thing, in the front, and then you can find seating. It gets busy shortly after opening so if you want to dine in, I suggest coming at open. I came at around 8:30AM and by the time we were done eating there was a line waiting outside already! Horchata Latte - amazing! It wasn't too sweet but a great addition to brunch.Florentine Benedict was so bomb! I think this was one of the best Benedict's I've had. The egg lives up to its name and I was able to pop the yolk beautifully. Theres mushroom and spinach inside, also comes with side of fries and salad! Flavor was there!Nashville Chicken Sandwich had a nice brioche bun with cole slaw. I don't usually like cole slaw but this sandwich was good. The chicken was crispy and not too spicy. You can tell them when you order what level of spiciness you would like. My bf got medium and it didn't taste spicy at all. I highly recommend this place! Their vibrant yellow exterior is very hard to miss :)",0.9904
21-Apr-22,"Food is great but expensive and service is terrible.  Went a little past 8 am on a Saturday and the person taking orders in the front completely ignored us. We had to ask if they were open.  Once your food arrives, they don't check on you at all. Seems they are more worried about getting pick orders out. You will have to flag down the workers to get refill of coffee or even napkins.  Lots of customers were getting up and grabbing sugar from other tables. It was the third time going and thought their service had improved but still the same.  To top it off, it was expensive.  2 coffees with an order of crepes and an order of eggs Benedict, a little over 50 dollars.",-0.4365

18-Apr-22,"One of our favorite breakfast/brunch spots in this neighborhood. If you're planning on dining in, get there early or prepare to wait. We usually go right when they open to avoid the lines. The menu consists of a variety of Benedicts, omelettes, french toast, sandwiches, burgers, waffles and crepes. My husband's go-to is the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict. Think Howlin Rays breakfast style. For me - I don't usually order a sweet breakfast menu item, but I had to try their Berries Farm Liege Waffle and omg...I order it every single time now. My husband and I share those items and it's the perfect combo.more recommendations on my blog www.losangelysse.com",0.8181
17-Apr-22,"Came here on Saturday around noon and there was about an hour wait.  Came back on Sunday, around 10am and there was a line, but it moved fairly quickly.  You order your meal at the front desk and then grab a number to set it down on a table (open seating).  Ordered a Japanese Green Tea Latte, mango green tea, Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict (medium spicy), BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict, and Toffee Banana Liege Waffle.  The Green Tea Latte and mango green tea drinks were good.  I especially liked the Green Tea Latte.  It was very smooth and had a lot of green tea flavor, also loved the design on the latte.  The Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict was good.  I wish the chicken was a little spicier, but there's always Tabasco, The chicken has a good breading and was crunchy, eaten with the cole slaw, egg, and English muffin, it was very good.  The country potatoes were also amazing - it was so crunchy!  I wish I had more space to eat it.  The BBQ pulled pork benedict was a little on the sweet side from the BBQ sauce.  The Toffee Banana Liege Waffle was good, but it was very sweet.  It was a pretty big portion and could not finish it.  The ice cream went well with the waffle since it was sweet (Liege Waffles are usually on the sweet side, so it's not out of the ordinary), but by the time I got to the waffle, there wasn't that much ice cream left.  I didn't taste toffee banana in the waffle itself, so I was a little disappointed.  I guess you just eat it with the sliced banana on the plate.",0.9966
16-Apr-22,"Came here during their soft opening years ago and thought it was just okay so I haven't been since. But I decided to give it another shot since they were still figuring everything out back then and was pleasantly surprised by how great everything was! I use to live in SD and in comparison, SGV doesn't have too many good brunch places, but I'm glad I finally found one! Ambiance: 5/5 The restaurant is so cute and trendy!! Honestly if I were to open a restaurant, I'd also want it to look like Popping Yolk :)Food: 5/5I got their new benedict, the fried chicken one, and it was actually so delicious. The best part for me was the potatoes -- they were so crispy!! Gave me the same satisfaction as eating chips but they were warm and fresh and more potatoey. At first, I thought the prices were a bit steep, but looking at the amount of food on my plate made me understand why. Salad AND enough potatoes for two meals!! Service: 5/5The person taking our order was really friendly! For an order-then-sit-down place, it was surprisingly easy to wave down waiters to get extra water/boxes from the comfort of your own table.",0.9975
16-Apr-22,"Been here twice. First time was pretty good. We got the matcha latte, mango iced tea (refillable), popping yolk burger, and Nashville chicken burger at a spicy level. They were very busy, but very responsive.Second visit was different. We came back because we saw many people order the eggs Benedict, so we wanted to try it as well. They were less busy than the first time (we went on a Friday last time, this time was a Saturday), but staff seemed to be slower somehow (was hard getting their attention). We got the mango iced tea, Nashville chicken eggs Benedict, and the Norwegian eggs Benedict. Similar to last time, our meal came at different times (strange as one of us would be eating half of the meal before the other dish came). The thing we couldn't get over this time was that our poached eggs were overcooked (more so for the Nashville chicken egg - see photo of the egg yolk we popped out). That was really disappointing. The poached eggs for the Norwegian eggs Benedict was a little runny, but more jammy. It was a pretty disappointing visit... Sadly, I'm not sure I would come back again :(Overall, an average of 3 stars since the first time was pretty good.",0.233

15-Apr-22,"So not only does TX have big things, so does this place. This plate was HUGE. I felt so bad because I was forcing myself to eat this and it was way too much food. We should've ordered this and split it, everything was delicious. We got Horchata lattes which was THE BEST. Defineitly recommend.",0.8281
15-Apr-22,"Popping Yolk has easily become one of my favorite spots to have breakfast/brunch. They have such an electric menu; it's sure to have something for everyone in your party. I really enjoy their omelets. The pesto omelet is great as is their kimchi and spam omelet. The omelets also come with a side of diced potatoes and a salad. It's a great combination. They've joined the hot chicken craze (yay) and now have a hot chicken breakfast sandwiches and a hot chicken benedict. The hot chicken sandwich is SO good. I love anything that comes with a fried egg. Popping Yolk sure knows how to make a good fried egg with the perfect running yolk. Their name is attributed to popping their perfectly cooked eggs and revealing that yellow gold. Yum! I also like their sweeter dishes like their French toast. Their French toast is crunchy, which I love, and it comes with a variety of topping options. The berries are really good if you want something fresh and sweet and the bananas and caramel are just sinful. If you haven't had a chance to visit Popping Yolk yet, I would recommend that you try them ASAP.",0.9958

My friends got the Benedict and they loved it.,0.9835

I couldn't care less about the salad that comes along with all of it but everything else is fine. I had the Horchata latte and that was fine as well. Nothing crazy, and tasted mostly milk to me.Biggest downside I noticed was that there was fruit flies near where we sat in the front. Hoping it's not a normal thing but definitely not great.Overall, it's a nice space for food with friends/family. I suggest going early before it gets too packed!",0.9296

You order at the front, then grab a seat. I got the Norwegian Benedict. So good! Loved popping the yolk and mixing it with the potatoes. My friend got the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict, he liked it but said it wasn't that hot. We also got the fried calamari and mozzarella sticks for sides. They were good. Definitely ask to make the calamari spicy, it has a nice lil kick. Entree portions are generous, the sides could be bigger but that's just the fatty in me lol. Will definitely be coming back to try more. Service was good. Friendly staff in masks. We got there a little before 11 and were able to order and get seated quickly but it got pretty full and busy later on. There's street parking and a free structure around the corner on 1st St.",0.9948
28-Mar-22,Super cute brunch place!! You walk in and order at the counter before you seat yourselves with your order number. There's lots of seating and although it was busy we had no trouble finding a table. The Norwegian Benedict was super good -- amazing poached egg and the potatoes were so crispy. The house French toast surprised us because it looked kind of like a hash brown but it really was just deep fried and crispy French toast. I've never had anything like it and it was the best thing ever. If you're looking for a cute brunch spot in the area definitely check it out! It's a tad pricier than most brunch places but I'd say worth the trip.,0.9824

26-Mar-22,"A really great brunch place! Popping Yolk is one of my favorite places in the area. I usually get the nashville chicken benedict, but I have heard great things about lots of their other menu items. The portions are fairly large, the staff is accomadating, and many of the menu items balance traditional breakfast flavors with subtle Asian flavors. I think the owners also started Dot and Dough, so they are definitely great restauranteurs in the local area. Wake up in time for breakfast, because Popping Yolk is eggs-celent!",0.9732
26-Mar-22,"May husband and I have recently decided to try new places since we're fairly new to LA (less than a yr). This place has been on my list to try for a few months and I even follow them on IG. Anyways we got here at about 10am, there was a bit of a line but nothing crazy. So we put our number on the list and it said about a 15 min wait. So we went and walked around for a bit. What we didn't know is that you order your food at the front so there are no waiters coming around taking your order. I wasn't sure how it would work if we wanted to order another drink or something else to eat, I'm guessing you would have to go upfront to do so which is kind of annoying especially if there is a line that's growing out the door. After we got the text that it was our turn to order we went upfront ( I felt like we were skipping people) and placed out order, I had the house French toast with a side of bacon and eggs and my husband had the bacon and eggs am sandwich with a cappuccino. We were told we can only sit inside as there was no outdoor seating available. After finding our seat about 10 mins later our drinks came out with a side of water. And then about 15-20 mins later my food came out first. This part I didn't like because now my husband is sitting there watching me eat or I'm waiting for him and now my food is getting cold. I have to say I never been to a restaurant like this. After about another 10 min wait his food came out. The French toast was not bad I enjoyed it the eggs were kind of under cooked for me but it wasn't bad. He says his food was good which was the sandwich and came with a side salad and potatoes. I tried the potatoes and they weren't seasoned so we added some salt and pepper and that made it much better. Overall we did enjoy the food. Just some lack of communication about ordering and the way the food came out was inconvenient.",0.9174
24-Mar-22,"Popping Yolk is a popping spot that's bustling and has really nice workers.I went on a Saturday morning with friends and I think our wait time was like half an hour? Instead of ordering with a waiter, you order up front at a register, take a number and then get your food taken to wherever you decide to sit. There's a good amount of indoor seating but I recommend having a seat in the back patio. It's bright, inviting and shady so you won't get too hot out there. Plus, it's decorated very cute!I ordered the Norwegian Benedict. My order came with a side of potatoes and salad but I asked to get only salad, which they accommodated. Unfortunately, though, one my benedicts had some eggshells in it. I could understand and excuse a little bit of eggshell if it ends up in my dish, but I got a LOT of crunch and shell in my meal and just couldn't eat it. I let the waiter know and he was really nice and apologetic. Popping Yolk ended up refunding me my money and offering me free French toast. I declined the toast, though The salad, however, was tasty and refreshing! It nicely complemented the benedict that I ate (the one that was sans shell).",0.9806

23-Mar-22,"It is a very pretty cafe. They have their highs and lows. I went with some of my friends and it was our first time. Their food is pretty expensive. They have big portions that make up for it though. I ordered a chicken sandwich, a crepe, and some calamari. The chicken sandwich was absolutely amazing. However, the crepe was not that great and they gave very little calamari and charged a lot for it. It was ok but not worth the money. Other than that chicken sandwich, the food was just aesthetic looking but not very tasty. We also asked if we could sit outside but they said they weren't opening the outside seating. While we went to wash our hands, we went to look at the outside area and saw some people eating outside and plenty of empty tables. So that made us a little upset. It still is a nice cafe, just don't have such high expectations like we did.",0.7694
22-Mar-22,"Rating: 4.5 StarsBackground On Visit: Was finally able to try Popping Yolk after seeing this place shop up on yelp 3 years ago. Shame on me for not visiting soonerLocation: Located next to Sushi Me on Main St.. Parking can be found along Main St. (2hr parking) or in the numerous parking structures nearby.Ambiance/Decor: Your typical brunch ambiance with modern furnishings. I believe they have an outdoor patio in the back. Perhaps next time, I can sit there.Order Of Operations:1) Order/pay in the front and get a number2) Go to a open table and wait for food to come out3) Eat!Service: Service was pretty good. The staffers were nice, friendly, and offered great suggestions.  I noticed that the staffer punched in the wrong item once I sat down.  I flagged her down about the error and she was able to tell the cook just in time to change up my order on the fly. Bravo... Well done!Food Of Choice:1)  Norwegian Benedict: Consisted of poached egg, smoked salmon, spinach, English muffin, Hollandaise sauce. This entree also came with country fried potatoes. The country fried potatoes was my fave, because it reminds me of the potato cubes in the meat lover skillet at Denny's.  Absolutely loved the smoked salmon on the benedict. Don't think I've ever had it on on a benny. It was a game changer for me.2) Popping Yolk Breakfast: Consisted of bacon, sausage, cherry tomato, garden spring, country fried potatoes, toast. It's basically your tradition american breakfast. Absolutely loved how the bacon was crispy and didn't have much fat on the strips. The garden spring salad and cherry tomato neutralized the savory flavor profile of the bacon, sausage, and country fried potatoes.3) 1/2 House French Toast: Consisted of deep-fried toast, mixed berries, maple syrup, condensed milk. I ordered this one with the syrup on the side. It was the best decision I ever made, because I don't really like drenching french toast in syrup. The fruits (blueberries and strawberries) were very fresh. So not healthy, but loved how it was fried. Made a crunch sound every time I bit down on the toast.Drink Of Choice:  1) Mango iced green tea: This drink is pre-made. I really liked this drink, but wasn't able to max out on the refills because I was getting very full really quick.Popping Yolk For Thought: Wouldn't mind coming back for more. Would definitely see if I can replace country fried potatoes with more salad.",0.9837
21-Mar-22,"Seriously, this cafe made me can't stop eating!A yellow vibes cafe that serves amazing all-day breakfast/brunch menus I really love. My favorite dish is Norwegian egg benedict which has smoked salmon inside covered with delicious Hollandaise sauce.If you like sweetness, try half toast (I got banana toffee flavor) that has half- or full- option. Great for dessert or simply a real meal.The decoration of every plate is actually too-beautiful-to-not-mention. If your camera gets the privilege to eat first like mine, then definitely check out this spot for your beloved one-eye child.TIPS: Get mango tea, it is refillable!!",0.9892

Highly recommend the house French toast, pulled pork Benedict, and medium spicy Nashville hot chicken Benedict (not very spicy). We also ordered the smoked salmon omelet and although it was okay, we wouldn't order it again just because there are so many other delicious options. We ordered an iced earl gray latte and an iced horchata latte. I recommend the earl gray; the flavor of the horchata wasn't very strong. The decor is cute and modern. There is limited outdoor seating and a small bar/counter area. It's a crowded space, but they are accommodating upon request. You order your food at the register and are seated after. Would definitely return to try more items.",0.9604

15-Mar-22,"The service was friendly, the food was just ok.I had the Norwegian benedict and the hollandaise sauce didn't have any flavor really.We also ordered the fried squid which should have been left in a little longer in the fryer, the fried batter came out white.Wife had the Fried chicken benedict and the chicken didn't have much flavor either. To be fair she did order it mild but even without the heat, it should still be flavorful.Friend ordered the pulled pork omelette which was ok.Worth a try but wouldn't come back.Do not order up.",0.4118
14-Mar-22,"One of the things I love about eating in downtown Alhambra is the parking. The parking is free and you can always go to any restaurants in the area and if you wanted to get good breakfast stop by here. It is convenient to order and you don't have to wait besides looking for a table. Once you enter you just order from the menu which is digital now because of covid. Then you find a place to sit. The breakfast potatoes are super crispy and there is plenty of food from each order.We got an order of the half French toast which is by far my favorite French toast that I've had. The coffee banana is so delicious you cannot leave without trying one of these.After eating that, I was almost half full but I ordered the nashville hot chicken eggs benedict before I realized that I overdid it when my partner order her smoked salmon eggs Benedict. Both came with a salad and crispy breakfast potatoes that are amazing and mouth watering. You just have to get a drink or you'll be parched. I got a mango green ice tea to quench that thirst. It comes with refills so you'll always have sugar to go with your hot chicken. I will definitely be back to try some more of their other dishes.",0.965
14-Mar-22,"Came by for the first time on a weekday for brunch, and it was pretty full already. Luckily, a table left after we paid, so we had seating. Not knowing how generous the portions were, we ordered the Norwegian Benedict, Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict, and Toffee Banana French Toast. Although I'm not a big fan of bananas, the French toast was probably the best I've had! I also ordered the Earl Grey Latte, and my partner ordered the Mango Iced Green Tea. The latte was pretty delicious. We definitely over-ordered. Whoops! It was enough food for 3 people! We definitely took leftovers home, which is always awesome.",0.9764

13-Mar-22,Came here on a Sunday at 12:00 was met with a very rude check in person. Will not be coming here again. Horrible customer service . wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,-0.8361
12-Mar-22,"I came on a Saturday around 11am and it was already busy. They had an easy waitlist process - you just add your name using their tablet and they will text you with updates when your party can be seated. We waited around 25-30 minutes for a party of 2, so not bad at all! Once your number is called, you order and pay at the front before you choose your table. They have indoor and outdoor seating, but we opted to sit inside. The service was nice and they were fairly quick considering how many people were there. We ordered an Earl Grey Latte and Mango Green Tea. The Earl Grey Latte was so creamy, not too strong in terms of floral flavor and tasted like genuine tea. They have whole milk and almond milk, but we chose whole milk - definitely a great choice to help boost the creaminess. The Mango Green Tea was refreshing. A bit on the sweeter side, but it cut the greasy, heavy feeling of the food. You can also get free refills, so that's a plus! We ordered the Norwegian Benedict and it was a large portion. You get a side of salad and generous portion of country fried potatoes. The Benedict itself was a bit on the salty side. I typically enjoy smoked salmon, but I felt this was a bit saltier than the norm. I felt the hollandaise was pretty good, very light and not too heavy. This combo balanced out and I felt quite satisfied. I've been to their Hacienda location in the past and tried their French Toast, so I would definitely come back to get that next time!",0.9956
10-Mar-22,"First timer, boy am I happy I got around to it! Here by myself, Thursday morning at 10:15, place is 75% full. I can only imagine the weekend crowd, but in a good way! Had their Classic Benedict and it's the best I've ever had. Pretty sure when the Pasadena location opens I'm gonna live there.",0.9676

5-Mar-22,"Popping Yolk. Where have you been all my life?!?  So the story goes, one Saturday morning, I was in Pasadena area and I was looking for a place to have a nice American brunch with eggs and omelets and all that good thing. Came across the listing for Popping Yolk and drove there and was disappointed that the place was empty. (It was not open yet, under construction still). We figured out they have an Alhambra location and drove there.Popping Yolk is a great addition to the SGV/ Alhambra, Monterey Park area because I don't think I've found a trendy American Breafast joint in this area. It's located in the heart of Downtown Alhambra. Not sure if they have a back parking lot but I was able to find street parking. You walk in and order the food at the register with the cashier, they give you a number, you seat yourself and they'll bring out your food to you.First thing First, their portions are huge. They are so generous that each plate will definitely fill you up not like some brunch places that leaves you still hungry after you meal. We got the smoked salmon croissant plate that comes with smoked salmon, sunny side up eggs, and veggies It came with side of salad and country fried potatoes and we added side of avocado.We also got the bbq pulled pork omelet with mushrooms and spinach. It also came with side of salad and country potatoes. I loved the flavors in this and the to my surprise and liking, the pulled pork flavor really compliments the omelet/eggs. I really wanted to try their popular French toast and luckily they have half order of it so it was perfect to pair up with our meal. It was delicious!! Not your average French toast! It was deep fried, with Maple syrup and condensed milk topped with strawberries and blueberries. This is a must get if you are a French toast lover! Gott an iced hazelnut latte with almond milk, its a little sweet which is perfect. Hot earl Grey tea latte with almond milk (not sweet)Our meal was delicious and filled with flavors! The staff continued to check up on us even though the restaurant was  pretty busy. I suggest to come early because they get busy. I definitely will come back again and try their eggs Benedict I'm hearing others are raving about! Brunch is my favorite meal and I think I found my new favorite brunch place. This place is highly recommended. Happy stomach equals happy Jenn, lol!",0.9988
5-Mar-22,"Our 1st time trying out this breakfast/lunch restaurant.  I tried their salmon omelette, it was good.  I would come here again to try other dishes",0.4404
27-Feb-22,I won't be coming here ever again.... I found a hair in my omelet. Thank god I was paying attention because I almost ate it!! And I have braces so the thought of it getting stuck in my braces makes me gag!! Never again will I be coming here.,0.3331

21-Feb-22,Ordered:Earl grey latteAvocado BenedictTeriyaki BenedictPro:-They have a shaded patio area in the back which was cool and cutely decorated-Earl grey latte was fragrant and perfect!-Both Benedicts were gooey and perfectly poachedCon:-No advanced reservations. You check in at the kiosk to join a virtual wait-list. It was a 30 min wait on Sunday morning.-Pricey!! I wanted to substitute potatoes for sweet potato fries and was told that I would not get the 2 sides my order came with AND it would be $2 extra I recommend coming on Sundays and visiting the farmer's market while waiting to be seated!,0.9588
19-Feb-22,"Eggs were popping.  Cooked perfectly.The Norwegian Eggs Benedict was overall okay. Could have used more flavor. Of the eggs benedict I've had in my life, this is pretty middling. Salad dressing was refreshing with some sweet and sour notes. Potatos tasted like french fries and there was a lot of it.Popcorn chicken had heat which was good, but could have been crispier and had more basil. I'll be going to my favorite boba milk tea shop for my future popcorn chicken craving.Wait for Saturday brunchtime wasn't bad at all.  I wasnt a huge fan of sharing tables with other parties during covid, though.Service was good. Person in the front was friendly and professional.  Water pitcher was brought out promptly.",0.9789
17-Feb-22,"We got the early gray latt√©s and Norwegian Benedicts. Absolutely scrumptious!! The earl gray latt√© was smooth and you could actually taste the tea and it was not overly sweetened. The Norwegian Benedict was a dream- popped yolk melting onto the English muffin with the savoriness of the smoked salmon. We also tried their honeycomb french toast which was sweet, golden, and crunchy! The honey comb crisp reminds me of that Australian chocolate bar with crunchy honey comb inside. It was one of the best brunches I've had in a while :)",0.9474
14-Feb-22,"Came for brunch with the BF to celebrate Valentine's Day early. Saw all the great reviews and decided to give this place a try. It was a bit confusing when we got there. There was a line so we got in line. As the line got shorter, we saw a tablet for yelp check-in, so I checked in and then it indicated there was a 10 minute wait. Then we overheard the person in front trying to place an order that the proper process is to check in on the tablet. Then wait for the return text, then get into line to place order. The person in front ended up behind us cause he didn't do the yelp check in. Wished there were instructions on the process/procedure posted so it would be less confusing.When I got the text we got into line and ordered. We ordered a Norwegian benedict, full tray of French toast, green tea latte w/ almond milk and a lychee sangria. My BF decided to add a popcorn chicken thinking it wasn't enough food. LOL After we paid, the cashier gave us a number and we could sit anywhere there is an opening. We opted to sit at the high bar table since it was pretty hot. The quartz top provided some coolness. The drinks came first. The green tea latte was a bit too light in flavor for my liking. My BF enjoyed the sangria. The French toast and popcorn chicken came next. The French toast was very crispy with lots of blueberries and strawberries. I liked it way better than Blue Jam. It wasn't too sweet either with some side of whip cream. We devoured it. The popcorn chicken was yummy too but would have preferred some more basil. I ordered it medium which wasn't much spicy but they offered to give us more chili powder. The Norwegian benedict came last. It was smoked salmon egg benedict with a side of home potatoes and salad. I especially enjoyed the salad, they used some very refreshing yuzu salad dressing with corn and tomatoes. The benedict was good, the egg was very googy just the way I like it. The potatoes were crispy and good. Overall we enjoyed our meal. We actually over ordered cause we had to take home leftovers (shouldn't have ordered that popcorn chicken LOL) cause the portions were huge. I would definitely be back next time if I wanted brunch. Service was great. Although we weren't sure if we had to tip since we ordered ourselves at the cashier and found our own seat and everything but we tipped anyway. This location is in downtown Alhambra so it's free parking in the nearby structures.",0.9935
14-Feb-22,Popping yolk was absolutely delicious!  The crunchy French toast to the bomb! The decor is super cute!My eggs Benedict was delicious!  Lychee sangria was so yummy never had lychee sangria before so refreshing!Can't wait to go back!,0.9733
13-Feb-22,"Cute little brunch spot in the main strip of Alhambra. Seems like poached eggs are their specialty, hence the name popping yolk.Given COVID restrictions, things seemed rather lax here when I came. They opened up a ""patio"" area which I believe used to be the trash area so there can be some... lingering smells. The food was good though, I got the hot chicken benedict, cause spicy fried chicken is my weakness. It was a hefty plate and definitely worth the cost. The country potatos were also good, crispy all around, which made me think they were deep fried rather than pan fried. I have no complaints there cause deep fry anything and i'll try it.Service was a little mixed though. While the staff was nice they seemed to forget we were there, probably cause we were in the back patio area. It was also quite dirty, with food pieces leftover all over the place. The server also forgot the dressing for my friend's salad and seemed confused as to why someone would ask for dressing.Not a bad brunch spot overall, just some details that definitely need to be spruced up.",0.4228
9-Feb-22,Breakfast here was delicious. They serve good portions. Must try their mimosas; fresh squeezed orange juice was the best!!!!!!,0.877
9-Feb-22,"Seriously, this cafe made me can't stop eating!A yellow vibes cafe that serves amazing all-day breakfast/brunch menus I really love. My favorite dish is Norwegian egg benedict which has smoked salmon inside covered with delicious Hollandaise sauce.If you like sweetness, try half toast (I got banana toffee flavor) that has half- or full- option. Great for dessert or simply a real meal.The decoration of every plate is actually too-beautiful-to-not-mention. If your camera gets the privilege to eat first like mine, then definitely check out this spot for your beloved one-eye child.TIPS: Get mango tea, it is refillable!!",0.9892
8-Feb-22,"This was our first time here and hubby and I were very happy. I had the banana toffee french toast and hubby ordered the california omlet. The French toast was very crispy so smaller bites is better because it does get a little tough on the roof of your mouth. The omlet had a drizzle of pesto which was interesting but good. Both were large portions. We shared and couldn't finish. We had also included sweet potatoe fries, orange juice, and iced tea. It was a bit pricey (est $55), but worth it. The seating is different, you're mostly sharing tables with other people. Most tables are big so you're able to have a space between you and strangers. Overall it was good for a Monday morning.",0.9777
6-Feb-22,I am not trying to be a snobby but I have gluten intolerance that makes me get rashes. The food omelette at this place is okay but aside from the garden salad they don't have gluten free sides that are not fried. I didn't get the sweet potato fries because the person at the front couldn't tell me what oil they used to fry them and if they are prepared or share a surface with gluten containing ingredients. The attendant at the front could have asked the kitchen but she just said they didn't have any gluten free options.,-0.6884

1-Feb-22,"Came here with my friends during the summer to celebrate graduation and it was such a good meal to start off our day. I ordered the Norwegian Benedict and everything just went so well together especially the little potatoes. The salad itself was also very refreshing.

24-Jan-22,"The menu offers a great variety of brunch dishes from savory to sweet such as Omelette, Sandwich, Eggs Benedict, Burgers, French Toast, Crepe, and Waffle. I also love that the food is well presented, and its portion is huge. Their complimentary salad & crispy potatoes (for most entrees) are so so delicious. I love everything I ordered but the Hot Chicken Sandwich is a must-try item! Check out Popping Yolk Cafe for a cute brunch date",0.9598
23-Jan-22,"We ordered the California omelet and the Pulled pork Benedict. So, they first brought one order and the next one came 10 minutes after and then it was the wrong order and then it took another 15 minutes to bring the right order. My girlfriend didn't touch the omelette. It wasn't good. She just had the fries. The coffee was not fresh and tasted terrible. I would've ask for refund but the service was so bad that I didn't wanna wait more on it.",-0.9104

Good amount of sweet and savory options. Street parking is available and there are public lots in the area too.,0.9393
20-Jan-22,The perfect brunch spread . Everything was so good. We've been here many times and it never disappoints! Coincidentally we both got dishes with smoked salmon this time and it was delicious. The dishes comes with their crispy potatoes and side salad. The potatoes are the best. The salad comes with a citrus vinaigrette that we love. We'd totally buy the dressing if they sold it . The house french toast is super crunchy and isn't that sweet. Definitely a different take on your average french toast. Btw the mango green tea is refillable . The staff was super accommodating even after a bit of miscommunication .  We will be back!,0.9806
19-Jan-22,Parking is hard to find so try the parking garages across the street.Eggs Benedict is good and love the hash brown and side salad.The house French toast is hit or miss. The first time was great! Super crunchy and tasty! The second time it was just soggy and every bite is oily. So consistency of quality can be improved.,0.957
16-Jan-22,Stopped by here for breakfast one early morning and had a delicious meal to start off my day.  I got the Norwegian Benedict that came with a good amount of smoked salmon.  The dish came with good portions and I had to force myself to finish the last half of the Benedict.  The house brewed coffee was delicious--I ended up having 3 cups!  The food left me so full and satisfied that I skipped lunch.  Will definitely be back to try the Nashville chicken sandwich.  I heard it's really good.,0.9482
15-Jan-22,My friends and I got the Kimchi Spam Omelette and half portion of Toffee Banana French Toast. Both were solid and just the right amount kf salty and sweet. The portions were big and good - loved the potatoes especially and ended up taking home leftovers. They also had a nice spacious patio in the back if you prefer outdoor seating.,0.93
15-Jan-22,Super cute place. They sell mimosas and all typical brunch drinks and food. A lot of variety which is nice. The portions are big and was very filling. I'm definitely going back again. You have to order your food first at the cashier and then you find a place to sit. They didn't take long at all.,0.9129
14-Jan-22,I had wanted to try this place ever since it opened and I finally had my chance. My friend and I decided to meet up for an early breakfast and thought to give this place a try.  We arrived right at opening so we did not have to wait around for a table. As other reviewers have mentioned-- you place your order and pay prior to sitting down. Service from the wait staff is minimal once they bring you your food. We were checked on once and offered a refill on our coffee --but otherwise the young ladies were not very attentive. My friend and I ordered each the half order of French toast: she the house French toast and I ordered the  toffee banana.  My word ! It was delicious! It was a little on the sweeter side-but so good. The food sold me and I was convinced I would be back.Fast forward a few weeks I suggest we go again. This time we did not show up until about 10:15am or so...the long line out the door discouraged us. We considered that by the time we placed our order and sat down to eat it would be for all intents and purposes lunch time...and the menu here definitely leans more along the lines for breakfast. So long story short we did not stay because we simply weren't craving breakfast for lunch. Bummer!Will be back for breakfast and will order that delicious toffee banana French toast!,0.972
14-Jan-22,"I like this place!  I ate here for the first time last week, and I was pleasantly surprised.  It has a ""trendy/hipster"" vibe, but the food alone stands for itself.  When I first walked in, I like how open their dining area was.  Also, their bar area was nice and spacious with a couple of tv's.   Their system is order/pay up at the front first, then find any open seating.  I ordered their Popping Yolk breakfast.  And to my amazement, the food looked spectacular, and the food came out relatively quick.  The bacon was crisp, the eggs were cooked to my liking, (over easy) and their country fried potatoes are awesome!  They're like little diced pieces of potato deep fried to golden perfection.  It's like eating little cubes of crunch French fries. Now, I've eaten at other breakfast/brunch places where all you get are protein and carbs (hash browns, toast, etc.) and you leave feeling like you have to find fruit and/or a salad to counter balance what you just ate.  This place already gives you a salad that balances the entire meal.  A+ in my book. If you're ever in the the Alhambra/SGV area, this is a great place for brunch.",0.9932
13-Jan-22,"The food was phenomenal, so you ask why a three because the set up and the pricing. The price was a little expensive 20 dollars for one person. The staff is not very people friendly. But the cooks know what's up",-0.2304
10-Jan-22,"This is actually a really cute trendy spot. More of a young hipster type of vibe. Doesn't even feel like your in Alhambra. The guy at the front desk was really welcoming and nice. The place has a nice ambience to it. I will be honest, the food looks better then it taste. The plates are absolutely gorgeous looking and beautifully set up but the overall quality and taste, just didn't do it for me. There wasn't alot of flavor and tasted okay. I will say the chicken sandwich was probably the most flavoral thing and probably because we order it spicy. The potatoes were dry and lacked flavor, the benedict lacked flavor. The waffle was decent but once again more put together then actual flavor. I would still recommend going here and giving it a try. The cappuccino was really good. I would try it again.",0.9772
7-Jan-22,"If you are looking for brunch in the SGV (outside of Pasadena area), this is probably the closest one you can find in the Alhambra, Monterey Park, San Gabriel area.  Located in the heart of Alhambra Main Street, you can easily find free parking on the streets or in one of the nearby parking lots.While the pictures looked amazing on Yelp, I gave them two tries and they failed to wow me during both my visits.  Had tried their benedicts and sandwiches, while they were edible, they were not memorable.  The only thing I remember after dining at Popping Yolk was ""Why did I spend so much on that?""Restaurant is relatively small and have both indoor and outdoor dining area available.  Definitely don't recommend coming here with large parties, because you have to order and pay at the register and try to find a table yourself.  Maybe I am getting old, but if I am paying this sum of money for brunch, I expect full sit-down service.",0.754

5-Jan-22,"A good addition to Main Street, Popping Yolk is a destination location for brunch food. Their ordering setup is a little messy. The signs are confusing pointing to order at the front, but their is also a waitlist sign in. We waited in line and we're told we can't order yet until we sign in, then later after we were called up, couldn't order because their was a party ahead of us that hadn't checked in to order .. so here's the setup: 1. Waitlist sign in 2. They will call& text you 3. Then get in line at the cash register 4. Order, get a # card5. Find table We ordered the Norwegian Benedict and the berries liege waffle. I personally loved the little fried potato hash that comes with the entrees, so light and crunchy! The Benedict was delicious and well balanced and what you would expect out of a traditional Benny. The waffle was sweet, a waffle loaded with little chunks of sugar, loaded with fruits, Nutella, ice cream. Great for anyone with a big sweet tooth.",0.9866
5-Jan-22,"Hands down our new favorite brunch spot! They stay constantly busy but trust me it's worth the wait. This spot is good because there is something for everyone. They have taken brunch staples and made them extraordinary. For example, they serve 4-5 types of Eggs Benedict - this is often made horribly at so many breakfast places, but not here. I personally recommend trying them all. Can't miss = The deep fried french toast.Come for = MimosasRemember = The portions are huge! You can share.

3-Jan-22,"Underwhelmed. I really wanted to like this place. Especially since a location is going to open in Pasadena. The cafe has a beautiful interior and decor. The staff is friendly. The food plates are pretty when presented but the food itself is not that special. I ordered one of the eggs Benedict's because it is ""popping yolk cafe"" and thought they were experts at eggs but I was wrong. I was really surprised cutting into the eggs that it gushed not only yolk but water making for a very soupy combination and not exactly creamy and rich I expect from a eggs. The hollandaise sauce was good and so was the ham on the Benedict's. And the eggs were cold. Usually I'm not one to complain about lukewarm food but this was cold.  The bbq pulled pork omelet was terrible. The pulled pork literally soaked in bbq sauce and cold as well. It was sent back and the management kindly switched out the breakfast plate. This time scrambled eggs were ordered to keep it simple and I will say it was a lovely plate of hot scrambled eggs. They were soft, buttery and exactly how scrambled should be served. But I doubt we will be returning. Although their waffles do look delicious and if I do return, it's to try that.Just surprised by how popular this place...  and expensive... for not even having regular water service.",0.9831
1-Jan-22,"OVERALLPopping Yolk Caf√© is actually a really cool brunch place in Alhambra, CA. Their motto is ""good food is good mood.""ENVIRONMENTThe music is a mix of old-school to modern day hip-hop. Not edited for younger kiddos. Lol. It wasn't too loud so we could converse about our upcoming New Years plans.There were separate men's and women's restrooms. Mostly clean and well-stocked.The ordering process was a bit slow because this place was packed... Walk in. Wait in line. Use your phone for the QR code menu. The drink list wasn't viewable online (on 12/28/21).  THE GRUBTheir dishes may seem pricey, but, for example, the Florentine Benedict ($15) came with a side salad that was really good and even had corn and sliced grape tomatoes mixed in it. It also came with a large portion of diced, unseasoned potatoes. A little heavy on the cooking oil. This had to be a fluke because I've noticed how no one else has complained of this as of late. The Hollandaise was a bit bland.The half order of deep-fried French toast with toffee and bananas ($7.50) was also saturated with oil. My young daughters didn't like it at all. They make a pretty good ham and cheese omelette ($15.50), though. It also comes with the salad and potatoes on the side. My vanilla latte ($5.25) was really good. For my girls, I asked for two hot cocoas which were not on the menu - and they obliged ($5.25 apiece)! I was so stoked when they added their latte artwork to their cocoas too. Kids love that stuff.TIP+ They also serve beer, wine, and a small assortment of cocktails including mimosas. Cheers to the New Year!PARKINGStreet parking was not available on Main Street when I drove by. Instead we parked in a really small free lot less than a block away - behind the restaurant.

26-Dec-21,"Popping Yolk, where have you been?  So glad to find you right there on Main Street between all the Korean BBQ places in Alhambra.  Yelpers, this is a must-stop lunch spot.  Perfect pre-gaming before that cheapie movie seat at Regal Theatres down the block.  With yolk in the title, there's got to be an egg in every dish.  The breakfast platters are HUGE, absolutely a second meal in there if you don't mind lugging a to-go container around town.  Fresh toast and omelettes are first rate, the cute place is literally ""popping,"" and this crowd knows what time it is.  Want to be an outlier and order away from the brunch menu?  Well, it's one of the best cheeseburgers in town, complete with fried egg between meat, cheese and bun.  It's weird to order, and be asked to tip, before even sitting down, but that's the way it is.  Enjoy!",0.9339

23-Dec-21,"Came to SoCal for my birthday, a friend recommended this place to me so I gave it a try for brunch. I had the Norwegian Benedict and the Bacon and Cheese Sandwich, both extremely large portion which I didn't expect for the price. Everything nowadays is expensive for a small portion so it was nice to get such a large portion.The place pretty much for the younger folks, I'm pretty old now for the vibe but I can always appreciate good EDM music when I hear it. Kinda weird hearing rave music at a breakfast/brunch place but still gucci. Of course I was hung over but still willing to headbang to show respect. The food is actually pretty good too! As I said before portion is huge, yolk was poppin, salad was actually very nice, a lot of places always drown my grass with sauce but this one was actually very light and delicious. Highly recommend this place if you're good with the pop culture vibes. P.S cheers to the DJ who was in charge of the music, got a new song to my rave playlist.",0.9933
22-Dec-21,"Great food, GIGANTIC proportions. The food is so good but the salad has way too many dressing. Fair price for the amount you can get. I suggest you split one plate between two people.",0.7827
21-Dec-21,"Great brunch place in the middle of downtown Alhambra! Went for a Sunday brunch, and was really surprised that they had such a great variety of classic brunch dishes: from hot chicken egg benedicts -- to toffee nut banana french toast. We ordered two types of egg benedict's -- the hot chicken and the avacado -- and my favorite was the hot chicken benedict! Was a delicious pairing and the chicken was very tender and crispy. We also ordered the french toast which was my favorite part of the meal! It was definitely very crunchy and satisfied my sweet tooth. Definitely will come back!",0.9858
19-Dec-21,"Family Sunday brunch. Outdoor patio seating was available. Ordering is tricky as there are no clear instructions as far as we noticed on our first visit to this place. When you first enter the restaurant, there is a device to your left on which you add your name to the wait list. After you add your name, then you place your order. You will need to find a table after you place your order.  Today, the wait was about 50 min. Your order will be delivered to your table. The food was tasty!  Their home fries are well seasoned and crispy. The side salad is a great complement to the main course. I ordered the spam kimchee omelette and my spouse ordered the Popping Yolk breakfast. The family ordered the other dishes that are pictured. Parking is street parking or the parking structure one street over. It's a very busy place. The staff are friendly and efficient.",0.8687
19-Dec-21,"Food is good and ordered Benedicts from here many times. BUT! The front desk staff did his job terrible!! I placed an take out today and he just walks away after he simply asks ""are u in the waitlist or you ordered?"" My food was ready but he keeps me waits in line! Also he takes an hour to put an order!!!!!!!",0.3
18-Dec-21,Brought my mom here not expecting anything special. I was very pleased with restaurant. We ordered the Arugula Sandwich and Croissant Avocado Ham Sandwich. Both dish were fresh and delicious. Staff was attentive. Would totally come back with the family.,0.7867

14-Dec-21,"Popping Yolk Cafe is located in the heart of downtown Alhambra. It is a perfect spot for a good Sunday brunch. They offer a wide variety of eggs Benedict, omelette, french toast, sandwiches, burgers, crepes and waffles. You wait in line and order/ pay for the food before you are seated at a table. They have both outdoor and indoor seating. We tried the BBQ pulled pork Benedict and the toffee banana French toast. Both items were delicious!! I would highly recommend both. The portion size is fairly large. All savory items are between $15-$17 and the sweet items are around $12. They have a wide range of drinks from coffees to cocktails, beer and wine.If you are looking for a good brunch spot, this worth checking out. There is a public parking lot on 1st street where they have 4 hour free parking.",0.9739
14-Dec-21,The place is alright the wait was not too bad. We walk in and order our food and pay. Then went to go and sit down. The food was... meh. Nothing special I had the Nashville spicy chicken. Over all it was not good. The idea was there the delivery was not. They also forgot to give me my order and I had to wait an additional 20 minutes. But the reason why I'm giving it a 3 star rating the reason why I would actually go back was for the French toast banana toffee. That was absolutely delicious. If your in the mood for French toast this is the place for it. Wonder staff as well organized in the front needs a bit more help in the back.,0.943

11-Dec-21,"This local unassuming brunch spot in downtown Alhambra is a remarkable find. With a very welcoming interior and hospitable staff this makes for a perfect brunch spot. The menu is a combination of brunch favorites alike Benedict's, French toasts, crepes, sandwiches and waffles. The pulled pork Benedict was scrumptious and the toffee banana French toast was quite extravagant. The Benedict came with a side of salad and fried potatoes - the portion is large and shareable. The French toast is also a large portion - would recommend doing the half portion if you aren't super hungry. They have a spread of coffees and brunch drinks. All the food was reasonably priced for the portion sizes. You also pay ahead of time and seating is first come first serve basis. They have indoor and outdoor patio seating. Found this refreshing and it did avoid long waits with the wait staff on food. Also the best part is able to leave after your meal and not wait on a check :) Parking is plentiful and freely available in an one block radius from the restaurant. This is a great and resonantly priced option for brunch - definitely give this spot a try.",0.9797

9-Dec-21,Started going once the pandemic allowed outdoors seating. Food and service was good. Last few times the service was bad so we started ordering to go and it seems that something is always missing from the order. This last time we ordered eggs Benedict with avocado. When we got home there was no hollandaise souse. So sorry Thank you But No Thanks.,0.0368
8-Dec-21,"Great concept to have a breakfast-brunch place on Main st Alhambra. The interior of the restaurant was warm and cozy. You basically walk in, order at the counter, and then seat yoursel(ves) at any open table. They give you a number stand to bring with you to the table. My friend and I came on a Monday during brunch hours and it was, surprisingly, pretty busy. It was both of our first time here, so we didn't know the menu at all. As soon as we walked in, the waiter (with good intentions) told us to hurry and place our orders as he only saw 1 table for 2 available and another party just stepped in behind us. Because of this, we didn't have time to look through the entire menu. I quickly just chose something that sounded good from the lower right side of the menu - ordered the Berries Farm Waffles. My friend, also in a rush, ordered the Toffee Banana crepe -- yes, both sweet items from the same section of the menu. Each item was ~$12.Once we sat at the ""only available open table,"" we looked around and realized there were other areas (ie. at the side counter area) where we could've sat at. As such, we felt the rush by the waiter to be unnecessary. It took maybe 15 mins for our food to come out. The Berries farm waffles was decent, but the waffles themselves (without the toppings with it) was a bit too dry. The Toffee Banana crepe was wayyyy too sweet, thanks to the toffee and the  Foster Flake-like cereal that they put in it. We were not able to eat more than 1/3 of this. Definitely not worth $12. After we were sweetened out, we decided to view the menu again through pictures of the menu on Yelp as we were now craving something savory. That's when we realized that we both ordered from the same section of the menu and totally bypassed everything else. Fortunately, we were able to easily add-on dishes by flagging down a waiter/waitress or by going up to the front to order again. We ended up getting a Florentine Benedict to share. This was ~$15. The eggs were wonderfully creamy and smooth. Overall, this dish was above average. I also added on a latte as I haven't had my morning cup of joe yet. The latte was rich and satisfying. However, for a tiny cup, it's not worth $6-7. In summary, I'd come back again, just not very often as it is definitely priced on the higher end for what you get. It's a good place to grab some grubs while catching up with friends.",0.9955
8-Dec-21,"If I could give this cafe 0 stars, I would. First off, the overall cleanliness of this cafe was atrocious. When we first walked in the layout of the cafe was very cluttered with dirty dishes piled up in close proximity to where we were eating. There were also boxes of supplies lying around the cafe in visible areas. Then when we were seated, I noticed the table smelled like dirty water rag. I also noticed, the utensils looked and smelled dirty.When we got our food, while the APPEARANCE looks great, don't let it fool you the food is basic. I didn't think they could mess up a simple omelette (California omelette) but they somehow managed to do just thatI even ordered no mushrooms because I'm allergic, yet they still put it. They put an overwhelming amount of spinach which made the omelette soggy and undesirable. While the potatoes were okay, I didn't finish most of the food.Won't be coming back here again. You'll have better luck at the diner on main. :)",0.5631
5-Dec-21,"MAKE SURE TO NOT TIP THEM! ITS THEIR WAY TO TRICK YOU INTO TIPPING FOR THEIR POOR SERVICE AND BASIC FOOD.OUTDOOR DINING EXPERIENCE - Extremely terrible. Honestly one of the worst dining experience I've had. First their wait list you have to sign in and take a few minutes to answer security questions (weird). Then you leave and then get back in line to wait and order. Once we got seated to our table by ourselves outdoor, we noticed the environment was really dead. The food came, and the servers looked like they didn't want to be there. Customer service is extremely poor, it felt like they were workers at a sweatshop or 99 cent store. I noticed everyone who ate there was friendly and saying thank you to the servers. The servers were rude and don't say anything back to anyone. The utensils here are absolutely dirty with food stains. So make sure to check it!Once they serve you your food they will not come back and check up on you. I LITERALLY HAD TO CALL THEM TO COME BACK AND REFILL MY DRINK. The server came back and literally refilled every table for water, only because each table asked them. He was trying to walk away. MANAGERS TRAIN YOUR STAFF PROPERLY OR FIND TEAM MEMBERS WHO WILL DO THEIR JOB APPROPRIATELY. Not coming here again.",-0.8575
2-Dec-21,A solid brunch place in SGV as we don't have many good ones around here. The egg Benedicts were cooked to perfection. The crepes were also great. Orange juice was freshly squeezed. Can't complain about food. The service is on the slower side.,0.8444
2-Dec-21,"There are multiple free parking structures around the area and metered street parking or free parking. You order at the counter they will give you a number, and you wait at a table for them to serve your food. Everything we order there was amazing it was a perfect place to meet up with a group of my girlfriends. There are many tables high ceilings and the tables are spread far apart from each other. We order the hamburger with a fried egg, California omelette, deep-fried French toast with bananas. Everything was quite amazing! We also ordered a few items to go and we were Able to request what time we would like the food to be ready so that it would not be cold or soggy. They also have servers that walk around and continue to refill your water or drinks. The servers were very attentive, kind and courteous. It was a great place to eat at. Highly recommend!",0.9896

You place your order at the counter and find a table. They have bar seating, small tables, and community table too. We usually get the House French toast (1/2 order is great for sharing) and one of the benedicts. They are all yummy. My friend had an omelet the last time and said it was delicious. Served with side salad and crunchy breakfast potatoes. Service is nice and attentive. Great food, casual atmosphere.",0.978

22-Nov-21,"I have come here twice so far and very please with this place. I have tried Avocado Benedict, Norwegian Benedict, and French Toast. Between the two Benedicts, I like the Norwegian the most. Both Benedicts came with side green salad (very tasty and refreshing) and country fried potatoes (more like broken french fries but very crispy). French toasts are very crunchy and just the right amount of sweetness. I never had French toast like this before so quite interesting. The place isn't that big and only has couple big tables for large party.  They also have outdoor seating in the back.  You will have to order first then you will be given a number and find your own table.  The food took about 20 min to arrive. Depending on the time, there could be a wait for table. We didn't wait long since we were there before 10 am. All in all, very please. Definitely returning to try their waffles next time.",0.9789

We both order the full House French toast which came with 6 big slices so we were full with just 3. I enjoyed the crunch of the french toast the inside was my favorite very soft interior. I also ordered a vanilla latte and it was bigger than i'd imagine it to be :) Pretty reasonable prices with the quality of food and large proportions. Would definitely go again for the yummy french toast!!",0.9825

Keep in mind we were a small party and they could've checked what was missing on the table. We asked multiple waiters about the situation and no one gave us a direct answer lol. Everyone in the restaurant who were seated after us received their order and we never got ours until 15 minutes later.

12-Nov-21,"Came here on a Friday around 2PM-- not too busy during that time. It's one of those cafes where you order at the front and have your food brought out to. There was no one at the front when we arrived, and took a few minutes for someone to come and take our order but they were very friendly. I'd say they have a decent variety on their menu, however some of the prices were very high in my opinion ( ~$18 for a croissant sando w/ avocado?? T.T) We decided on the classic benedict ($14.5) and the earl grey latte ($5.25). At the time that we came, there were only 2 other parties there so the food came out quickly! I was excited for the earl grey latte because of the reviews and photos on yelp, but honestly it was quite underwhelming.. I ordered it iced and when it came out it looked nothing like the photos on yelp, it was like room temperature with hardly any ice. Later on I asked for a cup of ice to add to the latte and the friendly waiter brought it out immediately. At that point I was kinda over the drink but I do like how they have the tiny ice cubes lol. The classic benedict was good; just a standard eggs benedict. I enjoyed it. The potatoes were on the crispier side and were both unseasoned and a little too oily for my liking. The food wasn't my favorite, but good service and overall not a bad spot for brunch!",0.9891

3-Nov-21,"A bit different from what I was expecting. I came here thinking it was just your usual brunch place, but it is kind of unique. Its one of those you order your food and pay and then have a number to be seated type of place. Its a bit unusual because these kind of places usually don't have a wait, but this cafe is quite busy on the weekends.I got here around 11am or so on a Saturday. I only waited about 30 minutes before getting seated. They have a tablet at the entrance for easy check in. There's a quite a few places to walk around on Main Street so the wait doesn't seem that long. Once you are called, you order at the front, pay, and get your number + are pointed out to your seating area. This was during a busy time so I am not too sure how it works when it is not busy. I want to assume you just seat yourself. My boyfriend and I ordered the salmon benedict and the breakfast croissant sandwich. We also split a half order of the banana french toast. Let me start by saying the banana french toast was the best french toast I have ever had. Unlike most french toast dishes, this one was fried and breaded with panko breadcrumbs. So it was super crispy. We ordered too much food so we had to bring this home, and it still tasted good the next day.The Salmon benedict and breakfast croissant was pretty good. Honestly nothing too special, but each dish came with a nice serving of hash browns (more like french fries) and a salad. We tried to order the soft shell crab benedict but they didn't have it that day. Maybe next time!Overall, is this the best brunch place I have ever been to? Probably not, but was the food good? Yes!I may come back next time to try their other dishes. By the time I left, there weren't that many people in the restaurant, so if you come around 12pm there will likely be no wait. (:",0.9941

1-Nov-21,"People seem to like the Norwegian Benedict here but one of my yolks was overcooked and I find it really strange to use spinach that is not saut√©ed and cold salmon in a warm dish.

The French toast is soo deep fried it literally taste like crunchy cornflakes with grease. (French toast is not supposed to be deep fried btw)  The hasbrowns/potatoes are also too deep fried and greasy. I only chose this place because I saw alot of 5 star reviews.

My husband ordered their Toffee Banana French toast and he didn't like it either--which is saying a lot because my husband loves anything sweet. The salad that came with was also lackluster.

When I think ""brunch,"" this place is it. It has so many tasty and creative egg-based meals. So much variety. Our orders were prepared quickly and came in large portions. You definitely don't have to worry about leaving this place hungry. Both the Norwegian and Nashville Hot Chicken benedicts were amazing. The scrambled eggs here are so soft and fluffy. I don't really understand how they make them so well. Even the sides were incredible. The country fried potatoes were perfectly crisp and flavorful, with no hint of dryness; not once did I get bored of eating them. Given how busy this place is, the service is a bit slow so be prepared to wait. But I promise that your patience will be rewarded. The food is simply the best.",0.9772

Wait time wasn't too long, about 30 minutes, but if the place is busy, you shouldn't expect to be seated within 5-10 minutes. We ordered a few things to try out. The Mozzarella sticks were ok, they weren't that cheesy pull apart consistency. You could feel the sting cheese was still cold inside. My boyfriend liked them. I ordered the kimchi spam omelette. I thought it was good, but not worth ordering again. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes, but if you like them crunchy then you will enjoy them. The side salad was refreshing and I liked how they added corn. My boyfriend had the smoked salmon Benedict. It lacked flavor and there wasn't enough  hollandaise  sauce. He really liked the potatoes though.Lastly, we topped it off with something sweet. The toffee waffle. The best part was the ice cream mixed with the waffle. The waffle was a bit hard, but that's to be expected because it's toffee. I didn't like the fact that the bananas were over ripped. Overall the place was ok, I wouldn't go back unless my friends picked the place. I would actually rate it a 3 1/2 but it only allows three.",0.9922

I accidentally ordered the lox eggs benedict instead of the crab but it was still good, they are very generous on the lox with both the eggs bennie and the omelette- multiple pieces and thick-cut. I tried a bit of the BBQ pulled pork and it was a bit dry and the bbq sauce wasn't adding any extra points- tasted like the Baby Back Ribs BBQ sauce.So, so sad that I don't live around here but this was a spectacular find.",0.8894

I ordered Teriyaki Chicken Omelette, House Special Toast, and Ice Mocha. I gotta say I was impressed with how deliciously they wrapped the teriyaki flavored chicken inside the omellete. It also came with crunchy sliced potatoes and salad. All these items were perfectly mixed together and highly recommended!!! The house special toast was also very delicious and perfect for sharing as an appetizer. It was crunchy on the outside topped with various berries and moist on the inside. Since it was a really hot day, I made sure to pair my brunch with ice mocha. The coffee was very typical, but it did the job and gave me some caffeine boost.If you dont want any hassle, just park on the first street public parking lot.

I waited in a line for about 20 min and when I got to the front of the line I was turned away because I didn't sign in. No where is there a sign that says to sign in. It's ridiculous to wait such a long time and be turned away at the register when ordering.,-0.497
23-Sep-21,"Went there for breakfast. Wanted to sit outside, but was told their outdoor patio isn't available on the weekdays. Got the ham and cheese omelette - food was VERY mediocre and expensive for the quality. Brew coffee is refillable, but cost $3.95, was lukewarm and not hot! No one came around to offer refills. Comfortable indoor setting and I like the casual setup - you order at the front and food is brought to your table - but I don't plan to be back.",0.9104
23-Sep-21,"Fun, bright menu with tons of options to suit every party member. The coffee drinks are delicious but very heavy - next time I'll make sure it's not whole milk! It's an order-and-seat-yourself place with plenty of indoor and outdoor space, though you might have to wait for a table around brunch time. The hot chicken benedict and the french toast are STELLAR",0.8605
18-Sep-21,First time visiting Popping Yolk but definitely not the last one.Food was amazing every single dish cooked and prepared perfectly.This is a place I would highly recommend for Brunch. Great service and friendly staff. Even their side salad was so good its dressing had a nice kick to it. They have indoor seating and outdoor as well for those wanting to catch the sun! I believe they have other locations also not just this one in Alhambra.,0.9902
17-Sep-21,"This place is amazing! They have plenty of breakfast options, and the staff is really friendly. Had the eggs Florentine and my friend had French toast. Both were delicious. Only drawback is that it's so popular, there's a wait time and indoor can get crowded. They do have a small outdoor area, so it's a safer option.",0.969
15-Sep-21,"It was busy on the Sunday I went there. The wait time said 40-50 minutes, but it was closer to 30 minutes. The food was good and the service was good overall. I was there with someone and I think that elevated my experience at this place. I'd definitely recommend.",0.9382
15-Sep-21,Everything was great! However we would have preferred to sit down and look at the menu instead of having to order right away and decide on the tip ahead of time. Obviously 20% is the minimum but if service is incredible we would have liked to be more giving. It felt as if I was getting fast food.. im assuming they choose this way of working because of the high school kids? Idk it's weird and I was not fond of it. Service ended up being excellent. Coffee/ water was always full!  Servers were very attentive!,0.8991
9-Sep-21,"Popping yolk is a cute brunch place with tasty dishes that come in very large portions. I tried the eggs benedict and burger, which were both solid dishes. However, thr French toast here was especially delicious! Crunch, sweet and topped with fruits (or other toppings of your choice). The resturaunt has a unique layout. You order first and then they will bring your food for you. Even though we went on a Saturday morning, the wait time was not too bad (only about 20 min) to get seated.",0.9325
6-Sep-21,"The interior is cool. It has a relaxed vibe yet with good energy. I loved the wall paper and the plants.  We decided to sit on the communal table and a really nice friendly family ended up joining us. You order first before you sit down. Personally, I don't really like places that do that. I feel rush to order and decide on something. I like to be seated first and catch my breath, then look over the menu slowly.  Even though I've studied the menu before hand, I still felt rushed. Parking can be a bit of a challenge. We went on a Sunday morning around 9am just before the crowd hit. There is outdoor seating in the back but it was already 90 degrees at 9am yesterday so we chose to sit indoor. There is an farmers market down the street which is also why parking can be a challenge but the upside is you can go shopping at the Farmers Market afterwards.We ordered the Avocado Ham and Egg Sandwich and a regular coffee. I found their food to be on the greasy side.  Their French Toast is deep fried which personally I don't like because again, it's more greasy.  Their menu doesn't have a pancake option which I found disappointing. How can you be a breakfast place but not have pancakes?!!! You can order crepe but crepe is just not pancake. Can you tell I love my pancakes?",0.9023
6-Sep-21,"If I could give them no stars I would. This place is so unorganized. You aren't t told you get in a waiting list, you aren't told that you will have to order before sitting. After waiting for 20 minutes. A party of 10 that was 5th person on the waiting list goes in front of me. (All because the damn waiter didn't ask for the confirmation on their phone) Dod I mention the correct party arrived and they still had to wait, and they didn't apologize or said let me have your order. They just keep taking the others party order. what in the hell. I'm so fucken mad had to wait for another party of ten that was in front of me to get a table, after waiting for a fucken almost 45 min until these people got their life together, they call me just to make me wait 10 more minutes to order. What in the fuck is this? When I was about to order the cashier tells me ""oh by the way there's no more chicken"" after I order there Nashville chicken sandwich. At this point I decided to fucken leave. I will never give this place any more stars. They need to be more organized and actually take in to consideration that there's family with elders, they wait in their cars for a reason, and you don't even give them time to walk up the the damn place. McDonald's would of have me a better treatment then this damn place. Don't wast your time.",-0.8973
6-Sep-21,Worst place to come too! Don't even waste your time the employees are incompetent they have no organization! They jump parties ahead of you we waited an hour a freaking hour having parties jump ahead of you and we addressed it and still nothing was done! When we finally get to order they tell us there is no chicken what kind of dumb shit is that! That is your staple the fried chicken! We walked out after waiting so long it was the worst experience ever there is no organization the staff looks lost! Please don't go and waste your time in a place that has no clue what they are doing! Mc Donald's has better service then this place!,-0.9601
6-Sep-21,We arrived to a local AirBnB on a Thursday. Left Monday. Hit this place 3 times for breakfast. That should say it all.Great great great breakfast. Just pick something and it's good. We got:Banana Toffee WafflesBanana Toffee French ToastNashville Chicken BenedictTeriyaki Chicken BenedictSweet potato friesCalifornia OmelettePopping Yolk BreakfastAll excellent. You just can't go wrong here. I did think the coffee needed to be better for that price business but you can always hit the Starbucks on the corner if you want coffee afterwards. We did that after Day 1.,0.8904
28-Aug-21,"Visited Southern California for the week and wanted to try out a good brunch place! Based off the reviews and pictures this definitely looked like a place to try out!I typically love to order benedicts so we had to try them out! Each dish came in such large portions and comes with enough to get your money worth! However, the food itself was just average. Nothing too special or significant about the taste, orher then the nice plating and mix of colors with the salad on the side.The Nashville Hot Chicken was a good level of spice! Enough to feel it's kick but not too hot to the point where you're no longer enjoying your meal! We also ordered the Mango Iced Green Tea and the drink is A MUST, as it is also bottomless!",0.9246

23-Aug-21,"We arrived on Sunday @ 10:15 am for breakfast. We were placed on the waiting list. Initially we were told 20 mins. I walked in to check on the status of my wait and was told 5-10 more minutes and nothing. An hour went by and was informed still needed to wait. Sadly no staff or manager came to support the staff taking orders and placing people on wait list. The staff told another potential customer they could take a look at the electronic device that showed people on the waiting list, then told us he needed to take the order of line 5 groups of people in line. It was a horrible experience.  Not coming back. Poor customer service.",-0.5017
23-Aug-21,"Such a cute spot for brunch! The portions are HUGE. The plate is literally filled with your main dish, potatoes, and salad. The small potatoes are like small fries & it's really freaking good. We ordered the California omelette & the Cowboy Burger. Both were delicious. The California omelette had a TON of spinach in it & the pesto was really good.",0.9412
22-Aug-21,"started out rough.  Line, confusing set up.  You check in, then when you get the text you order at the counter and go find yourself a table.  They probably need to hire more  front of house.  But the food. Was. Amazing.  Worth it and will come back.  Excellent breakfast potatoes and the banana toffee French toast is inspiring.  Also, the whole place is very 'Gram worthy.  Food included. Back patio is much smaller than it appears!",0.9698
21-Aug-21,What a yummy find! Free public parking or street parking; order at register and food is brought to you. Generous portions; good menu variety; excellent service; reasonable prices and the food was delicious. Large tables are shared. Nice atmosphere. Would definitely return.,0.9808
19-Aug-21,The perfect spot for a cute brunch date or catching up with friends!Their egg Benedict is a MUST TRY !! The eggs were perfectly cooked and paired perfectly with the hollandaise sauce. We got the Avocado Benedict which comes with Avocado & ham with a side of salad and potatoes. The Ham & Sausage sandwich was simple yet so delicious! The egg was so creamy and was very filling! We love how they offer a half or full order of their French toast. The French toast was topped with mixed berries and had the perfect amount of crunch. Honestly one of the best Brunch spot in Alhambra so far!The ordering process was quick and easy. You order at the cashier then you're given a number and you can choose where to sit. They also offer patio seating in the back! Check out @bunbaosibs for more food reviews!,0.9915

17-Aug-21,"I finally was able to try the food. The service was much better than the first time I tried eating here but I must say I was not impressed with the food.  It was lackluster.The seasoning was blend and generally fire the prices, it just wasn't special. It was well cooked but bland.",-0.6925

12-Aug-21,"I love coming here to Popping Yolk for their delicious egg Benedict's and crepes! I've been here several times with friends and it hasn't disappointed! I usually just park in the parking structure a block away and walk over and there's usually plenty of parking available. The tables are all first come first serve where you order and pay first, then sit at the table or bar.I've tried their Norwegian Benedict and soft shell crab Benedict along with the berries farm crepe and crunchy honeycomb crepe. All the egg Benedict come with a salad and country fried potatoes. Norwegian Benedict: this egg Benedict had smoked salmon and it was delicious! This is my favorite egg Benedict here! The eggs are perfectly poached and the salmon tastes amazing.Soft shell crab Benedict: this came with two crispy soft shell crabs and they were pretty good. The flavor of crab is stronger so if you like that taste I'd highly recommend this one.Berries Farm Crepe: my favorite crepe here!! The crepe comes with cereal, berries, whipped cream, and strawberry and Nutella sauce. The crepe is filled with lots of cream so it's a pretty heavy dish but it's a delicious, guilty pleasure! A must try here!Crunchy honeycomb crepe: the crepe is filled with cream, honeycomb, strawberries, and cereal topped with caramel sauce. It was really sweet and really tasty but I liked the berries farm crepe a lot more.I tried my friend's toffee banana crepe and it was also good, but I'm not a huge banana fan so I wouldn't order that one. Overall Popping Yolk would be my go to spot for a brunch hangout because they offer delicious egg Benedict's and other brunch items as well. I'll need to come back to try their sandwiches and omelettes!",0.9932
11-Aug-21,"We went for some brunch because we were so hungry and were quite disappointed! Looks like the place is run by all young adults and they couldn't answer our questions about why there was no seasoning in the food. They just said they don't put any salt or pepper. That's the basis for any dish and they didn't add it. We ordered the soft-shelled crab eggs Benedict and the the crab tasted pretty fishy and the ""Cajun"" that was supposed to be on it, you could barely taste. At the very least, the staff should have been more prepared to answer questions about their own food or offered to bring the manager out but they didn't. The only good things were the potatoes but even those had no seasoning and were heavily fried.",-0.6618

2-Aug-21,"this place. Is worth every penny. Got the half order of french toast and the avocado eggs benedict, and OMG! three half slices of the most cinnamoniest, crunchiest, deliciously sweetest french toast i ever had??? And the most gorgeous eggs benedict with the tastiest hollandaise sauce ever??? Didnt think i would be quite so blown away from the food here! The packaging was lovely, and it came with the right amount of sauces, syrups, and creams. I love the spring greens that came with it. Altogether this costed about 24-26. I dont know if i can order from any other breakfast place ever again. Expensive, but itd take me a long time to recreate this at home, so totally worth! :D",0.9671

Except they forgot to put hollandaise sauce on my eggs Benedict. There were dirty dishes all along the kitchen counter.  There were very few servers hence the service was poor.  We had to hale down a serve for water, coffee and boxes.  I would give this place another chance. The food was delicious and our server was polite.",0.5267
29-Jul-21,"Wow... talk about a wolf in sheep's clothing... but i guess there are a lot of popular restaurants that aren't worth going to. We went to Popping Yolk and it was full of people... we thought it must be good...we ordered and were given our food (two people) at two separate times, over 10 minutes apart... UNSAT...Even Denny's serves the table all together, it's literally a common practice. As i sat there waiting for my friends food to be served i noticed there were several people in the same situation... SAD... I understand that this restaurant is successful, good... it'll continue without this patron...ONE MORE THING.... On a positive note, the service staff was very nice; food was cold...",0.9763
28-Jul-21,"I've been here a couple of times already and have always gotten their Classic Eggs Benedict. This time, I saw that they recently came out with a new ""Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict"" and I just had to try! I gotta say, I like this better!! The pickled coleslaw really helped to balance out the oiliness of the fried chicken. My only complaint is that it's not as spicy as I had hoped. I ordered medium, but it wasn't even mild- maybe I'll try hot next time! Also, portions are humongous!(:",0.6492
25-Jul-21,"This is probably the only brunch place in Alhambra and it's a winner! Good food! Large portions!I've been here multiple times and had a great time each.You order the food before you dine.

Overall the meal and service was solid.",0.5267
23-Jul-21,Such a neat brunch spot here in San Gabriel Valley. The food definitely gives off carefree & living the best out of life vibes . The perfect spot to gather some friends and just discuss adult life things with an eggs benedict. We ordered the House French Toast which was pillowy inside and an amazing crunch on the outside! Can't go wrong with a smoked salmon benedict & an omelette for that morning breakfast satisfaction Follow @foodphans_2.0 on IG for more foodie finds around SGV!,0.9822
23-Jul-21,"Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict: decent brunch spot! Their benedict comes with sides of salad and potatoes which balance the meal out well. I was excited for their new Nashville Hot Chicken item which I found to be decent. However, I don't think the flavor is particularly hot or representative of Nashville Hot Chicken afaik.",0.5848
22-Jul-21,"My family and friends have been raving about this brunch place being their new ""favorite"" so I was excited to finally try! Got their Florentine benedict and man it came with the perfect yolk. But on top of that I love that there's a salad to help make the overall meal feel not as heavy while having a ton of perfect little potato cubes! I love the size of them potatoes, crispy with just right amount of potato inside. My gripe with taking away a star was that my water cup smelled really bad...couldn't tell if it was the cup or the water or the ice...even after the waitress replaced it, mine still smelled, though my friend said hers was fine. So not sure what that was but made me not want to drink water..",0.9867

21-Jul-21,"Ordered take out just a few hours ago. Second time havingGetting take out from here. First time was last year when everything was closed and was only able to get take out. I have been in the mood for eggs Benedict, and so I ordered something completely new, being the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict, and half ordered of French toast for my cousin. It took more than an hour to get our order delivered, but it was well worth the wait!!I ordered the chicken spiciness level to spicy, and boy did they deliver. I love spicy food, so it wasn't THAT spicy, but because I didn't want to use the knife and fork, I bit right into it and smeared it on my nose a few times. My nose started  burning after a bit lol. My cousin really liked the way her French toast was cooked and immediately devoured it. I highly recommend the Nashville Hot Chicken Benedict if you're looking for something new a delicious to try!",0.9833
20-Jul-21,I wish there was a sign to check in on the waitlist iPad inside. Or place the ipad outside or closer to to the door so it's more accessible. Otherwise there's a line of people at the door so you may get confused and just stand in line like me and a bunch of other people did. You check in on the iPad and come back to wait in line to order before you are seated. Wait time on the iPad is not accurate. It said 100 mins when I checked in but the cashier said it's more like 20 mins. Cute little brunch place with big portions. The entrees come with potato's and salad. The potato's are cut super tiny so imagine eating an over cooked French dry. Salad is okay and refreshing with the entree. The California omelette is packed with ingredients. Only complaint is that it's a bit bland overall. It could use a little more salt. The Norwegian Benedict is served with a hefty amount of smoked salmon. The poached egg is cooked perfectly. Nice and runny when you cut it. I'd come here again to try the other items like sandwiches. The drinks here seem nice too so it could be a good place to catch up with friends over brunch,0.9884
19-Jul-21,"The country fried potatoes are extremely oily and they give you a lot. The Berries Farm waffle had actual large sugar crystals in it, I thought it was some nut at first they are so huge.

9-Jul-21,"We always see this place on main, so we decided to try it and were just pleasantly satisfied. We ordered the avocado Benedict,  popping yolk breakfast, and the classic Benedict. I felt that the popping yolk breakfast was kind of basic, so I wouldn't recommend getting it. We also ordered popcorn chicken, house French toast, calamari, and mozzarella sticks. We barely finished the food. Overall, coming to Popping yolk makes me want to try more brunch spots. Also their music choice was basically my playlist which was great.",0.8365
9-Jul-21,"The food and presentation is good, we ordered their signature breakfast and popping Yolk burger, the flavor is good!

Sean then proceeded to sit my group down with such a great vibe to this man. When we had ordered our food he came out of the kitchen with our plate of food in his hands putting up some great service which made a our meal much more enjoyable. This guy had given such great conversations and service that it was only right of me to give him a 20% tip. If you ever walk into this restaurant, look forward a guy named sean who will enhance the atmosphere of the building and your meal. I look forward to walking back into the restaurant and being greeted by sean again.",0.985

We had to put our names on a wait list and was given an estimated time of 135 - 160 minutes. The wait was long, but I've seen longer waits at dim sum restaurants nearby. Surprisingly, we only waited for 45 minutes since I guess people called out. The Food:You order the food first at the counter before you get seated at a table. Tasty and filling, you definitely get your moneys worth here. I always get the Norwegian Eggs Benedict, with eggs that pop with flavor. The side potatoes are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, a great accompaniment!",0.9551
6-Jul-21,"Have you ever been to a restaurant at 2:10pm and having a waiter first took their time to service you a table and when he finally came over first thing he said was ""just to let you know we close exactly at 3pm."" I know many restaurants will still service you even if you walk in before closing just as long as your order is in before the kitchen closes.  There were 2 other groups of people coming into the restaurant at 2:20 and 2:26 and the same male waiter turned away service to them and said take out only because they are closing soon.  Service is not only horrible but the food was really mediocre.  Felt ripped off with their waffle.  They actually used the same exact French waffle from Costco and worse thing was they didn't even take the time to warm the waffle.  I thought we were still in a pandemic where we are here to support small business and I assume the business values customers but instead to turn away business in this kind of times, I'm sorry to say that I will not come back again and will let all my families and friends know what a bad experience we've had today on 7/6/21.",0.634
6-Jul-21,"First, let's talk about food we ordered:Norwegian Benedict $15 - They do eggs justice at this place. The jiggly yolk pops at just the right pressure and runs down the salmon and English muffin at a perfect lava consistency . It was immediate comfort for the eyes and the mouth. Popping Yolk Burger $14 - My husband compared this burger to a similar version from Egg Slut. This one felt less greasy and heavy, but still super satisfying. The buns were soft but not soggy. The patty was thick and cooked just right. It was so filling that i was stuffed after eating just half the burger.Nonetheless, I couldn't stop munching on the potatoes that were part of both orders! This was the best surprise in my opinion. The potatoes were cubed in the perfect bite size for a perfect ratio of crispy exterior and soft interior. They were so irresistible! Especially when soaked in runaway egg yolk  I would come back just to order these if I could.Both dishes were of hefty portions. I barely finished half the order and took the rest home for a second meal. This was comfort food at its best.Also, everything about this place is so cheerful. From the comfort of the food to the bright yellow patio. The servers were a ray of sunshine. You can see their smile even through their masks. There was a small line when we visited, but service was still quick and easy. Parking was super easy too in the structures along Main Street.Overall: 5/5 If you're ever in need for a relaxing and comforting brunch, this is the place to go",0.9981
2-Jul-21,The popping yolk was not poppin... :( No air conditioning (in 90 degree weather) Salad was horrible no flavor.I asked for over hard eggs and then served me over easy. Wasn't able to change it because they had already brought out everyone else's food at my table and I had waited 10 minutes to still get my plate. Probably wont be coming back over priced for simple basic breakfast.,0.0243

The staff kept going outside and talking to their friends and did not help advise any good dish or any recommendations. I felt very lost and confused as this was our first time here .,0.8433
28-Jun-21,"What a great little modern breakfast spot in Alhambra. Be prepared with what you want to order before they call you for a table. You have to order and pay before you sit down. With that said I order the ice coffee, pull pork benedict and the french toast. Overall the food is really good and fresh but the reason for the 4 star is just due to the fact that I didn't prefer their french toast. It was crunchy and fried. My preferred a softer french toast.",0.703
28-Jun-21,"Cute little brunch spot in alhambra! I came here on a Monday around 12 and it wasn't busy at all and we were able to order ASAP! All the staff were super nice and wore masks. They did get one of our orders wrong (gave us the Benedict instead of the sandwich) but they were apologetic about it and got the right order out to us in 10 minutes. The food was delicious, my favorite was the house waffle! I just dock off one star because there were food on the floor and it seemed like they clean the tables but did not sweep leftovers from the floor. And I'm not talking about crumbs but like a piece of chicken LOL.",0.9835
28-Jun-21,"Seen the reviews and took a chance. Omg delicious!!! Very much worth a visit. They have a wide variety of selection. My sister and I had breakfast here after a hike and it was the perfect post-workout meal. She had the breakfast croissant and I had the Benedict. Both were equally delicious. Very nice set up as well, both indoors and outdoors. Servings are pretty big as well! You can definitely share a plate with 2 people, we only ate half of ours and took the rest for leftovers. Definitely recommend.",0.9873
27-Jun-21,"We were in staying the area and our friend recommended this place for brunch. It's a quaint little spot that offers a variety of options as well as beverages.We ordered the soft shell crab and teriyaki chicken Benedict coupled with their lychee sangria and mimosa. When we received our items, we noticed one was an omelette, so we waited quite some time for the one waitress tending to all tables to circle around to us. After pointing out their mix-up, she apologized and said she would get it sorted out.Their portions are massive and very appealing to the eyes. Their plates are literally filled to the brim, our Benedicts accompanied with a hefty serving of potatoes and salad. I found their soft shell crab to be very greasy and heavy, so I didn't take a liking to it.",0.7076

You order food at the counter and they bring it to your table later. I got coffee and the kimchi spam omelette without potatoes. They gave me double portion of the salad so that was nice. The omelette was good. It was very large and they were generous about filling it with spam and kimchi. They have both indoor and outdoor seating.,0.8104
26-Jun-21,"This place has been my go to breakfast spot since I moved to the sgv. The French toast is to die for and the entrees are always delicious. I particularly love the garden spring side salad and wasn't quite in the mood for a heavy dish today so I decided to order the full size salad and was promptly disappointed. I had ordered the larger size only to receive less. The side salad typically comes garnished with corn and cherry tomatoes, and I was really excited for the full size complete with an egg and cheese. But when it arrived it was literally just leaves smothered in too much cheese with a sad undercooked egg on top. No corn and no tomatoes. It was almost unpalatable and definitely not worth the price.",-0.7432
22-Jun-21,"There were so many dishes on their menu that sounded great, so it was really difficult to decide.  We went with the Spam and Kimchi Omelette, Norwegian Benedict, House French Toast, Popping Yolk Breakfast and the Classic Benedict.Everything was delicious and the portions were huge.The staff there was awesome.  Even though we sat way in the back, there was always someone that came by to check if we needed anything.Can't wait to come back and try some of the other things on the menu.",0.8228
18-Jun-21,"Got the luxury of visiting this cafe while I was in SoCal and lemme tell y'all something... HANDS DOWN BEST BRUNCH FOOD I'VE EVER HAD.You order your items at the front and then it is brought out to you after you find a table.They offering indoor and outdoor dining which is perfect for the summer weather. We ordered the Norwegian Benedict, Croissant Smoked Salmon Sandwich, and a half order of the House French Toast. Everything was *chef's kiss*. They had perfect poached eggs, super tender potatoes, and the hollandaise sauce was on point. The French toast was very fluffy and had tons of flavor. We also ordered orange juice and an earl grey matter which was all super good and so fresh! Everything was worth the price since they have very generous portions.I was told that they were understaffed but I didn't even notice since the food came out fairly fast and we were also being checked on.They have street parking available or you can park in a nearby parking lot.",0.9477
17-Jun-21,"BRUNCH FOR EVERY MEAL!!!! Popping Yolk came highly recommended from many friends so I was really excited to try it out. They were surprisingly busy on a weekday, but we managed to get a table out at their shaded patio area in the back.You place your order upfront and the food is brought to you later. We had heard great things about their Benedicts so we ordered the smoked salmon Benedict and spinach and mushroom Benedict as well as a half order of French toast! Oh and of course a mimosa and lychee drink. Service was super fast despite seeming like they were understaffed--the same guy who was working upfront taking orders was also the same guy cleaning up the tables. I really appreciated their speed though because I was ready to dig in to their generous portions!! To start us off, the French toast was absolutely amazing and I would highly recommend. It was so crunchy on the outside, but not overly sweet (the ultimate compliment!). I only wished it came with some more whipped cream and syrup to make it more decadent. The Benedicts were so filling. I loved the potatoes and salad, but I wasn't as crazy about my spinach mushroom Benedict. It kinda got all mushy and the hollandaise sauce was a little too creamy for my taste. I still scarfed the whole thing down though, with some help from my old friend Cholula ;).The drinks were okay but it wasn't very strong--I wish they had free refills but that never happens for brunch drinks! :D Overall, solid brunch place. I might opt for their sweets next time because they seem to really hit the spot!",0.9972
15-Jun-21,Their house French toast and house potatoes are AMAZING. I don't really like French toast all that much but the house French toast is most definitely the exception. A full plate plus a side of potatoes is good to feed two people.,0.8733
6-Jun-21,"It's been a while since I stopped by here. I was in the mood for brunch and by the time I got here at 10am on a Sunday, there is already a line outside. Once it's your turn, you placed an order with the cashier in the front then you can sit down. The food was great as always. The cashier was a bit rude when I asked for no dairy for one particular order because my mom can't have dairy. There was dairy in the scramble eggs in this case. I also asked if the sausage is pork or beef because my mom can't have beef. She replied in a cold manner that it was pork. I don't want to be picky or anything but a friendly attitude would be nice if you're working in the front line. Overall it's still a great place for breakfast and brunch. If you haven't been here, definitely try it once! I was able to find parking on the street but there is a parking lot available. They do accept credit cards.",0.9598
5-Jun-21,"First time here, let me tell you WOW! You get what you pay for. The quality of the food is pretty good, the flavors, quantity, efficiency, everything. Luke took our order, he was really patient on explaining what the food consisted of, he was kind and quick on suggesting what was the preferred and best seller. The employees here are nice and attentive on what you need to make you feel appreciated. You won't regret coming here. Thank you!!!",0.9854
4-Jun-21,"Super delicious. We had the banana French toast and the yolk burger. Both super delicious, filled with flavors, softness, melts in your mouth. The salad that came with the burger was super delicious. The ambiance is very chill. Great place for brunch. Staff is very cool.",0.9845
3-Jun-21,"I came to Popping Yolk Cafe for the first time about a month ago to have breakfast with my best friend; this was my first time dining at a restaurant post-vaccination. We walked in and I was looking for the outdoor seating which I had seen in pictures since I'm not yet comfortable with dining indoors without a mask. Their outdoor seating is out towards the back end of the building, but we had to place our orders prior to getting a table. Paying upfront seems to be the new thing to do, so I'm glad I read their menu on Yelp and was prepared before going there because I don't like to hold up a line. They have their menu menu taped to the counter so you have to bend over to read it (and mind you, it has fairly small print). Anyway, service was lightning fast. We had our drink orders within minutes of sitting down and our food was out in less than 10 minutes. This was a Saturday morning around 8:45 A.M., so we beat the 9 A.M. rush. The food was so delicious! I ordered eggs benedict which came with a side of mixed greens and the crispiest potatoes. My friend and I both enjoyed our experience here and will be coming back soon!",0.9774
2-Jun-21,"Amazing! I had never been here before and after I tried it, I had to go back. Few times I've gone I enjoy my meals and their lattes are delicious",0.8999
1-Jun-21,"The place has options to sit indoors or outdoors which was nice. Service is good and the staff is friendly. You also get big portions of what you ordered. So why four stars? The food was ok, I am not sure what they put on my omelet but it threw the taste off and it was really spinach heavy. My cousin got the salmon omelete and she really liked her meal and their potatoes are delicious.",0.9355
30-May-21,Finally found a really good eggs Benedict place nearby in 626. First time trying this place and it was really good. The restaurant has an indoor and small patio outdoor to be seated.  Great place for brunch.,0.8882
30-May-21,"This place isn't just aesthetically pleasing from the outside to the inside, but their foods were actually delicious. There wasn't any line on a Sunday morning (around 10AM on the 30th of May, 2021) so we got lucky to be seated right away. Take note: they take your order and have you pay first before you get seated.WHAT WE GOT:Classic Benedict - your good ol' poached eggs, ham, bacon, English Muffin, Butter and Hollandaise Sauce. The poached eggs were cooked to perfection (check out my video) and their hollandaise sauce was good and not salty at all. I loved it! Also, their country fried potatoes were amazing!Teriyaki Chicken Benedict - this has poached eggs, teriyaki chicken, spinach, butter and hollandaise sauce. That sweet and savory combo was on point and my husband liked it so much. It was good but I'm not a fan. Again, their country fried potatoes were amazing!Toffee Banana French Toast - I loved this french toast! It was deep-fried so it was crunchy, sweet but not overwhelming, the toffee sauce, maple syrup and toffee banana complented well with each other. I also like that they have an option for half or full serving of their french toast.Hot Chocolate and Japanese Green Tea Latte - these were a-okay. I would probably get coffee next time to perfectly go with the toffee banana french toast.Highly recommend this place. The vibe is so chill, servers were amazing and the food was great! Overall, we'll definitely be coming back!",0.9978
26-May-21,Wow! The crunchy French toast is absolutely delicious! Will definitely come back to try other items in the menu I!!,0.9173
26-May-21,"When you leave a restaurant feeling ripped off. The food here is bland- no salt, the poached eggs undercooked and raw. I'm so confused how heavily frequented this place is and how unflavorful the food is. The spinach left a bitter taste in my mouth. Wtf a huge salad no dressing lol me and my partner left our food after a few bites it was not a pleasant experience. Just WOW do ppl not have good taste in food these days and just look for overly portioned bland food?",-0.8001
25-May-21,"Okay I was thinking to do this review or not , but obviously I decided to do it. Few weeks back I went with a friend it was Sunday afternoon we get there and it was 3 couple already waiting for a table I don't know how long there were waiting but we were behind them and we wait over 30 min before we decided to leave , why ? Because they told us first come first serve, so we said okay , but we also asked if they take reservations for a future visit and the said no. I do understand when they work that way , after we wait over 30 min this fam of 5 or 6 people got there tried to cut line and a girl told them they  need to make a line to wait for a table like everyone else, so they were make a  line for 5 min when the daughter went inside and she called the rest of the family  saying they have a table!!,  which a short skinny (Asian) guy he wear glasses who work there give them a table right  away !!!! Why I don't know but I went and I asked HIM why he give them a table if they just got there ?!! And he told me because they make reservations!!! What?? Where ? How!! I mean you already told me you guys do not take reservations and now you told me you take ?!!! After 30 min I was waiting for a table ??? Well I called today to MAKE A ""RESERVATION "" even I email them and they told me they do not take reservations!, so what is happening?? I don't think is OKAY to give a table to your friends /family if it is a first come first serve restaurant. You as a owner needs to really speak with your employees about it , or if you the owner who do that which I hope not because the family seems it was they first time there. Anyway if you want to be treated like you can't paid or you are not important and they can sit whoever they want first even if you spend sooo much time waiting for a table ... go there ! Is your place.",0.9649

25-May-21,"I have had Popping Yolk Cafe twice. Once during the take-out pandemic era, and another time when indoor dining was available with limited capacity.Imo, the best thing on the menu is the Crunchy French Toast. I love when something is named with the word ""crunchy"" in it, and is actually crunchy! Their House French Toast comes with condensed milk, maple syrup, and a mix of blueberries and strawberries. Presentation is lovely, good for that IG story. If I had a choice to only order one breakfast item from the whole menu, this is it. I haven't had their Toffee Banana french toast yet but can only speculate that it's as delicious and satisfying.Soft shell crab benedict was alrighty. Was not blown away, but definitely yummy. I enjoyed the Norwegian Benedict much more, as the hollandaise paired with the smoked salmon oh so beautifully. My lust for salmon helped whet my appetite and wet my mouth. I don't care too much for their salad, but the portion size is generous. I do enjoy my potatoes; portion sizing is nice and generous as well. I also had some of my girlfriend's sandwich, which she requested to have with croissant bread. Having that option to upgrade was a plus. Had orange juice to drink, refreshing and hit the spot for a late AM meal. They do serve mimosas, wines, cocktails, and beer here. I shall order that next time I'm not up late the night before partying hard lol.I recommend getting here e a r l y. My girlfriend and I waited about 15 minutes right before the lunch rush started that Sunday morning. We sat inside and were attended to quickly as we got our waters. You could tell the staff was scurrying a bit as the line got super long and there only seemed to be one person attending by the cashier. Some opted to order to-go due to the wait. They do have outdoor seating here as well. If you're here after 11:30ish, be prepared to wait.Definitely will come back here to try other menu items, but also for sure their french toast.House French Toast - 5.25/5 starsNorwegian Benedict - 4/5 starsSoft Shell Crab Benedict - 3.25/5 starsOrange Juice - 4.33/5 stars",0.997
21-May-21,"Saw it on Yelp! with all the good reviews, I made a point to have breakfast here. This place is on Main Street that's west of Garfield where a lot of restaurants are located in Alhambra including the famous ""The Boiling Crab"".I think Popping Yolk Cafe is new to the restaurant roll in Alhambra. Despite being new, the cafe is popular. We had to wait a bit before been served. I am glad we came. The food are fantastic and big portion. Even though the prices are on the high side, but you get what you paid for. From the food arrangement and the way they cook the food, I can tell the people here really put an effort to provide good food. The fried eggs in my Popping Yolk breakfast came in a cute round shape and cooked to the right temperature that left the egg yolks soft. The diced potatoes were fried to perfection resulting in crispy golden brown potato cubes, very tasty. The egg Benedict was also amazing. The yummy sauce really elevated the whole taste of the dish. The only flaw was that the bacons were too salty in the Benedict. If they would have used hams, then the dish would be perfect. Drinks are good too. My wife had their green ice tea . The restaurant also has a patio in the back for dining. Although it's small, it's nicely decorated and painted in bright yellow. There is public parking structure behind the restaurant on the next street.",0.9938
18-May-21,"Awesome little breakfast/brunch spot! Second time here and will definitely keep coming back. Had the soft shell crab Benedict the first time which was different but really good. Second time I'm glad I went out on a limb with the Norwegian Benedict, amazing!! The portions are generous and the staff is super friendly. Definitely a gem!",0.9904
17-May-21,"I would have given them five stars, but we had to ask three times to multiple waiters over ten minutes after everyone else's breakfasts came for my banana toffee French toast. They did try to make up for it by giving us a free entree, but not until our next visit. No explanation for the mess up.The wait wasn't too long (20 minutes) to get seated on a Sunday morning. You order your food and pay for it upfront. They then take you to your seating that was thoroughly cleaned, but would have better if they dried it too...seats and tables were still wet.The food was excellent and the eggs ""popped"" on the two Benedict's. The Horchata Latte was really good, orange juice was fresh squeezed. The Banana Toffee French Toast was awesome when it finally came out, but could have used more than just a drizzle of maple syrup. I would come here again just for the French toast and Benedict's.",0.9769
17-May-21,So delicious  they were nice they just forgot to drink the Tabasco which sucked but the food was soooo good maybe put heaters outside. The food was 5 stars!! The orange juice is 10 stars,0.7802
16-May-21,First time visiting this cafe for a morning breakfast run. We went based off of reviews from fellow Yelpers and ordered top ranked menu items. The curbside pick up was seamless and the staff were friendly. Our order was made right in time no delays even with the morning rush. All our food was made fresh to order and held up on the 10min drive back to the hotel. It was all great! Delicious crunchy French toast with a soft center topped off with the syrup and toffee syrup. The eggs Benedict were my favorite and came fully loaded. The portion sizes and quality of food is well worth the extra dollars.,0.9595
16-May-21,"Popping Yolk is definitely one of my favorite breakfast places. My family and I order at least one time a month. Every time I have called the staff has been very nice and patient, despite my millions questions. Every meal is super fresh and the portions are very generous. I recommend the soft shell crab Benedict, the  crapes, and any of their breakfast sandwiches. Sometimes my family get the crepes to share, it is a nice way to end our meal on a sweet note.If you have a little one, my son loves the waffles.    Their eggs are cooked a little under done, so if you don't like that ask for them to be well done.    Happy eating!",0.9885
10-May-21,"Great little breakfast-brunch spot! Not as cheap as some breakfast places out there, but everything I've ever ordered here has been generously portioned... as well as being very tasty. My favorite is the egg salad sandwich. Why? It tastes a lot like Asian-style fluffy egg salad! No celery bits or any other additions. Just eggy goodness! The potatoes are also very crispy and delicious, and they hold up very well even when I do takeout. Most entrees also come with a nice side salad.They do have some patio dining out back, for those who would like to eat at the restaurant. Parking is a tad annoying in that area; I recommend just using the side streets instead of trying to park out front.Can't wait to come back, either way.",0.9876
10-May-21,"So happy LA dining is opening up again, my friend and I were looking for a brunch spot to catch up and Popping Yoke POPs up on Yelp nearby!  The wait was 40 minutes on a recent Saturday morning, so definitely come early if you are hungry. They will text you when your table is ready, so my friend and I decided to walk around Main street while waiting.  They have a very nice outdoor dining and also indoor dining with distance and limited capacity.We shared a full order of French toast, love the crunchy batter on the outside!  My friend and I also shared the pulled pork omelette, which came with a side salad and roasted potato which was really good. It was way too much food for the 2 of us, but I'm glad we both were able to take some home for our hubbies to try. Next time we will definitely bring them along to try more dishes. My matcha latte was smooth and not too sweet, and my friend ordered the  mango ice tea.What I really like is how when your table is ready, you ordered and already paid in the front.  A number is placed on your table and your food is bring out promptly.  This overall reduced contact with your servers and gratuity is already taken care of. I know restaurants now have to come up with protocols to keep their workers and customers safe while staying in business, I definitely appreciate all the new standards Popping Yolk have implemented during this crazy covid times.",0.994
9-May-21,"The eggs Benedict was good! Hash browns are not salted which I prefer. And they give you a salad too, unusual but good. The dressing was good but the lettuce was a little dirty tasting. The waffles are different. But I liked them. Crispy and a little sweet. Didn't even need syrup.",0.9299
9-May-21,Yummy place. Go early. Good service when I went but sounds like it's spotty. You pay first + tipping so I'm glad our experience was good today. I would suggest to work on getting the food out at the same time for everyone. I've been there twice with just two people and the wait in between dishes were very noticeable both times. Good Covid Protocol.,0.9579
8-May-21,"It's amazing. I went there for sun brunch. It's pretty packed when I got there, boy is pretty nice and told me to put on wait list. I can tell there food must be promising that's why it's so popular. Wait it about 20 mins and order soft shell Benedict, French toast and California omelette, fresh oj and Earl grey latte. When we got the food, wow, so pretty, camera eat first haha. Soft shell crab is so crunchy n fresh. French toast is my favorite, my friend told me he try waffle last time n so good too. Portion r huge. I really love the environment, super recommend popping yolk cafe.",0.9952

Kind of used to it at this point, so I just tell myself patience is a virtue.I must say it was completely worth the wait! I ordered the Norwegian Benedict and the sauce is the best part - perfect taste and consistency! I also love how they balanced the dish with your country fried potatoes to get that crunch and also a light vinaigrette salad to balance out the other heavier tastes on your plate.Definitely can't wait to come back and try the other items on their menu!",0.9129

7-May-21,First time trying an egg Benedict and was sooo good! I can't compare it to other places cause I've never had it. Order by the counter and then grab the number and choose your seating. Mimosa was a bit small for the price and there was a lot more orange juice than champagne.,0.69
7-May-21,"We will see how the food tastes but the phone order process was terrible...called 3 times 3rd time they answered was told 15-20 minutes at 1035 arrived at 1055 and didn't receive my food until 1121. Almost a half hour late and now I'm late to appointment so don't have time to eat it at home like I intended. Also food reciept was posted 1109 so I'm guessing they didn't care to make it when I had originally ordered. First experience here and so far I think I'd recommend to go elsewhere for phone orders. Terrible service in that regard. Hope the foods half decent when I eat in my my truck now. Thank you guysAlso they don't greet you when you come in and when you ask how much longer for your already late order they look around lost and then didn't ask anyone and said oh it should be sometimeSoon.

4-May-21,"Pandemic review.This used to be one of my local brunch favorites.  But the staff needs customer service reeducation and coaching. Kitchen and food was good as per usual. I hyped my mom up because they have amazing French toast.  Their toffee banana French toast is crunchy with a hint of sweetness. Perfect for most Asian parents.Much to my disappointment, the service was like dealing with passive aggressive teenagers being forced to do chores.  No eye contact, unwelcoming, and unapologetic to their mistakes.  I've been here on multiple occasions and their service wasn't spectacular but you can tell the staff was new to the workforce.  No fault to that.  Everyone needs to start somewhere.  But my most recent incident really showcased the lack of proper customer service etiquette.  We placed our order with the boy who wasn't particularly welcoming but nbd, we ordered.  Then the coffee my mom ordered arrives.  The plumper girl places it on our table in silence and walks away with a standoffish vibe.  At this point, I'm silently pleading these two get their act together so it doesn't ruin my mom's first impression at my favorite brunch place.  My mom mentioned the service was off.  My lame recovery was ""Ooh...maybe we just can't see their smiles through their masks and they don't have smiling eyes.""  Then here comes the kicker, we poured the ""fresh"" milk into coffee and it immediately starts curdling and looks like egg drop soup. FML.  We asked the boy to come over and he has the nerve to tell us, ""That's just how its supposed to be.""  We were like uhh, this is not how it's supposed to look.  So after some back and forth he brings another coffee with the same milk. We poured it in and AGAIN, coffee egg drop soup.  Again, the boy says ""yeah that's how it is. "" By this point, I'm sure the inventors of coffee are probably tossing and turning in their grave.   Super frustrating as the girl with the stone cold scowl comes a little closer to see and again their tone is unwelcoming and completely unapologetic.  As if they're trying to brush us off for giving them trouble... instead of you know, apologizing and bringing over a cup of coffee where actual cost is pennies.  SMH.  We all stare in silence as my mom stirs the egg drop coffee, which was a lost cause.  Longest 30 seconds of my life.  Until the girl finally says flatly, we have half and half creamer.  So finally,  third cup of coffee brought over by the boy, this time he breaks character from his zombie like composure and says he hopes this time it's better with a chuckle.  Half and half creamer saves day.  Food was great per usual.  They have indoor dining and outdoor patio dining in the back.  Street parking or parking structure across the street.  Our  experience was terrible, ruined by the unwelcoming service.  We will likely never come back.",0.9172
2-May-21,"First time back during COVID.  The have both indoor and outdoor dining. Came here on Saturday around 830a. No lines. We sat outside. By the time we left at 10am, there was a line. All the staff wore masks and have precautions. I had eggs Benedict florentine and the earl grey latte. The portion is generous and I couldn't finish the potatoes.  The meal had me full all day. Wonderful flavors on the eggs Benedict.  Hot Earl grey latte is already sweetened with mild flavors. All in all a good breakfast place.",0.8442
2-May-21,"Tried the Popping Yolk Cafe for brunch, it is only opened until 3 PM daily. There is an indoor part of the restaurant and outdoor part of the restaurant. This place gets really packed and really busy, unfortunately there is no Yelp waitlist to check in early prior to your arrival, but there is a waitlist app that they use. Last arrival is 2:20/2:25 PM, if you don't get seated before then, you are SOL and have to come back another time. The way that this place works is, regardless if you are ordering to go or ordering to dine in, you order at the cashier and pay for your food. This is no problem for To-Go orders, but for dine in orders it gets complicated. If you pay with credit card and you tip with card, you have to tip prior to your dining experience. So if you tip 15% but you get no service, then oh wells. This is not a good system for dine in because I paid and tipped on card, but unfortunately there was something that ran out and had to pick something else or cancel that item. So this complicates the tip because most people tip on a % of the food cost, so you could potentially over tipping due to canceled or just poor service. Service here is okay, I had my water refilled once, and that's it. The food brought was untimely because one order came out really early and another order came out much later. The first person was practically done with their food while others waited for their food to come. The food itself is just okay. I don't think there is anything special about it, the toast presentation was nice but everything else was just okay. The potatoes were really dry and hard, think over cooked french fries, and the scrambled eggs tasted undercooked for some reason. Salad is bland as there is no dressing on it. There is no dedicated parking lot for this place, but there is a dedicated parking structure that is shared among multiple businesses in Alhambra. The closest one is on First Street North Side behind the Charlie's Trio. The parking there is free, avoid first floor because that's only for like 24 minute parking. Go up one level and it's like 4 hours free parking.",0.905
24-Apr-21,"Simple but soooo good. Their meal incorporates eggs into their dishes hence popping yoke. A great place for brunch if. Portion are pretty large. I always have leftovers when I leave.

First, you place your order at the counter and then they give you a number to place on your table. Service was excellent! They brought us water without even asking. Thats a plus in my book! Everything was so good but the house french toast is definitely a must! Its crunchy on the outside and not too sweet.",0.9563
19-Apr-21,"Amazing food. I had the House French toast and I asked for condensed milk and maple syrup on the side so I have the control of how much I put in and it was perfect.

19-Apr-21,popping yolk cafe is a super cute and aesthetic cafe with locations in both hacienda heights and alhambra! its the perfect place for a brunch hangout or date.we tried the avocado benedict and fell in love with the perfectly poached egg. the crunchy potatoes were a perfect side to contrast the benedicts.we also ordered the popping yolk burger which was cooked and seasoned to perfection. i loved how the sauteed mushrooms complimented the egg and beef patty. the smooth brioche bun brought it all together in perfect bite. i loved that it wasnt too heavy and i didnt feel greasy after eating it.my favorite part was probably the freshly squeezed orange juice. i could literally taste how fresh and sweet the oranges were. and it just elevated my meal to a whole new level. the hazelnut latte was really aromatic as well.and if youre a fan of sweets then you have to get the house french toast. it kinda reminded me of a funnel cake. the tart berries were a good balance to the sweet french toast. it is a little on the sweet side so make sure to bring your sweet tooth.,0.9968
17-Apr-21,This place is really cute to get a nice brunch. There plates are descent portions. What I love about this place is there egg benedict. I ordered a vanilla latte hot and for me it was way too sweet for my taste. French toast was good very crunchy!,0.9476
11-Apr-21,You have to order before sitting down. Food tastes delicious and looks amazing. Staff are friendly and restaurant looks clean. Three stars because they don't have a baby diaper changing station in either women's or men's restroom. We had to leave our food and come back after changing our baby in the trunk of our car. This ruined our mood mostly because this was our first outing as a family with our two month old baby. I had been eyeing this place since I was pregnant and couldn't wait to try their food. We even arrived at 7:40am to make sure we were one of the first customers there so we could leave before the place got crowded.,0.9042
8-Apr-21,"One of the best French toasts I've had. We also ordered the soft shell crab Benedict and pulled pork omelette which were both ok. OJ was also freshly squeezed. Indoor seating was a bit dark and decor was just so so, but they have a back patio area too.",0.4939
5-Apr-21,"Been eyeing this Cafe for the longest time and finally came on a Monday for lunch and was pleasantly surprised with how fast my food was made. I sat at the outdoor patio but they also have some space available indoors.I ordered the Norwegian Benedict $15 and the Strawberry Bellini $8.50, the total for both including tax was about $26. Norwegian Benedict was very tasty!!!! Portion was huge and I loved the crispy potatoes that came as a side. The mixed green lacked dressing and flavor but I was so full from the benedicts and potato, I didn't care much for it. The strawberry Bellini seemed expensive for the amount I got.Service was great! All staff wore masks and were very polite. It's nice to be able to sit at a cute cafe like Popping Yolk to enjoy a quiet brunch. Will be back to try other food items!",0.9859
1-Apr-21,"little price, but very generous portion. French toast has too much oil, but benedict was pretty good chocie overall.",0.933
29-Mar-21,I outdoor dined in here a couple of months ago. They did a great job of separating the tables and distancing people to maintain the COVID safety guidelines. Our server was super friendly and obliging. The food came out quick and was both delicious and visually appealing. The food was a bit pricey but the portions make up for it!,0.8639
29-Mar-21,"Their service is outstanding and super good food! Our favorite server was Channel, we are super high maintenance and she catered to our needs with a positive attitude. We loved our experience and highly recommend this place!",0.9827
27-Mar-21,"Called ahead, they said it was about a 30 minute wait but you can't put your name down until you're physically there. When you get there, you order first then you get seated with a number and they bring you your food. They have outdoor and indoor seating, the decor was nothing special. I got the mimosa for $8.50, not worth it. I got the classic breakfast $13, some bacon was crispy, others weren't, the sausage wasn't tasty, had mostly a fatty sausage flavor, potatoes, some pieces were good, others were over cooked, might have been better if they added onions and bell pepper, salad was good, light dressing on top, $2 for 5 slices of avocado, not worth it, half order of French toast was good. Tastes like brick toast, more of a sweet dessert than breakfast French toast... As for me, I probably wouldn't go back. It's over priced. If anything go for French toast as a dessert, go somewhere else for breakfast.",0.9676
24-Mar-21,Craving another omelette and decided to check out Popping Yolk's. Had their California omelette to go - overall tasty but not memorable. The two sides - salad and fried potato were also just okay. Brunch is just much tastier when dine in. Will try again when dine in returns to normal.,0.3291
23-Mar-21,"It was my first time here & the staff was very good at keeping things cleaned & sanitized . The breakfast sandwich I ordered was really good , the potatoes tasted a little too oily for my liking but overall I would totally come back again (:",0.8535
23-Mar-21,"This little spot is so delicious! The food the drinks the everything was bomb! I really loved the French toast, we only got the half order to share between 4 people and it was not enough we should of got the full order cuz omg the best! They're known for their eggs Benedict dishes but pretty much everything is so good! You won't be disappointed! The only thing weird about this place is having to order and pay ahead of time... that's it! But overall 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!!",0.9629
23-Mar-21,Came here to celebrate my brother's college acceptance and wow we've found our new favorite breakfast place. The french toast was so crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside we INHALED it. We also ordered the Norwegian Benedict and everything was just right and well balanced. Get there during actual breakfast time and there's very little wait. This place is SO worth it!,0.9271
23-Mar-21,"This is missing one star only because of a neighboring business' construction immediately adjacent to the outdoor seating. The service was very good. You order at the front then get a number and the food's delivered to your table. They messed up our order but that was probably due to the jackhammering going on in that moment. Thankfully that part of the noise was over fairly quickly. They fixed everything immediately and were very attentive without being intrusive. We sat inside (first time in over a year!) It was not busy and there was plenty of open space and both back and front doors were open allowing for some ventilation.The prices may seem a little steep but the portions are enormous. Next time, I could probably split the Classic with a friend. The eggs and bacon were perfect. Their outdoor space is cute and not on the sidewalk on Main St. We're looking forward to returning, esp when construction's over.",0.9601
22-Mar-21,"We visited on a Saturday around 12pm and since it was the first weekend of dine in, it was no surprise that it was packed and busy. Although it was busy, tables were socially distanced from other parties and servers were running around making sure customers were getting their food and drinks in a timely manner. Chanel was the server who took our order, and was very nice despite it being so busy. She was ringing up orders person after person and let us know about the wait for our takeout before placing the order. She told us to come back around 25-30 minutes and when we came back, our food wasn't quite ready so we waited outside. She was very apologetic but didn't have to be! We totally understood there was a wait and didn't mind since we did come in peak hours on a Saturday. Not even 5 minutes after waiting outside, she personally brought out our takeout for us and gave us a drink on the house for the wait. Overall, just GREAT customer service! The packaging for the food was secure and they still gave out a good portion of food. The house French toast was so good!",0.9728
21-Mar-21,"Super cute place ! So glad we found this place, it was a lot more than we had expected it to be. Visit was on 3/20/21.You order before you sit down so be ready . They have the QR code on their doors so you can check out their menu ahead of time. We ordered the Norwegian Benedict, (Full) French Toast, and the club sandwich. We were so surprised with what it came it. Both Norwegian Benedict and club sandwich came with potatoes and a salad. Everything was so delicious !! Highly recommend the French toast, it was so crunchy and soft all at the same time. The berries that were topped on it were fresh and it was a perfect balance. Norwegian Benedict was also amazing. If you're a fan of smoked salmon, HIGHLY RECOMMEND! My boyfriend was also a fan of the club sandwich. Service was great and everyone was so accommodating. The service was pretty fast. The Benedict took longer than the other two things but that's because it requires more time so no big deal. They were busy pretty much the entire time we were there. But worth the wait. They do offer take out, outdoor dining, and currently indoor dining. They have an outdoor patio in the back. And they are following COVID guidelines very well. Tables are well spread apart and requires mask when entering.  Limiting capacities but they are offering take-out ! DEFINITELY VISITING AGAIN !!",0.9901
21-Mar-21,"Loved their food First time trying but will definitely go back! Ordered horchata latte, toffee banana French toast and soft shell crab egg Benedict over the phone and they were ready within 15 minutes.  Pick up was easy if you can find a parking space right in front of the store.  Need to go inside to pay and get food unlike some other places where you can pick up at the door. You can order via Postmates or Yelp too.Food tasted great even after reheated in the toaster oven. The potatoes were crunchy without reheating! They packed the sauces on the side so it's easier to reheat everything. Salad dressing was a bit sour but it helped to balance out the richness from the hollandaise sauce. Loved everything and will def be back to try other egg Benedict dishes!",0.988
21-Mar-21,"Delicious food. Relaxing space. It's a decent size location, I highly suggest coming as soon as they open, they can get pretty busy on Saturdays and Sundays. Weekdays are the best, the pace and service is good. I recommend ordering the horchata latte if you enjoy something sweet and milky with caffeine, to balance it out order any of the Benedicts. You do get large portions of food which is great for the price.",0.9834
16-Mar-21,Went here for Sunday brunch and thought it was really nice that there was a brunch spot in Alhambra! Don't be fooled by the front area because they do have outdoor seating in the back with lots of shade and secluded from the public as well. You would have to order and pay first in the front and they'll give you a number for your food as you wait in the back area. I ordered half an order of the Crunchy French Toast and I really like how they give you an option to get half/full. Sometimes I dont have the stomach to eat a FULL order of French toast AND more lol so that's really thoughtful. I also got an order of the Norwegian Benedict and the BBQ pulled pork Benedict. I think overall the food was pretty okay but nothing to really rave about. The fried potatoes were my favorite from the dish!,0.9359
13-Mar-21,There are not a ton of breakfast options in Alhambra so this place gets rather busy on the weekends. This review will be entirely about their crepes which are very subpar and do not taste like crepes at all but rather like burnt sugar with lots and lots of heavy cream.   I really like to save my calories for delicious food items but this crepe was a waste of $13 and 1000Calories.  The crepe part was very hard and crispy and the inside was extremely sweet.  Stick to the sandwiches and eggs.,0.6768
13-Mar-21,Must try! We ordered Avocado Benedict and Norwegian Benedict and absolutely loved them both. Potatoes were crispy outside soft inside. So yummy. And the French Toast? Wow! Best tasting I've had. We had it with the condensed milk on the side only because I don't like it too sweet. Worth the 30 min wait!,0.9664
11-Mar-21,"If you want to reward yourself with an excellent yolk experience , great foods, punctual Service and always tasty and fresh, in hopes you choose Popping Yolk Cafe for your dining experience. This place has fire terps #FIYAH",0.9382
8-Mar-21,I was craving for breakfast foods and stopped by this place for the first time around 10:30 on a Saturday. The wait for outdoor dining would be 45 mins so I opted to get takeout. I ordered the Popping Yolk Breakfast. Everything tasted good but the sausages were completely raw and gooey. Can't say I dislike this place but it's going to be a minute before I come back since I was served raw pork.,0.5067
8-Mar-21,"With restaurants allowed to be opened once again for outdoor seating dining, we had the opportunity to pop in on Sunday. Yes, this place takes credit cards; they even accept AmEx!So how does it all work? You order and pay for your food up front. Once that's completed, a number is given to you and you walk yourself to the back where they have their patio seating. Seats are first come first serve. Some tables ae only 2 seaters while others are 4 seaters. So if you have a large party, this might not be the place for you.The patio area isn't that big. Half of it was tucked into this 3 sided wall area. While the other half of the patio dining area was outdoors, with a covering overhead to block out the sun. I do not believe the tables were 8 feet apart as mandated by LA County Health Department (""...tables must be spaced at least 8 feet apart when measured from one table edge to the next table edge."").  I know some people may not care while others find it as an requirement when dining out. So do what you will with that information.I ordered the Berries Farm Liege Waffle. This is definitely for those who have a sweet tooth! Not to mention, ice cream for brunch anyone? Yes, please! The portion may not seem huge, but it is hearty. And for those of you who have never tried a Liege Waffle, you're in for a treat. It's not soft in texture like the regular waffle. And it slightly resembles that of a Belgian waffle. It's a bit difficult to describe. But get it!As for the staff, they were friendly and followed COVID protocols. They all had face masks on. Some even had face shields and gloves.  It's unfortunate that we're not at the dine in level of the tier. Their indoor dining looks like it would be amazing, the perfect brunch ambiance. Can't wait to be back once all this pandemic is over and done with!",0.982
7-Mar-21,Come here for takeout orders for Avocado Benedict and Salmon Smoke. The food was soooo amazing! I like how much they give out their fried potatoes. The place is so generous haha! Definitely coming back here for sitting- in experience for brunch to try more dishes! :),0.968
28-Feb-21,"Nice breakfast place. The eggs Benedict were delicious. They made a mistake on my breakfast. However, it was quickly rectified, to my satisfaction with a phone call and a return to the restaurant. It was an honest mistake and they were genuinely sorry for the error. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed my breakfast and would try them again.",0.8481
22-Feb-21,"Came for a brunch date with my boyfriend and we absolutely loved it, the scrambled egg on my bacon, egg & cheese sandwich was so soft and delicious as well as the buns, the portions are exquisite and will fill you up quick !

I get there and I wait in a single line mixed with people ordering, waiting to be seated, and people picking up food orders. There was no organization at all. By the time I got in front of the line it's been an hour since I ordered my food and my food was received cold because it's been just sitting there. Learn how to manage the line. I Paid for cold food.",0.0772
13-Feb-21,"So delicious!! We loved everything about this place and it was reasonably priced! The French toast is to die for and a half order is a great way to taste and split with a friend / partner alongside your meal. We both got Benedict's, the classic and the avocado, and we agreed they were amazing. Lots of hollandaise, perfectly cooked and presented. The sides of crispy potatoes and garden salad were generous portions and delicious!! Also-- we dined outside during COVID and the service we received was wonderful.",0.988
12-Feb-21,This has been the best French toast I've ever had it was amazing. I'm not a sweet breakfast type of gal I'm more of a savory type but omg I loved this French toast. I crave this place.,0.8628

9-Feb-21,"Came here for my birthday 2/8. There were a lot of options on the menu, but I went with the popular egg Benedict. I got the soft shell crab Benedict while my boyfriend got the kimchi omelette. He also got the lychee Taiwan beer while I got the mango green tea.There's seating in the back and we got to sit in one of those high chair table tops. We didn't wait too long for our food to come out and it looked amazing. The Taiwanese lychee beer was surprisingly good! I thought it was going to be beer with a hint of lychee, but it straight up tasted like lychee juice with a hint of beer (I love sweet beer because I'm not a beer person lol). It was honestly really good and I would definitely get it again.The mango green tea was AMAZING. I loved that you can really taste each of the ingredients that were in there. Plus it comes with free refills! Sometimes the mango is too overpowering, but they got the mix just right. I highly recommend getting it if you have the chance.My boyfriend's kimchi omelette was actually really, really good. I thought that there were going to be only a few pieces of kimchi on it but much to my surprise, there was TONS of kimchi pieces in the omelette. The spam paired really well with the kimchi and the spicy sauce that they used was amazing too. The potatoes and the salad that came on the side tasted great. I liked how the potatoes were cut into cubes and EACH of the potato cubes were crunchy!Again, I got the soft shell crab benedict and I can't say that I absolutely loved it. The eggs were cooked to perfection and over a piece of bread, much like all Benedicts are but the soft shell crab was not a winner. In fact, I took a huge bite of the bread, egg, and crab all together and gagged a little bit. It tasted like I swallowed a bunch of sea water. I tried it again (apparently I just like torturing myself) and again, it just wasn't good.I ended up taking both of the soft shell crab in the benedict and just eating the egg and the bread. If I'd known what the crab was going to taste like, I would have saved myself the extra $5 and just gotten the plain one.All in all, I liked the atmosphere and it's a cute little place, but I wouldn't completely write off this experience. I would come back but not order anything with the soft shell crab.",0.9989
11-Jan-21,I enjoyed my experience here because the food was delicious. The customer service was a a 4/5 due to a lack of under estimating the wait time by over 30 minutes. The food tasted fresh and I was served a very generous amount! I was satisfied with the quality of the food and I would certainly return again.,0.944
31-Dec-20,"I absolutely love when I can bite into french toast and hear the crunch! This french toast was super crunchy and although it was deep-fried, it didn't feel heavy at all! Topped with fruits and syrup, the french toast was the perfect sweet breakfast meal. I personally preferred the classic house french toast, but the toffee banana was a delicious combination! I ordered the full serving, but they also offer half orders too. The croissant avocado and ham sandwich comes with potatoes and a garden spring salad! The garden spring salad was a refreshing addition, and the potatoes were crispy and delicious! The eggs were nicely cooked and all the ingredients in the sandwich worked perfectly together! Absolutely delicious! Portion sizes are generous and prices are reasonable! Amazing restaurant for brunch",0.9936
31-Dec-20,"I am so happy that this brunch place is local to an area dominated by Asian restaurants.   I can take so much hot pot places and boba places.  Don't get me wrong -- I love hot pot and boba but this girl needs some variety!  I needs me a local BRUNCH place and this place is IT.  I had come here pre covid for lunch with a girlfriend.  I had the Popping Egg burger, protein style, with a double helping of salad.   It was really good burger but I wanted to try something else before writing a review.Fast forward to covid times, we had delivery from Popping Yolk.   This time I had their Classic Breakfast and it was simple but so freakin' good.  I am absolutely an egg fanatic.  A soft boiled egg makes everything better.  In this case, everything was perfect.   The buttery scrambled eggs,  super crispy country fried potatoes, crunchy bacon, fresh greens adorned with buttery corn, and savory maple grazed sausage.  YUM.   The toast was a half of a slice but who cares when you got the rest!I am so thankful that I don't need to drive to anywhere west of DTLA to enjoy this sort of meal.  :)",0.9957
30-Dec-20,"The aesthetic of Popping Yolk Cafe was ADORABLE. It seems really small at the entrance, but they actually have outdoor seating at the back of their restaurant. It's so cute! I asked the cashier which dish she recommended and she said that a popular dish was their Norwegian Eggs Benedict and I went a ahead and ordered it. It has poached eggs, smoked salmon, spinach, english muffins, butter, and the hollandaise sauce. It also came with a salad and the best country friend potatoes I have ever eaten. It was crunchy but soft on the inside. I would've liked for the eggs benedict to but hot, when it came out it was warm and the yolk wasn't runny.",0.985
23-Dec-20,Support local businesses! Happy they haven't shut down. Main St. has seen a lot of businesses come and go but I think Popping Yolk will be here to stay. Prices are on the higher side for your typical breakfast food. No issues with taste and quality of food. Portions are good. Will say their French toast is BOMB. Definitely comparable to Blu Jam cafe. Just way more accessible for people living in the 626. Definitely think that's one of the dishes that will keep me coming back even if prices are on the higher end.,0.7385
21-Dec-20,"This is such an unique breakfast joint in the sgv. They have delicious French toasts, egg Benedict's and fresh orange juice. Since the pandemic, we have dined outside in the patio and other times have ordered take out. The food is solid and I hope people continue to support this cute little restaurant!",0.9432
18-Dec-20,"First time trying Popping Yolk and it didn't disappoint -- I loved the balance of sweet to salty brunch items as sometimes picking just one is too difficult. My friends and I came for outdoor dining back in November, and it was spacious spread-out (more than 6 feet). Although, some of the tables were more cramped than others, but overall, it was still comfortable regardless. If you're looking for a good quality brunch place, I highly recommend giving this place a try! FOOD: (4/5) - kimchi spam omelette (kimchi got a little watery towards the end, but great blend of flavors from the spam and egg)- house french toast (LOVED the crunchiness from the crush and softness from the bread) *favorite item*- Norwegian Benedict- popcorn chicken (not many brunch spots serve this so when we saw this on the menu, we knew we had to order)DRINKS: (3/5)- Lychee White Sangria (was a little too diluted for my liking, wish there was more sangria taste) *didn't really taste the lychee either, unfortunately*",0.975
13-Dec-20,"This place is located in a yellow building on Main Street- you can't miss it. The interior is sleek and modern. I wish I had the chance to dine it but that will have to wait! We ordered a California omelette, classic breakfast and a half order of french toast. The California omelette and classic breakfast comes with a side salad, small diced potatoes and half a slice of toast. Overall, both are pretty good. The french toast however did not live up to my expectations. The coating that they used to make the french toast overpowers the bread. I felt like I was eating panko crumbs instead of actual french toast bread. Other than that, this is a very cute brunch place with good breakfast foods.",0.9737
13-Dec-20,"The best place to take your love ones to brunch. Here @poppingyolkcafe are recreating some of your favorite brunch classics like eggs benedict, french toast, and delicious crepes!

30-Nov-20,"There is a lot of turnover on Main Street, sadly even more so during Covid. With that said, I have had Popping Yolk on my bookmarked list since they first opened. However, I avoided stopping in 1. because I was never certain it was open for business and 2. I didn't want to fall in love with their food just to have them close down.Last week, my fianc√©' and I happened to have some extra time in the morning and decided to walk Main Street in search for brunch. We took a chance and popped our head in expecting that if, only take out would be available. To our surprise, we were greeted by a friendly women who indicated they were indeed open and there was outdoor seating in the back. We placed our order at the counter in the front of the restaurant and we were guided to seats in the back outdoor area. The seating was well spread out and the d√©cor was quite minimal but very cute. There were a couple other parties eating but luckily we weren't close enough to hear their conversations. We were really looking for a quite spot to spend quality time conversating and enjoying good food. Before we knew our food was being served to us. We had ordered the Popping Yolk breakfast (eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, and mixed green salad), French Toast (the full order...which is a ton of food, plenty for sharing), Japanese Green Tea Latte (matcha), and a Mango Iced Green Tea (with refills). Everything was seriously tasty and satisfying (check out my photos). We left very full and happy.So glad we took a chance on Popping Yolk. We would have never known that they were open with outdoor seating and such delicious food. We were pleasantly surprised by how quick and yummy the food was. Service was on point! Looking forward to our next visit.Thank you Popping Yolk!",0.9947
28-Nov-20,"Been eyeing this spot since they opened. Glad I finally got to try brunch here, even if it's during Covid-19. The downside: we couldn't sit in their cute interior space and enjoy that good AC. The upside: we were able to enjoy their cozy and uplifting outdoor patio, along with our brunch. This is what we ordered.- Norwegian Benedict- Avocado Benedict- Berries Farm Waffle w/ Vanilla Ice Cream- Strawberry Bilini- Lychee White SangriaOur Berries Farm Waffle with Vanilla Ice Cream came out first. We were hoping to share that as a dessert, after our meal, but they probably thought we wanted it as an appetizer. I mean, of course we ate it without complaints and it went very well with our drinks (Strawberry Bilini and a Lychee White Sangria). If you'd prefer your waffle as a dessert, make sure to let your waiter know when putting in the order. The waffle was crispy, and the whipped cream & ice cream served with it was on point!By the time our main entrees came, we were already stuffed. The sizes were ginormous, so we practically took half our meals to go. The benedicts were both yummy and absolutely reflected the name ""Popping Yolk"". It was a fun and hearty brunch. I had amazing company, the food and space was welcoming and also comforting. Popping Yolk Cafe is a great place in Pasadena for a hearty meal, good drinks and to catch up with friends.",0.9953

8-Nov-20,"i was really excited to try their french toasts, so we ordered a full order of the house french toast and a half order of the banana toffee french toast. we were disappointed by both. the french toasts were so oily and didnt have the texture of a typical french toast. i would not order the french toast ever again. we also order the bacon and cheese croissant and that was good. the potatoes that came on the side were tasty and not mushy. the california omelette was decent. it had a good amount of vegetables, but wasnt seasoned so it was very bland.we do not plan on dining here again",0.4012
5-Nov-20,"We ordered brunch takeout from Popping Yolk last week. Pickup was easy since there were available curbside spots.* Soft Shell Crab Burger: Good amount of crab! But the egg didn't work too well with it - the egg and crab might've been more cohesive without the burger itself.* Farm Berries Liege Waffle: Great quality liege waffle, it's been a while since I've had one. I noticed that some other reviews said it doesn't taste like a normal waffle - and that's because it isn't a normal waffle. Liege waffles are filled with caramelized pearl sugar and they are DELICIOUS. I was surprised that they included two waffles in here. I actually struggled to finish the second one.",0.9073
2-Nov-20,Great spot for brunch. They have a little space towards the back where you can sit down. Order the egg Benedict and their sangria. The white was sweeter then the red but both was refreshing. Services was excellent.,0.8225
31-Oct-20,"The food is average and pricey.  The Norwegian benedict was cold. The BBQ Pulled Pork benedict had no bbq flavor and was also cold. The potatoes were also cold. We waited for the pick-up, so not sure why the food would be cold. The Popping Yolk burger was alright. I wished the Cowboy burger had more flavor. The hollandaise sauce and salad dressing were tasty. The salad was really fresh. Presentation and food packaging were great. I had high hopes for this to be really good from reading the reviews.",0.8819
26-Oct-20,"Came with a couple friends for brunch on a Sunday at around 12PM and were told there would be a 30 minute wait. We decided to leave a number and kill time nearby at the Farmer's Market. They actually called us back in 15 minutes which was great.  As you enter the restaurant, you first order at the counter and then head to the back patio for a table outside. However, we noticed that the tables definitely are not 6 feet apart - I understand that the space is small but we felt a bit unsafe being so close to other diners. I ordered the Classic benedict ($13.50) which comes with the standard poached eggs on english muffins with ham and bacon, a refreshing side salad with citrus dressing, and the crunchiest yummiest potatoes! Loved this dish and would definitely come back for it as the portion size is huge and the presentation is beautiful. I also got a half order of their House French Toast (3 pieces for $6) to share with a friend. Honestly, we did not like the texture of this at all and would not order it again. It was overly fried and tasted like oily carnival food. Service was fine although we did have to ask multiple times for water refills as their glasses are pretty small. I would probably come back after COVID though since the tables were a bit too close in proximity for our liking.",0.9898
24-Oct-20,"Upon entry, you have the option to dine in at the outdoor patio or order takeout. Your full party needs to be present to be seated. They said  it's because the food comes out fast and It's true! My friend arrived, we were seated quickly, and our food did come out fast.The outdoor patio is cute with a bright yellow wall!I ordered an avocado benedict and she had the kimchi omelet. Mine was so good I didn't even think to snap a pic. I just scarfed it down. It came with sides of salad and potatoes. The potatoes were crispy! I liked the salad once I spread the dressing around - gotta have the greens, amirite? The staff was attentive and helped us out with more water, ketchup, napkins, and a to-go box. Thanks for a wonderful brunch and look forward to my next benny :D",0.9857
24-Oct-20,"This place was good! I came on a Saturday morning around 11am and the wait was 5 minutes. The food came out really fast. I got the normal benedict and my brother got the salmon benedict. My mom got the breakfast combo. We also got the latte, espresso, and strawberry bellini. The drinks and food were 10/10. It was overall really great..the potatoes were crispy and bitesized (super cute). All plates came with a salad. My mom mentioned that she wishes they asked if we wanted condiments since she didn't get any butter, salt etc for her food..her's had bread, sunnyside eggs. Also when we came out we saw a couple of tables that weren't cleaned up. Butttt overall i would come again if im ever back in the area!",0.6229
23-Oct-20,"Let me start by saying: You can park at the Mosaic Parking Structure on 1st & Main and walk a short block to the establishment. Met a girlfriend and walked in together. The entire establishment was aesthetically pleasing. Super IG worthy; cannot wait to dine in once the pandemic is over to take super cute photos with the food. It is currently order at the counter, pay and pick a table in the back patio. The menus are displayed on large screens and super easy to read. I ordered the Norwegian Benedict and my girlfriend ordered the classic breakfast with sunny side up eggs. Paid, tipped and walked to the back patio to pick a spot. The back patio was spacious and socially distanced. The decor was totally cute and loved the IKEA flair to the joint. The food came out promptly. My order looked great but my girlfriend's was even better. I didn't check with the ordering staff if they used baby spinach, because the benedicts arrived with fully grown spinach, which can be tough and bitter. I had to pull it off and push it aside. The lox used was just okay. I personally wouldn't order this one again. Patrons respectfully distanced themselves from each other and the experience was enjoyable. Price for quality is fair: 4/5Parking: plentiful in nearby parking structuresService: minimal but gave us everything we needed Can't wait to return to try the mango green tea and omelettes!",0.983
22-Oct-20,Really good food ! Enough to give for one person . Food prices are bit pricy but I guess if you want to have good fancy breakfast this the place to go with a mimosa,0.798
21-Oct-20,"This place is AMAZING! I've heard about how good their food are from many people and I decided to finally try and I regret not coming sooner! First off, the French toast was very crispy and had a good amount of syrup that won't drench it to make it soggy! Also since it was fried I was afraid it might be a bit oily but it wasn't at all. I also got Norwegian Benedict and I LOVE IT ! The portion is very generous! And the potato was cooked to perfection just crispy enough. The egg and the smoked salmon were just so delicious. Also as a plus, the presentation of the food was very nice as well. The staff was also very friendly and made sure to fill our drinks up very often!  Would definitely be coming back very often!",0.9946
18-Oct-20,"What started to be a midway point and patio criteria turned out to be a pleasant surprise. :)  I ordered the Avocado and ham croissant with sunnyside eggs.  Portion size was unreal for the price.  I was expecting maybe just the sandwich and some greens?  Oh no, add a whole half plate of potatoes.  Had I known, I would have asked for all greens on the side instead.  I gave it 4 starts beause of the following:- included mayo and butter?  Shouldn't that be an ""add"" and not removal from your meal?- did not ask insteada of postatoes that I would have ability to substitute for all greens instead (as i ended up just wasting that food because I skipped more carbs- original french toast was yummy, but barely had any powder sugar AND skimped on the fruit.  Even though I had half portion (which was 3 pieces), why would they sprinkle powder on only one piece instead of all 3?  just a bit odd if you ask me....Even with above, the meal was yummy and portion size you could split if you wanted to order tomse crepes or fresh toast.  Servers were polite and maybe when I was there with my friend it was not as busy but all patio seats were taken -- so I would call that busy these days. I did want to comment on their ""clean restrooms"" that had automated sensor for grabbing the paper towel - however, would suggest moving the trash can closer to the door so that you can wipe your hands, open the door and then toss out the trash -- all without having to touch more surfaces. This was a surprising find and it was a hidden gem in my book.  I would definitely try it if you haven't and live close to the area or if passing through.",0.9797
18-Oct-20,"We have been waiting to try this place with my family. Today it was the 3rd time we dined out since the pandemic. I know I am a very picky person, but I would expect all restaurants to have a very high cleaning standard since the pandemic. I didn't feel comfortable sitting in the outdoor patio without masks because the tables were not 6-feet apart. I was sitting right behind from another person behind us. And the place doesn't feel clean entirely. I went across the bar. Their wine glasses were oily and dusty. I understand they don't serve their guest with wine glasses probably, however I don't think they should be left out without cleaning. The fire alarm battery in the outdoor patio was out and it was beeping once every minute.Food- we ordered 4 items: eggs Benedict, berries crepe, French toast and waffle. Eggs Benedict was ok and French toast was decent. However, when we switched out the potatoes that came with the eggs Benedict, they also switched out the salad as well. So my husband ended up having a plate of French fries with his eggs Benedict. The cashier didn't mention that we would not get any salad. The waffle and the crepe each came with a scoop of ice cream and they prefroze their scooped ice cream! I didn't even touch it because it was not appetizing. My son took two bites of the waffles and said it was too sweet. My crepe tasted dry and old, and it has way too much whipped cream. It simply didn't taste good. We were disappointed with the food and the whole experience.",-0.6354
18-Oct-20,"Finally got to come here after all the times we've said we would try it out. We came in around 11:30am & was only a 5 minute wait. I like their system of ordering & paying before being seating. We ordered lychee white sangria which was sweet, fruity & delicious although not as strong in alcohol nor did it give me that white girl buzz but definitely would recommend it! I ordered the smoked salmon omelette which was honestly very good. The omelette itself was seasoned well with smoked paprika. The smoked salmon was very tasty & cooked perfectly. The spinach & mushrooms were very earthy & everything complimented so well together. The potato cuts were crispy & lightly seasoned. The salad had some type of citrus dressing that was pretty good. The toast was just like any toast with butter slapped onto it. My husband ordered The Florentine Eggs Benedict, which came with two poached eggs, perfectly cooked but was lacking salt. It came with a salad and fried potato cuts.We also ordered the French toast (half). It was the one dish I was truly looking forward to but was disappointed in. It wasn't that it was a bad dish, it was just very dry & lacked maple syrup. I prefer my French toast (or pancakes) drenched in maple syrup & maybe I should of asked for it on the side but I assumed it would come with it already. I would definitely have to give it another go but this time with more maple syrup. This place offers outdoor seating in the back patio which is small but spacious, their restrooms are very clean & the service here was very quick.",0.9951
18-Oct-20,"Great food, convenient for pickup. Was a fave before covid and still is. A side order of the french toast is an amazing desert to go along with the eggs Benedict",0.8957
17-Oct-20,"Updated review:Due to this pandemic, outdoor seating available in the back of the restaurant. When you walk in, place your order first and they will provide you with a table number for food to be brought back to you.  Parking: two public parking structures available. Plenty of street parking to come around.  On a sunny Saturday afternoon, they normally take reservations however we called in advance to see if they can accommodate a party of three last minute and sure enough they were able too. I have not been here for over a year and a few months because my first experience wasn't so pleasant . I decided to give this place another try.The french toast! Comparable to blu jam cafe! The house french toast is amazing! I got the full portion to split the dish and it is crunchy and sweet but not too sweet.Crab Benedict! Must try! The crab came out super crunchy , the dish was very filling and  savory. The sauce was buttery and the egg was cooked perfectly! Loved the side potatoes and salad that it comes with!",0.9786

Everything from the packaging, the organization, and the FOOD is phenomenal! I discovered Popping Yolk during this lovely time period known as COVID. Therefore, I was sort of disappointed I couldn't experience the ambiance of the indoor seating! However, that's all changed!!!!!! They now offer outdoor seating! So of course, I had to check it out and really enjoy a nice sit down breakfast meal!!! Oh lord! I was even more satisfied! I didn't think it was possible since they've exceeded my expectations.Anyways, I cannot stress it enough.... this needs to be added to anyone's breakfast spot! I'm a faithful customer of their Classic Benedict, comes balanced with a side salad & crispy potatoes!!!",0.9367
16-Oct-20,"This is now my new favorite local brunch spot. We were interested in having a quick brunch and thought we would end up having to go to Pasadena. After looking at the reviews and pictures, we were wondering why we never came before. Maybe COVID, maybe just not going to the correct spots in SGV was the issue. Anyway, summary is: great and friendly service, great food and awesome mimosas. We had the kimchee omelet and a half French toast. Omelet was amazing and came with a nice arugula salad with corn/tomatoes and crispy potato cubes. The half order of French toast was more than enough to satisfy our hunger. Finally, we were pleasantly surprised to have a bottle of French sparkling with fresh squeezed orange juice (using those fancy machines we first saw in France). The outdoor seating area is well done and very inviting. This will be our new go to spot!",0.9914
14-Oct-20,"The food was mediocre, nothing special but I gave 3 stars because their social distancing protocols were not up to par. None of the tables were 6 feet apart in their tiny patio. I had a person literally sit right behind me and I just wanted to get the heck out of there especially since we aren't wearing our masks while eating. I'm sure the person behind me was feeling uncomfortable too.",-0.0846
13-Oct-20,"Was looking for a brunch place that had outdoor seating bc of COVID. I was confused by reviews of the place and details because the front looks very small and not enough room for many patio tables!! But there's actually a back patio where they have tables outside, so that was nice. It was just SUPER HOT, though, because there are huge cement walls that don't allow for any breeze to get in/through! They don't take reservations and seating is limited, so we had to wait like 20min. You order at the front and bring your number to the back to your table to wait for the food. Food presentation was incredible!--and food was tasty.  Beer menu was super limited (only like two beers right now!?), but I was happy they had mimosas. Overall nice experience, and everybody had masks and tables on the patio were decently spaced apart, but I'd come back on a cooler day.",0.987

We had breakfast for lunch and ordered a pulled pork omelet and half size French toast (this was a lot for two people). Only thing that didn't go well together was that the pulled pork omelet had a lot of mushrooms. I didn't think the taste of the mushrooms went well with the bbq sauce and pork. Otherwise, they cooked the omelet well and the French toast was super crunchy. It's not a regular style but coated (maybe panko) and deep fried. Lots of sugar, but you're ordering French toast so it's expected. The potatoes were crispy with fluffy insides - perfect, devoured them all. They also said they do drinks to go but we were working. Definitely want to try other menu options!",0.9504

Seriously, I wish I could make my eggs as perfectly as they make them. Everything I've had from here was yummy, yummy, yummy! My favorite is the Hawaiian burger. SO JUICY. SO DELICIOUS. If you want healthier options, they make great salads, too. So glad we have this place in our neighborhood!",0.9912
25-May-20,Was looking for a place that prepares smoked salmon for breakfast and was so happy to learn this restaurant not only makes smoked salmon breakfast croissants but also smoked salmon omelettes. My friend and I tried one of each and we're very satisfied not only with the flavor but also with the size of the portion. Each item included a salad and breakfast potatoes. The dressing for the salad was so delicious. I also ordered a fresh squeezed orange juice. The prices were very reasonable for the quality and freshness of the meals. They definitely gained a couple of new clients today. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu. The food was ready quickly after I placed the order. Highly recommended.,0.9879
14-May-20,"Visited for the first time during the Covid-19 lockdown cause I really wanted an egg salad sandwich. I was originally hesitant because I thought the menu was quite pricey, especially in the SGV. However, the crave was too desperate and I tried their egg salad sandwich and it was SO good! The ingredients felt really high quality, even down to the brioche bun. Not only did it taste delicious but the portions were quite generous, so generous that the egg salad was dripping off the bun. The only thing is I wish they melted the cheese. The sandwich came with half salad and half potatoes. I usually don't like potatoes but they made it super crispy and slightly seasoned. The salad was also really good with a light dressing that felt healthy.I appreciated their takeout packaging. It was eco friendly and the sauces/dressing were packaged separately. There were also no utensils, which I was grateful for! Eco friendly!!Parking was a little annoying since it's mostly street parking on downtown main street. It's not busy right now due to lockdown but I suspect it would be terrible when dine in starts again. I would definitely love to come back when dine in is allowed.",0.9909

In my opinion it was a great spot for like a date. It gives out a romantic vibe because they serve everyone water through a wine bottle. Although it is a bit pricey, i personally think its worth it. Also, its located in Main street which is a great spot wince theres mini shops, boba, movies...etc. So after you're done eating, you can like have a walk down main street or just chill out. The only down side to this place is the parking because if all the spots are taken in front of the restaurant, then you have to park far away.",0.9758
16-Apr-20,"This place is a really nice hole-in-the-wall. My friends and I were looking into a brunch place and decided to try this one out since it was nearby. Since it's on Main Street, it's mainly street parking, but usually street parking isn't too hard to find. The decor inside is so chic and really trendy. The staff was super friendly as well. We all ordered different types of Benedicts, and we all really liked the Benedicts we ordered! The Norwegian Benedict is kind of pricey but it's really good! There's generous portions of both potatoes and salad. The tables are kind of small but it wasn't a huge issue for us. I also tried the hazelnut coffee, which was not bad. I could definitely taste the hazelnut. I don't think I would get it again just because it was pretty ordinary. Overall, great breakfast/brunch place with great vibes.",0.9947

3-Apr-20,A friend brought me here when I was visiting LA and it's really neat for brunch. They have a variety of Benedict and they make a very classic one. One order was really filling and it would be enough to just share even one savory and one sweet menu site to have variety.,0.8932
28-Mar-20,"One of my favorite part about this meal was the side of potatoes. They were so crispy, wasn't overly seasoned, and came with a generous portion as well.I also really enjoyed their take on the french toast. The outside had a nice coating which made it crunchier than typical french toast. The inside however was just as fluffy and soft. Best of all, it wasn't too sweet! Even then, me and my friend couldn't finish a full portion, so I do recommend the half portion size.The BBQ pulled pork benedict was a little too sweet for my liking. The sauce was overwhelming and really masked the other parts of the dish. If you do like benedicts, I would suggest getting the Norwegian one which has smoked salmon and is a lot lighter!",0.9741
22-Mar-20,"As a fan of eggs benedict, it was a given I had to give this spot a try. I had the soft shell crab Benedict, which was pretty good. The batter of the soft shell crab had a little less crunch than I would've liked, but it was decent. I probably should have gone for the most popular item, or the original eggs Benedict, but maybe next time. The side of house fries were delicious and super filling. I was so glad we could do a half order of the French toast, since I always want to try French toast at breakfast places but never only want the sweet option. The bread was crunchy with a little chew (in a good way) and doused in a generous amount of syrup, giving it an overall great mouthfeel. Maybe I'll return one day to give their regular eggs Benedict another try...",0.9949
12-Mar-20,"Came here with one of my girlfriends for brunch. The food was cool. I ordered the omelette with salmon. I didn't realize that the salad came with corn, so I sent it back. When they brought my plate back to me my omelette was lukewarm. Well, at that point I didn't want to send it back again because I was hungry and my girlfriend already had both her omelette and French toast. My girlfriend had I believe the California Omelette (I could be wrong about the name). She enjoyed both her omelette and French toast. I probably would babe really enjoyed mine had it been hot. I will definitely give this place one more try and see how it goes.",0.8548

10-Mar-20,"I visited Popping yolk in a Monday morning - it wasn't as packed as people have mentioned although there was a good amount of foot traffic so that was a good sign.  I wasn't expecting to order at the counter, but it actually worked out well cause I was having a breakfast date with an old friend  and I figured this meant less interruptions so we could just gab away while we ate and just walk out when we were done without having to wait for a bill so I was ok with the whole order first situation and they still checked up on us quite often so we weren't  just forgotten about after we ordered. The food came out really quick after our order had been placed so that was awesome cause it still tasted really fresh.  I enjoyed my soft shell crab benedict it was unlike anything at other breakfast places.   And the orders are huge!!!  I couldn't finish it all.  The French Toast  was crunchy as you'd expect for a cereal crusted toast and not too sweet which I liked. Overall I had a great breakfast experience.",0.99

You order at the counter and they bring out and serve the food when it's ready.I ordered the arugula breakfast egg sandwich and added avocado. It was served fairly quickly, and it came with salad and country potatoes. The plating was pretty and picture perfect. And the food was pretty good too. Total was about $13.The second time I came, I ordered the avocado and ham egg sandwich (which comes on a croissant), minus the ham and I asked for scrambled eggs instead. It was so good! I also got a glass of their lychee white sangria, which was awesome! My one complaint though would be that it felt like there was more ice than sangria in my glass **********************My Ratings: 1 Star: Terrible; just thinking about it makes me angry. 2 Stars: Wasn't a fan so Not likely to return. 3 Stars: Meh.

3-Mar-20,"I came here recently for the 2nd time with my daughter. When this place first opened things seemed a bit unorganized. This time around, the service is much better and their business operation seem to run much smoother. I ordered the following:1) Popcorn chicken. This was surprisingly good! The batter was light and crispy. I think I also tasted a bit of basil, but I didn't see any. Either way, it was good!2) Smoked Salmon Benedict. My favorite! I ate the whole thing! Haha.3) Toffee Banana Toast. My kid ate just half a slice. She seemed to like it. I didn't try it, but I saw several tables order this, so I would think it's tasty.4) Hazelnut coffee with almond milk. Super good! I really enjoy the breakfast and brunch here. I typically go down to Newport Beach/Laguna Beach for this type of food so I am glad to see a place like this in the Alhambra/Monterey Park area. Also, service was excellent. Two servers came by to check on me several times. A side note, you order at the front counter and the hostess takes you to a table. If you want to order more items from the menu, flag a server down. They will be happy to assist.",0.9936
3-Mar-20,"The presentation of the restaurant nice, food was good, but, a big BUT the coffee was terrible and over priced for the shock I got, I asked for a latte no foam ( I do not like the foam in my coffee).  They brought me the strongest black coffee in a drinking glass not a cup in a drinking glass! I asked the young waitress for a latte, she said since I didn't want the foam which is the milk the coffe is black! What?  Does that make any sense?  Starbucks or Antigua Cafe will give me a latte coffee with the milk still in the coffee with NO FOAM.  I paid $4.50 for a black latte in a glass.  Do Not get their coffe there.  Even my husband couldn't drink his regular coffee because it was too too strong.  Whoever the owner is, got to improve in your customer satisfaction and warn your first time customers your coffee is different (comes in a glass) and it's very very strong.  All together I spent 9.00 in coffe we couldn't drink",0.8124
2-Mar-20,"Had so many high expectations... but man. Honestly a bit of a let down. We came in at 11:30am, and the restaurant was mostly empty(30% full). Our food came out very quickly, but perhaps a little too quickly, because my Norwegian Benedict came out cold! The sauce was already congealing. Could it be that they just served me whatever food was already sitting there on the counter? The chilled smoked salmon only made my eggs colder, haha. A little bit sad. Also, even though the menu said that my eggs came with spring mix and potatoes, my plate ended up just being half eggs, half fried potatoes. Was it because they ran out of spring mix...? Not sure.My friend's smoked salmon omelette was good (and actually hot too!), but she said that she got random patches of salt in it. Both of us were not very impressed by the smoked salmon. It was rather chewy and difficult to cut. Not your ideal melt-in-your-mouth smoked salmon at all.On the other hand, my friend's Strawberry cheese cake crepe was delicious and very sweet. There was cereal in it, which created a nice texture. The huge portions of potatoes was also a highlight- they were very crunchy and tasty, albeit very oily. One of my friends complained that when she ate her potatoes, oil came out when she poked it with her fork.Overall, this restaurant was pleasing to the eye, kind of pleasing to the tastebuds, but definitely not pleasing to neither my health nor temperature receptors, lol. I hope that if I were to come at a more popular time, there wouldn't be these issues.",0.9939
1-Mar-20,"Well, it's rare for me to write a review the same day I visit a restaurant but I just couldn't wait. I'm a fan! Restaurant: Quaint. Seats about 50 - 75 people. Charming. You place your order then find a seat. One woman found a seat prior to her friend placing an order and was asked to get up. HA! I love that. While I understand why the woman did it, I also understand why Popping Yolk didn't allow it. We found parking in the front. I am unsure if there is parking in the back. Utensils are on each table inside a mason jar/vase with napkins. Food: My sistah-friend had the salmon omelet with salad on the side. She is persnickety when it comes to food so if she did not like it, she would not have eaten it. An empty plate from her is a good sign for the restaurant. I had to try the toffee banana french toast but I also added the California omelet. I was skeptical about the toffee because I wasn't sure how it was displayed. However, YAY! Great choice. It's sweet, so be forewarned. It's also SO good AND the french toast is deep-fried. ADDED PLUS! The CA omelet needed cheese to ensure the spinach, mushrooms, avocado, and egg held together. At the same time, it was still quite delish. I will definitely be returning as I saw three other items I must try. Service: You walk in, place your order, pay for your order, are given a number, then you find a seat. The cashier was pleasant. The waitstaff was attentive and courteous. I'm happy we chose this place. Satisfied customer indeed!",0.9961
1-Mar-20,"Don't know where to start this, so many good things to talk about! 1.) Great food and drinks- ordered kimchi spam omelette and mango green tea, both were so good! The omelette was soooo soft and juicy, perfect match with kimchi and omg my favorite spam!2.) Environment- super decent place and the decor was so cute! Lighting is also a plus if you want to take photos and post on your IG/Facebook 3.) Service- friendly+++ and they refill my drinks without even asking, what wonderful experience!Highly recommend!",0.985
1-Mar-20,"3 stars for the cuteness of this cafe and decor. Service was great, cashier and server were friendly and polite. However, the food left much to the imagination. I ordered the pesto omelette and since I'm on a ""diet"" skipped the potatoes and stuck with the salad. The salad was your basic salad, nothing fancy but the dressing that was on the table was pretty good (a vinaigrette I believe). The omelette came with spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and topped with pesto. Sounds yummy right? Well it lacked something, idk if the veggies needed salt or seasoning but the pesto did nothing for the omelette and you can't mess up an omelette! It was so blah that I ate it because for the three of us today, our meals came out to $61 and I felt bad that my husband paid so much for a mediocre breakfast meal. He said his eggs Benedict tasted fishy and I swear that the veggies in my omelette tasted like they had been cooked in with something else, almost as if they had been precooked and just thrown into the omelette. My stepdaughter's waffles were tooooo sweet and dry, like not your typical waffle but a churro in the shape of a waffle. Kids like sugar right? Not in her case as she said the waffles were coated with grainy sugar. Also my americano and my husbands iced coffee was super watery. Which should have been a sign of the food because of you can't get coffee right, then everything else will be just as bad. Sadly, I would not return,",0.9793
27-Feb-20,"Stopped by for Sunday brunch with friends. It's a small spot on Main, but it kept busy the entire time I was there. I think that brunch menus are basically the same no matter where you go, but I was pleasantly surprised at their variety. It's a fast casual restaurant: order and pay at the register, grab your number, find a seat, and they'll bring your food to you. Might want to look up the menu before you go. There were a few groups clogging up the lobby because we all didn't know what to order yet. Keep in mind that they seem to switch up their menu though. Looks like even yelp pics have a hard time keeping up. Between the 4 of us, we ordered a Benedict, a sandwich, and 2 burgers. No one had any complaints. I personally really, really liked the cowboy burger. I winced at the prices, but it's actually not that bad. I definitely walked away stuffed for less than $15. Since they're constantly switching up the menu with interesting ideas, I'll probably be back eventually.",0.9245
26-Feb-20,"Came here on a Wednesday afternoon for brunch. It wasn't too busy and we were able to place our orders and were seated right away (you order at the front counter and pay first). The food were all tasty. The people who work here were great, they checked on us often and answered any questions we had. Food was brought out quickly as well.",0.7003
24-Feb-20,"Came to try this place out and it wasn't bad. There was still plenty of seating when my husband and I came at about 9am. The girl at the cashier was friendly, service was pretty good. The smoked salmon omelet I ordered was really big and pretty decent. The toffee banana French toast was also pretty good. It's deep fried so it's very crunchy...I did wish I could feel the texture of the bread a little more rather than all crunch. My biggest complaint is their water glasses....both mine and my husband's glasses of water smelled like dirty wet towel so it grossed us out and neither of us could drink out of the glass. Other than that not too bad of a place.",0.9719
24-Feb-20,"This review is based on service, quality, and cleanliness: Service: you order at a register and then the host will seat you. The hostess the day we went was super nice and friendly. Even though it was busy she still took the time with each person going over recommendations and what are top picks people usually enjoy trying. Really enjoyed her. As far as food, it came out surprisingly fast for how busy it was on a Saturday afternoon!Quality: the dishes we got were:- Ice hazelnut Latte: this drink was super good and not too strong! Highly recommend it!-toffee waffles: this is served wit bananas and a toffee syrup! Really good, but very sweet if you are into that- kimchi and spam omelette: this was super good, but I highly recommend reducing the amount of kimchi that is put into the omelette. It was over filled with kimchi and then only 4 pieces of spam. If the amount of kimchi is reduced the omelette would be soo much better!- crunchy french toast: first time having this and I must say it is freaking amazing!! Share a small order with people because its pretty heavy!Cleanliness: restaurant is very clean and appealing to the eyes. Tables are cleaned very quickly and the bar area looks amazing.Overall: very good brunch spot wit a huge selection of food options. The decor and atmosphere is amazing and feels really nice to be in there. Highly recommend for brunch!!",0.9962
23-Feb-20,"I've been here twice so far. You order and pay at the counter/register and then you grab a seat. You'll have to wait for a table to open up if they're all full, but the staff is helpful in getting you settled in a table. Florentine Benedict - Hollandaise sauce was bland. Everything else was cooked nicely and the country fried potatoes had a good crisp.California Omelette - This was huge! Good amounts of avocado, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and spinach. Salad was refreshing too. Croissant Smoked Salmon Sandwich - Egg was cooked perfectly sunny side up and the smoked salmon was good. This was also a big sandwich. Toffee Banana French Toast - Loved how crunchy the toast was! Good texture and wasn't super sweet. Didn't taste much of the toffee though. Overall, it's a good choice for brunch in the area. You get your bang for your buck here with their portion sizes and I am a fan of their potatoes.",0.992
22-Feb-20,"Popping Yolk Cafe is a few doors down from Starbucks, painted the color of an egg yolk, you can't miss it. Free parking all along the streets.My husband and I came by this brunch eatery on a Sunday, around 1:20 pm. If this is your first time dining here, you order your food first and then sit yourself down. There was a line when we arrived. My husband ended up siting at a small table that seats 2 while I waited in line to order. I ended up getting:Osmanthus Oolong Tea, $5 prior to tax- I thought the taste of this tea was nice and perfect for a cold day. Just didn't like that the tea bag is in the teapot, as the end of the tea is bitter.White Peach Tea, $5 prior to tax- Great flavor with the exception of the tea at the end of the tea pot. Since the tea bag is in the tea pot, it is rather bitter. Would recommend removing the tea bag after steeping so you can avoid that.  Half Order Of Toffee Banana French Toast, $6 prior to tax- Since I had tried Popping Yolk Cafe's location in Hacienda Heights before (which has covered dog friendly outdoor seating by the way, unfortunately this location does not have that) and had the house french toast, I decided to try this flavor. Because the french toast is deep fried, it does add a crunch and also makes for a heavy meal. I thought this was pretty sweet and felt there was no need for syrup. I did like the sliced bananas and appreciated that the whipped cream was on the side and not on top. Soft Shell Crab Burger, $16 prior to tax- A decadent meal, this burger comes with an angus beef patty that is topped with a breaded and fried soft shell crab, slice of cheese and sunny side egg, all on a brioche bun. The crab might be a little too ""crabby"", as my husband would describe, but we both like eating crab so it doesn't bother us. Everything was cooked perfectly. This meal comes with a side of a mixed green salad and a side of fried potatoes. My husband ate all of his salad and the burger but was pretty full for the next few hours. This could easily be made into 2 meals or shared with another person. Soft Shell Crab Benedict, $16 prior to tax- I oped for the benedict version of the soft shell crab, which is served on top of a toasted muffin, a poached egg placed on top of the breaded crab and a hefty dose of hollandaise sauce. Pretty rich, I only had one of the 2 eggs Benedict. This plate is also served with a green salad and fried potatoes. I thought the salad was great and fresh but would probably ask for the dressing on the side (there is actually a bottle of salad dressing on the table for those that want more). I also really liked the potato and thought the portion was rather generous. -------------------------------(Total= $52.56 after tax, prior to tip)Service was minimal but easy to find an employee if we needed anything. Wait time for food was a little under 20 minutes, which was understandable since everything is made fresh to order.  Overall, had a good dining experience and would recommend Popping Yolk Cafe to those looking for a great brunch place.",0.9971

20-Feb-20,"Went here on a Wednesday afternoon and was not disappointed. Food was delicious, they have a good range of food to choose from, the decor is cute, and the service was pretty good too. Portions are also quite large- so to me it seemed well worth the price.",0.965
18-Feb-20,"Came here for a Valentine's Day brunch around 1:30pm! It wasn't super crowded and we were seated right away! Super cute interior and chill vibes!So how it goes is that you order and pay on the counter first and then you can have a seat after! Which I think is pretty efficient so that you don't have to flag waitresses or wait for them to come to you! The service was also great and the severs were super nice! Their Crunchy Toffee Banana French Toast and House French Toast are a MUST!! So crispy, and soft! It's definitely not too sweet either and i love that the fruits gives it a refreshing taste so you dont feel so heavy after eating it! For entr√©e we got BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict, it came with salad and potatoes. It was delicious and the portions are pretty good! The pulled pork and  egg had a lot of flavor ! Add some hot sauce if you like spicy food! The second entr√©e was the Egg Salad Sandwich, it was okay. It came with potatoes and salad and it was in between brioche buns. I just wish that they had toasted the bun more and melted the cheese with it! I'd definitely like it more! Which is why i gave 4 stars not 5. Wish I can give a 4.5 though. Definitely recommend the Mango Iced tea! It was so delish and it's refillable wish I could take it to go! L",0.9925
17-Feb-20,"First time at the Alhambra location. I absolutely love it! This location is very big, nicely decorated and has an awesome bar. In addition, the food tasted super delicious as always. They recently added soft shelled crab eggs Benedict and smoked salmon omelette. It did not disappoint. They tasted delicious!!! The eggs were very poppable. They came with a side of potatoes and salad. They also have unique drinks to complement their entrees. We ordered the horchata latte and the green tea latter both which tasted super delicious. And as always I can't get enough of their French toast if you've never tried, you definitely should stop by!",0.9857

I really love the freshly squeezed OJ!  Great food, great service!",0.9855
15-Feb-20,"I had high expectations for this place, maybe too high. We ordered the kimchi omelette, banana toffee French toast, soft shell crab burger and ham and avocado croissant sandwich with a mango ice tea. The French toast tasted very similar to the ones from Burger King. The soft shell crab was good and the croissant sandwich was decent. The mango ice tea was very good and another star was the salad dressing, it had a hint of yuzu. The biggest disappointment was the kimchi omelette, it was a mess. Do not order this.",0.0
15-Feb-20,"I was craving breakfast and this place had some good options to choose from. The popcorn chicken was good but it was missing some seasoning. The house french toast was thick and it was delicious. I ordered the half order french toast and I couldn't finish it. I would recommend the Norweign Benedict because the smoked salmon gave it a good flavor, the bread was not dry and the egg was good too. Parking is available nearby and on the street. The waitress and servers were sweet and approachable. I would come here again.",0.9686

Definitely my type of an old classic breakfast plate!*toffee banana crunchy French toast- loved this! Has a great crunch and the perfect sweetness level! *orange juice- freshly squeezed!

15-Feb-20,They have awesome breakfast selection. This time I wanted to try their burger.I ordered mozzarella sticks as my appetizer. OMG! So cheesy!! Check out my video of the cheese pull~ The batter is not too thick so every bite is full of yummy cheese. I tried the Hawaiian Burger. The plating/visual is nice. I love the buns toasted on the grill. The meat is cooked perfectly. It goes so well with the pineapple and the sweet glaze on the buns. I had onion rings on the side. Super crispy!!! Great lunch indeed~Their staffs are very attentive as always. The service is definitely A+!,0.9893
14-Feb-20,"Came here for brunch on a typical Sunday mid-morning. When you first enter, you order at the counter, then you grab a table, and the food comes out to you. The portion is pretty good and the taste and the quality of the food is pretty great as well. It does get packed here, so seating may be hard to find, even though there are quite a few tables in the room. Parking is done in the parking structure in the next block and the walk is pretty cute. You'll walk by the hustle and bustle of Main Street, Alhambra. Go pop yolks at Popping Yolk Cafe! (Disclaimer: Yolks not included on all dishes.)",0.9565
14-Feb-20,"Checked out Popping Yolk again for their delicious brunch menu items. This time the Soft Shell Crab Benedict caught my eye. The plate of food was massive with 2 of the Benedicts, a mound of Country Fried Potatoes, and a fresh Garden Spring Mix Salad. Perfectly poached eggs with that runny yolk as you slice into it and the soft shell crab had a wonderful crunchy crust with the tender crab. Outstanding! I also ordered a half order of the Toffee Banana French Toast and it was amazing also. I love the crispy outer crust of their French toast. You can't go wrong with this or the House French Toast. And I washed it down with their signature Mango Iced Green Tea, which has unlimited refills so definitely get that to drink. Another fantastic meal here. I'd go to Popping Yolk more often if it was closer to me!",0.9892
14-Feb-20,"Love Love Love Popping Yolk Cafe! We've always been to Hacienda Heights location and we fell in love! So we decided to check out the Alhambra location and we were so glad we did! This place is pretty big and high ceiling which I love! The vibe is perfect for the brunch spot! Parking was easy because there is free parking structure right next to the restaurant (not too far). So we ordered Smoked Salmon Omelette and Soft Shell crab Egg Benedicts. They were both so delightful. They both came with a side of salad and their potatoes which are super delicious and big portions! Smoked Salmon Omelette was big and it was delicious. Soft Shell Crab egg benedict was also delicious and it didn't taste ""fishy"" at all. It was such a good combo because egg benedict had poached egg that was perfect so it was perfect combo. We also got their horchata latte & matcha green tea latte. they were both rich and deep and good combo with the food we ordered. Overall, the service was good and we had such a great time! definitely recommend if you are looking for brunch place in Alhambra!",0.9982
13-Feb-20,"Y'all on a brunch-athon? Cause I am! I highly recommend this place for your brunch needs, especially for those who want a mix of breakfast goods and sweetness! They serve a selection of egg Benedict, toast, sandwich, burgers and crepes! This time I had the opportunity to try their crepes, and I was taken a back at how sweet their crepes are. I expected it to be sweet like Japanese crepes, but they were wayyy to sweet for me. I didn't even finish the dish, and had to share with my sweet tooth companion. I got the Strawberry Cheesecake Crepe, so it had cereal in it. The cereal it had was cornflakes which made the crepe sweet and crunchy. I recommend this dish for sweet tooth folks, but if you don't like sweets-- AVOID the crepes section! Wish they had a wider selection of crepes that were breakfast, veggie or keto themed. As for the Toffee Banana Crunchy French Toast, the portion was good and it was delicious. It wasn't as sweet as the crepe I got, and it left a good impression. I really like the way they deep fried their toast since it taste unique. Highly recommend this dish if you come with a friend. Lastly, the Kimichi Spam Omelette! It deserves a 10/10! I love Korean kimichi, spam and egg as a combo so this turned out to be a masterpiece in my eyes. It was so good and left me craving more. I recommend this unique dish if you looking to go out of your usual egg omelette. Overall, the vibe for this place is amazing. This place is also order first and self seated so it might be difficult to find seats. Parking Garage is free and is located on First Street.",0.9984

10-Feb-20,"Grabbed brunch here on Sunday, and let me tell you right away which item you need to order immediately when you get in - their house french toast! Holy moly, we ordered 2 entrees and left the french toast last since it was a sweet item. By the time we got to the french toast, I was expecting it to be soggy, but NOPE! It was super crunchy, tasty, and man, I could go back there and order another one right now! lol!Ok. So they're located in Pasadena. We were lucky and found 2 hour parking around the corner from the restaurant. The restaurant was really busy, but as soon as one of the servers saw us, they greeted us immediately and took our order. We got the normandie eggs benedict and the california omelette. Also 2 OJs, and half an order of their house french toast, which I talked about in the beginning. Honestly, the food here is great, staff is super friendly, and customer service is superb. Just make sure you order that french toast I keep talking about and we be good",0.9826
10-Feb-20,"I love brunch and Popping Yolk Cafe hit the spot for me. I visited on a late Sunday afternoon. It's late lunch at that point but still, brunch food is good ALL the time. The cafe was relatively busy but still plenty of spots for people to sit.You order when you walk in and receive a number that you bring with you to your chosen table. There are some half booths, high tables, bigger tables, and bar seating. Our drinks came out first and our food wasn't too far behind that.I enjoyed both the jasmine green tea latte and the horchata latte we got. Their lattes are creamy with just the right amount of flavor. They also come in cute glass cups! Water comes in a hexagonal cup, which I thought was pretty cool.As for the food- BOMB! Everything surpassed my expectations for an average brunch. We got the BBQ Pulled Pork Eggs Benedict, Popping Yolk Burger, and a half order of toffee banana french toast. The BBQ Pulled Pork benedict has a very strong sweet bbq flavor. The burger was super juicy and cooked just right. I especially enjoyed their potatoes which were crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside. The salad was a surprise because although it didn't seem like it had a lot of dressing, the yuzu flavor was everywhere! The tartness of the dressing was refreshing and went well with our savory entrees. There's more salad dressing on the table if you wish to add more dressing too!Overall, I had a satisfying brunch at Popping Yolk. I do wish there could be more natural lighting to get that brunch feel but it somewhat feels like a bar. The decor is already cute, but with a bit more, it'll be the perfect instagrammy brunch spot.",0.9962
9-Feb-20,"Really yummy brunch spot! The menu has an impressive selection of Benedicts, omelets, sandwiches/burgers, and crepes, but it lacks some more interesting healthy options like grain bowls. This is definitely a place to indulge.My friend and I each got a Benedict (avocado and crab) and matcha lattes, and we split a half order of the crispy French toast. My almond milk matcha latte was super good: heavy on the matcha and not too sweet, just how I like it. (5/5)The avocado Benedict with ham was very solid, and I loved the crispy potatoes (Pro tip: make a dipping sauce with ketchup and hot sauce, provided on the table). My one critique - the Hollandaise needed a bit more lemon or some other flavor to add a punch to the dish. (4/5)The crispy French toast reminds me of the one Blu Jam is famous for, with the extra crispy outside and soft inside. Super rich, and maybe a bit too deep fried. The berries added a much-needed freshness, but it could also use a bit more syrup and maybe some fresh mint. The half size is pretty large + perfect to share. (4/5)The service was fast and friendly, so no complaints there! Overall, really solid brunch food with huge portions that will leave you STUFFED.",0.9971
3-Feb-20,"I went here on a Saturday mid morning to have brunch with my gal pals. It was pretty busy, but we were seated right away & service was excellent. This cafe is obviously where you'd go to get your egg fix- with so many selections.I really wanted to like this cafe, but I thought my order of the smoked salmon croissant was lacking flavor. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that I'd want to eat again or crave.I ordered my croissant with a simple side salad which I did enjoy. I also got to taste their side of potatoes which wasn't bad but, just plain.The ambiance is on the grey scale and wood vibe. 5 stars for being aesthetic and clean. I also liked how this cafe requires you to order before being seated and their menu is displayed on flat screen TVs. Overall, this place was okay. Again, it's not something I'd make as my go-to, but I would come again to try a different order and see how that goes!",0.9875

30-Jan-20,"We were happy to see a new brunch place pop up in downtown Alhambra.  Nothing like a good late morning meal after a morning workout.  We've been here a couple times after a jog round the Rose Bowl.  The food here, particularly at this price point, is average at best.  The French toast, which comes out crunchy and sweet was the best thing we had.  Both the house and toffee banana were pretty good.  The eggs Benedict was also solid.  The savory hollandaise sauce and runny poached egg were well executed.  Unfortunately the burgers and sandwiches were just plain bad.  The truffle burger came out dry and lacked flavor.  Same goes for the bacon egg breakfast sandwich.   I'd happily take a sausage egg McMuffin over the breakfast sandwiches here.  The service was fast and attentive but the food unfortunately did not impress, at least not enough to stand out from other brunch options in the area.",0.1729
29-Jan-20,"I was excited when a new brunch spot opened in Alhambra because I thought that was exactly what Main Street was missing. However, after visiting, I was slightly disappointed. As you enter the restaurant, you'll first order at the counter and then wait for a table. We ordered the Norwegian Benedict, House French Toast, Banana toffee French Toast. As I was cutting through the benedict, I noticed that it was moist and watery. The English muffin at the bottom was a bit soggy. My guess is that the poached egg was not rested enough before it was placed on the plate. The potatoes were the most disappointing. They tasted as if they were from frozen pre-bought packages, and looked like cut up frozen French fries. The House french toast and banana toffee french toast were both very similar in taste, with the exception of the fruit. I thought their French toast was over battered and too deep fried. They tasted more like deep fried dough you would find at carnivals than french toast. Service was good. However, I do have to point out that a few forks and knives from the utensil container in the middle of the table were not washed clean and still had bits of food on them. Overall, it was a subpar experience. Their portions are large, but dishes were lacking in quality.",-0.2568

I had much higher expections for the toffee banana French toast. Next time we will probably explore something else on the menu. The space itself is simple and casual, perfect for catching up with friends over a meal.",0.9371

It comes with a side of salad or roasted potatoes. The roasted potatoes are fried pretty well. It was a good ratio of potato and the fried outer layer.

I hear the mimosas are good but the place is rather small so i wouldn't say bring your big  group for brunch here. Other than that, it's a good place to  eat.",0.9208
23-Jan-20,It's been awhile since I'm back to this place.Service still 5 starsEgg Benedict still super delicious,0.8225
2-Jan-20,"Order first at the counter before getting seated! Met up with Donna S. for some Sunday brunch at 11 am. The place was already packed and there was a line at the counter to place dine-in and to-go orders. After placing our order, we were assigned two seats at the bar counter. Note that there are no purse hooks there and that bar seating consists of stools, so don't bring a lot of stuff to carry, as the only place to put it would be on the metal bars to support your feet.We decided to split two breakfast items and they came out pretty promptly. We got the Popping Yolk Breakfast with the eggs scrambled ($12) and the BBQ Pulled Pork Benedict with the side of country fried potatoes ($13.50). Not sure if it's intended this way or if it came from the salad, but the sausage in the Popping Yolk Breakfast was sweet, sort of like candied bacon/maple syrup. Despite splitting the two items, we got full entirely off of the eggs benedict and I took home the other to enjoy later. My favorite of the two was definitely the pulled pork benedict! They also serve a version with soft shell crab and a omelette dish with kimchi spam that I want to try on my next visit.Service was quick and they made sure to check if we needed anything, even when we were sitting at the bar.I was worried about parking in Alhambra, but there are several free parking structures around the area to leave your car.",0.9621
2-Jan-20,"Cute brunch place but our order was wrong , easy  over eggs were realllly easy, meaning there were whites that weren't cooked.  Yuk.  Plus no halfnhalf for coffee?  Portions were big. The banana french toast was the best dish. Crunchy and not overwhelmingly sweet.",0.7836
2-Jan-20,"Came on New Years day after the Rose Parade and really enjoyed my experience. Not too pricey, good food, no wait when I went (11AM) but there was a line shortly after we arrived. I have the pulled pork omelette and it was good but honestly tasted more like BBQ sauce than anything, not bad but not that interested. Will try the kimchi and spam next time to see how that one is. Parking is available free in the garage across the street, if you go to Downtown Alhambra often you know the spot. I don't love the style of restaurant where you order at a register first, just not my favorite style of service but it was fine. I would suggest Popping Yolk, especially since Alhambra has a real need for nice brunch spots.",0.6994
1-Jan-20,"Slightly lower cost than other breakfast/brunch places of this quality and caliber.  We came at around 9 AM on New Year's day and we ordered and got our food in a timely manner. At around 9:45 AM, the cafe started getting fisted with people, so make sure you time your visit correctly!You order first, pay, get seated and eat! It does cut down the time waiting to get your check and the awkwardness of flagging people down, etc. The person who was helping us at the counter was speaking to us super fast and was accidentally cutting off what we were saying, but I guess it's the breakfast jitters because when she checked up on us later, everything was chill.We got the:1) Half Order of Banana Toffee French Toast:-A half order comes with 3 sizable pieces and it's enough to fill my stomach!-VERY UNIQUE French toast. The entire thing is deep fried, so it's very crispy and crunchy!-I had to ask for an extra side of syrup, but I'm the type of person to drown all my foods in sauce. -It comes with a lot of banana slices as well.2) Norwegian Eggs Benedict with a side of salad:-I sampled a bit of my friend's dish and thought it was pretty good. -Hollandaise sauce wasn't too lemon-y sour or runny and the eggs had the perfect runny texture. -My friend had one complaint that the lox salmon was too salty for his tastes and in comparison to similar eggs benedicts with the same topping (I couldn't tell because I just took huge bits of my sweet French toast lmao). -The salad was aight. Fresh veggies, light vinaigrette. Solid place to get some breakfast.",0.9749
31-Dec-19,"This is a cute and new spot for brunch in Alhambra. Usually I would have to travel to Pasadena for a similar brunch spot like this one. The food here is decent. I like that many of their entrees come with either a salad or their hash browns. Speaking of their hash browns, it is amazing! I would say the highlight of the meal from one potato lover to another. I also enjoyed their soft shell crab benedict and their French Toast was so decadent and delicious! Portion sizes were pretty big. Make sure you order first before finding a table to sit at. There's plenty of nearby parking structures to park at.",0.9839
31-Dec-19,"I love their classic benedict! Ive tried their new item, soft shell crab benedict, but cant beat the classic. Its a big portion, but makes you feel a bit healthy. It is an order first service, but the service is average.",0.7537
30-Dec-19,"A cute, new spot in downtown Alhambra - The interior decor has very hipster vibes and they serve great breakfast selections.I came here on a Sunday morning with my boyfriend and his mom at around 10AM - It was not super crowded and had plenty of seating. The process is that you order when you arrive, take a number, find a seat and they'll bring the food to you. Efficient and quick!Everything came out quickly and tasted great! I got the Egg & Cheese Breakfast Sandwich, I was so hungry that I forgot to take a picture of it. It came on a brioche bun which I think is a major game changer! It's not oily or dry, and it has a perfect texture. I'm a slut for a brioche bun...Parking is easy - There's a lot right by the cafe with 4-hour free parking and multiple levels with spots. Easy peasy!",0.9695
29-Dec-19,So many new restaurants are opening up in this area! It's not amazing but it definitely beats going to a Denny's or the retro diner down the street. Their creme br√ªl√©e french toast is pretty good! It's almost as good at Blu Jam Cafe's french toast option. I definitely recommend getting a benedict with the homestyle potatoes.,0.9716
28-Dec-19,"Overall: Tired of a boring old breakfast? Denny's and iHop just not cutting it? Well look no further, popping yolk is the place to be! Background: Main Street in Alhambra has changed so much over the years and is no stranger to having business come and go, so I'm always wary about trying a place out. But this place stood the test of time because even after all the ""hype"" had died down and the summer ended, I noticed it still remained busy. Decided it would be a good place for my friend and I to catch up and I gotta say, I was surprised! I have always had to drive to either Pasadena or parts of LA for good brunch, but it's safe to say, I won't have to anymore! My review is as follows: Food: 5/5 Love the portion sizes. I saw a lot of people ordering sandwiches off the menu but I knew I wanted to try the Egg Benedict's. I ordered the Norwegian one and my friend ordered the soft shell crab(how cool is that?!) and it was really tasty! The egg was poached just right and I enjoyed the taste. It wasn't too salty or light. Another thing to note is that the portion size of the potatoes is large. They give you soooo much, but for a potato enthusiast like myself, I found it too be just right. Always better to have more than less I always say. Price: 5/5Decently priced! Each plate is roughly around $12-16 which is standard for a good brunch! I would say it's well worth it. Service: 5/5There isn't necessarily a server here, but all of my interactions with the employees were pleasant. How it works? You order at the front, they give you a number and then you find a table. They'll then bring you your meal and water. Food came out really quick despite me coming on a busy Saturday morning, so that was much appreciated.Ambiance: 5/5Loved the interior! There were leaf wallpapers all over and the place had an urban touch to it. Very hipster! FYI: tables inside are quite small and I noticed bigger parties had to wait a bit longer because the employees had to wait for tables to put together, big parties of 2-4 were ideal! Parking: There's a parking structure in the back(adjacent to the Starbucks) that's free for 4 hours! All plenty of street parking if needed.",0.9974
27-Dec-19,"Come here hungry because they give generous portions.  You order at the front counter and grab a seat as they deliver your meal to you.  The avocado eggs Benedict and the croissant sandwich was delicious.  The potatoes are good, though they give too much so don't eat that first or you'll be full.  The restaurant is clean and spacious.  The restrooms are well maintained.",0.9287
27-Dec-19,"So far the best brunch place Ive been to around my area. The only thing I hate is they operate like a fast food chain.You enter then you order and pay in the counter before you get seated, its not something you expect in a brunch place. Personally, I don't like it and it prevents people from ordering more.Let's talk about the food, the egg Benedict is perfection, you can order it with a side of salad or potatoes. The best item that Ive tried is their French Toast, its crispy and so soft inside. Definitely always thinking about the french toast after Ive tried it.",0.9501
22-Dec-19,One and done. The food was ok and overpriced compared to other cafes serving similar items. The service here sucked. I went in on a Tuesday morning about 11 AM and it wasn't busy. The server brought my boyfriend his food and we waited 5 mins thinking mine would follow but it didn't. The server came 3 more times with the wrong order. She had no idea where the food belonged. Waited another 15 mins no food. By this time my boyfriend was done with his food. We sat their waiting and waiting another 5-10 mins and even considered walking out. I ordered a full stack of toffee French toast and it was definitely not worth the wait. They tasted like greasy funnel cakes. I could hardly finish 2 slices out of 6. I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs and they were not scrambled and still runny. I sent it back and just got a burned egg. Paid $5.50 for a glass of orange juice. I don't remember seeing that price on the menu board.,-0.6368
21-Dec-19,"I love this place & I'm not an easy critic when it comes to breakfast food. Everything we had was amazing. They have the best little potatoes that come on the side. I had the ""pulled pork eggs benedict"", which were awesome. Orange juice was fresh squeezed. Can't wait to come back.",0.9584
21-Dec-19,"Popping Yolk is little past Starbucks and Coldstone and is the bright yellow building. You line up to order and then you are given a number and a table. The menu has a good enough variety of Benedicts, omelettes, sandwiches, salads, and burgers, but it isn't overwhelming.I ordered the Norwegian Benedict, which includes smoked salmon and the total was around $15. You can choose potatoes or salad as a side. The potatoes are cutely cut but have absolutely no flavor. It doesn't even seem to have salt or pepper. The Benedict is average but the smoked salmon was a little salty.There are better breakfast/brunch places further around the area that I would suggest over this.",0.5522
18-Dec-19,Tried the place for the first time. The menu has many breakfast items.  Delicious. I will go back to try others on the menu. French toast is very good. All Benedict is good as well. Friendly service.,0.937
15-Dec-19,"Excellent food and customer service ! Their egg Benedict is not super rich but just all right, salad dressing is a bit sour but prefect to bring your appetites up. I ordered a latte with almond milk, a little bit bitter Coffee taste combined with the egg Benedict makes a prefect breakfast combination. This is a Must Go place for me every Sunday morning.",-0.6439
15-Dec-19,"Decided it to try this place after I found it on yelp. We got Norwegian Benedict and California omelette, both are awesome, staff are very friendly and interior are modern. It's a really nice place to hang out with family and friends. I am so happy there's a brunch place in 626 close to me",0.957
15-Dec-19,"Ordered from UberEats, charged my credit card. UberEats app showed driver picked it up, then the app showed the food was delivered but the driver never showed up. Called the restaurant, Jason answered and said they didn't turn on Ubereats and told me to call Ubereats. Really? I understand that some restaurants turn off UberEats when they're busy, but in the app the restaurant would have shown as ""unavailable"" and I wouldn't be able to place an order. Also, if they did turn UberEats off, why would the app mark it as picked up by driver? The order would have been cancelled in the app during the restaurant confirmation step. Obviously they messed up and told me to contact UberEats instead of fixing their mistake. Mistakes happen and it's how a business handles them that count. This restaurant doesn't give any crap about their mistakes and leave the customers hanging. Don't waste your money here.",-0.8653
15-Dec-19,"We decided to stop by here to kick off my boyfriend's birthday celebration. It wasn't the worst mistake, but it wasn't the best. We ordered at the front - Open faced smoked salmon sandwich, Norwegian Benedict, popping yolk burger,  two coffees and an orange juice. We chose our seats and waited for the food to come out. Our drinks came out first - 1 OJ and 1 coffee. We mentioned to the server that we had ordered two coffees, but she told us that they only punched in one. She then asked us if we still wanted the coffee, which I said yes. She came out to tell us that we owed $4. $4!!! - for a simple black coffee. I said forget it and just stuck with my water. Food came out and it was okay. I felt like the food can be made at home, but it was at least decently priced. Going back to drinks, after we found out how absurdly expensive the coffee was, we checked on how much the OJ was and it was $5! I don't think there's any justification to why OJ and coffee are this expensive, considering there is a Starbucks next door, where I can get a flavored latte for the same price. Lastly, if you missed the punch for an extra coffee, that's on the restaurant, and rather than charging your customers $4 for black mediocre coffee, you should have just given it. Ridiculous. The only reason for the one star is the food was ok, at best. Stay away from this place.",-0.8465
10-Dec-19,Food was amazing I would give 5 stars but the potatoes  needed some seasoning they had no taste very plain but everything else was amazing the orange juice was fresh! My family enjoyed the food and would def come back again :),0.9551
9-Dec-19,"This spot had been keep changing style but I think they finally find the style that work.This is a brunch specialist restaurant that only open in late morning and late afternoon, doesn't open in evening. They had variety of items but most common were toast and eggs benedict.  I really enjoy their toast and is very tasty.  The give you decent portion and fair value.  If you like brunch then you should consider checkout this spot.",0.933
9-Dec-19,"This place definitely fills a void of breakfast spots in the SGV. The service is friendly you order at the counter and a number is given to you. A waiter will bring you coffee but they are not prompt with refills but friendly when you ask them to.I tried the popping yolk breakfast plate with bacon and sausage with two eggs. They only offer the eggs sunny side up or scrambled, I saw another table try to order it over medium eggs and the staff was confused. It comes with breakfast potatoes and a salad which I enjoyed immensely.My date ordered the California omelette which he presumed had bacon but I did not. It was a lot of spinach and mushrooms with a drizzle of pesto over it. Overall it was a OK omelette but I feel that the flavors could have been better if there was a bit more pesto sauce inside of the omelette to balance out the large amount of spinach.Definitely would try the Spot again although there is also the Diner on Main next-door that has other classic breakfast foods that I was looking for that this place does not have. This is a very Instagramable place and their food is good!",0.9788
8-Dec-19,"Aptly named, Poppin yolk serves up eggs in a multitude of ways.  If shrimp is the fruit of the sea, then eggs are the corn of the land: cheap, plentiful, and adaptable, and like Bubba said..You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it.  Which are all things that Poppin yolk does, and all things that you can do too from the comfort of your own home.From the perspective of a value oriented diner, Poppin yolk doesn't appear to offer anything special, and even unique items land poorly on the spectrum of originality and umami.Like a basic bitch, I ordered the Poppin Yolk burger, because a good litmus test of an eatery is to keep it simple right?  Well, the mood of the afternoon for this lunch service was a solid mediocre.  That's right folks, you too can fire up the grill pan at home, craft yourself an excellent burger, add a pan-fried egg on top of the party and call it ""OP's Creme de la Cr√®me Burger of the century"".This is all in jest, as I did finish my burger in its entirety, and enjoyed it!  Comically though, I would have thought that the side portion of sweet potatoes fries would match those of the regular fries that I saw being sent out, so keep that in mind if you're looking for those orange crack sticks over your usual preferred golden crisp starch fix.For the price, vibe, and overall experience, would I come back?  Probably not!  There's plenty of other places on Main St to take my $10-$18 dollars.Tl;Dr this place is A-OK!",0.9727
8-Dec-19,"I came in here for breakfast and ordered the Popping Yolk breakfast that comes with lots of crispy potatoes, a side salad, bacon, sausage,  eggs and a slice of toast all for $12. We also ordered and the half size of the Toffee Banana French toast for $5.50. This restaurant is pretty new and has been opened for approximately 5 months. You order at register,  grab a number and seat yourself in the restaurant.  The coffee which is refillable was great and the waitresses are very sweet and attentive with the refills. I absolutely loved how much food you get for the Popping Yolk breakfast and I actually welcome the side salad which is very unconventional for breakfast, but gets you to eat your veggies. You not only get one choice of meat but both bacon and sausage. The Toffee Banana French toast was my absolute favorite.  It was crispy, crunch but soft in the middle and the sauce was perfectly sweet with the light fluffy whip cream. I would highly recommend. The decor is modern and there was a lot of seating for a Saturday morning. There is parking on the street or near by at the local parking structure or parking lots.Overall,  I really enjoyed the experience from the food to the service and would highly recommend.",0.9899

3-Dec-19,"Was looking for a new spot to grab some breakfast and came across this yolk cake. My boyfriend and I love eggs and yolk so definitely had to give it a try. Upon entrance, we were greeted and informed that it was indeed a cafe and not a restaurant, even though they brought us the food and drinks to our table. The menu was interesting, including poached eggs, salmon, crepes, burgers, salads, french toast, and an array of sides ranging from mozzarella sticks to onion rings. I decided to get the Avocado Benedict while my boyfriend got the Original Popping Yolk Breakfast. They served us water in cute glasses and a refillable bottle, although the water had lemon inside it already, and it wasn't a flattering taste. We received our food, and aesthetically it looked great. The potatoes were Potatoes O'brien I believe. The salad came with a sauce on it, that my boyfriend didn't enjoy. The sauce that came with my food tasted like the metalcontainer it came in, which I didn't enjoy. The food, overall, was average at best. The decor was cute, but a bit all over the place. And to wrap it all together, our bill came to around $35. Quite pricey for an experience I wish I could have enjoyed more. I may come back once more to try to french toast, because it did look promising, but as far as the eggs, which is the pinnacle of this cafe, were basic. Two stars for making me regret spending so much on food I didn't really enjoy.",0.9524
1-Dec-19,"Popping Yolk Cafe is a new breakfast and brunch restaurant on Main st and 1st street. It's atmosphere was inviting and charming. The interior was spacious, neat, clean and well lit. Their low and high tables and chairs were  evenly spaced. Moreover, they have a marble counter top full bar which added more seating. Perfectly situated infront of their two 35 inch flat screen tv. We came here one weekend for breakfast. Customers need to order at the front desk/cashier counter before getting a table. They have a wide selection of food and drink on their menu. We ordered a full-classic french toast and scrambled eggs. Their french toasts/eggs has good presentation and were served on a white rectangular ceramic plate with whip cream on two sides of the plate. The thick french toasts were coated with sweet brown sugar, sprinkled blueberries and strawberries with maple syrup. Scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked. Both were tasty, soft and flavorful. I honestly think sugar coating the french toasts were unnecessary. Service was moderately fast. Staff were tremendously helpful, competent, amiable and professional. Prices were fair, affordable and competitive. Overall, we had a great breakfast and highly recommend this cafe restaurant.",0.9926

30-Nov-19,"It's really nice to see up and coming restaurants in Alhambra. Not entirely sure how new it is, but the experience was wonderful. Came here earlier this morning, and of course what's breakfast without eggs! I ordered the Popping Yolk Breakfast with scrambled eggs, and my guy ordered the Popping Yolk Burger. We also ordered a side of popcorn chicken (mild). Overall, the food was standard, but in a positive way. This meal did not disappoint. In fact, we haven't anything else to eat because this first meal of the day was so filling. This is an establishment that makes classic food better, but not better as in different. They really made breakfast feel like it was the most important meal of the day. Service was delightful, and the young hostess working today made us feel welcomed from the moment we stepped in. From first order to last bite it was a great experience, and it certainly will not be the last. TIPS: Parking: two parking lots in the vicinity of the restaurant, and street parking! This is also a first come first served seating arrangement. You can only be seated after there is someone to take your order.",0.9934
30-Nov-19,Great breakfast and really good service. The theme of the restaurant is very obvious so if you love a good sunny side up egg this is your spot. Just add a little pepper for some seasoning and the burger was delicious and melts in your mouth.,0.97

The egg is little dry, but the avocado make it a good match . The orange juice is freshly made . Price is reasonable due to the big portion.",0.7003
27-Nov-19,"This is new to the neighborhood. Generous portions and fresh tasting dishes, I've only done breakfast but the eggs benedict was fantastic. The hollandaise tasted home made. ( not a gravy like some places). The salad on the side was a nice touch, the dressing was interesting.... The ice tea was good, that's major for this tea lover. It's a place worth going to, the seating was benches and a lot of bar stool type tables. ( doesnt't work for this shorty) The prices are appropriate and parking is amazing in Alhambra. It's free and ample. (makes Alhambra my number one place to go)",0.9864

26-Nov-19,"Popping Yolk is hidden gem in Downtown Alhambra, it's only been here since August but I could see it making a last impact in the food culture in SGV. I stopped in today on my way to work to get a quick break sandwich, I looked at a lot of other options before coming into Popping Yolk. The first impression was everything for me, the staff that helped me was really nice and the ambiance and decor was well put together. The floral wallpaper was a great touch to tie in the whole design scheme of an up scale brunch spot in the heart of Alhambra. When I browsing through the menu I just kept coming back to the sandwich section and I ended up going with the Avocado Ham sandwich on a croissant which two HUGE over easy eggs. What would the sandwich be without that right ? When you are getting ready to eat this sandwich get ready for a mess that will be totally worth it. The sandwich's flavor profile was well put together with all the textures meshing well in the end. You also get a choice of a side, I chose the country fried potato! Can't wait to stop by and try the rest of the menu.",0.9875
25-Nov-19,"This cafe was alright. You come in and you either get seated or you order at the front (menu on the screen but all the drinks are on the BACK of the paper version). Ordering at the front looked inconsistent from what I observed because the host would move back and forth from the cashier to help out with orders, maybe more staff is needed? The cashier also seemed a bit flustered because she didn't hear part of my order and she asked if we were okay with water... but we didn't get water until halfway through our meal. Also the water cup smelled like fish which made it really unappetizing. Cute decor and had a trendy vibe, but the food was meh. Got two Norwegian Eggs Benedict and the cream cheese wontons (BEST THING TO ORDER). Super yummy, sauce was buttermilk ranch though, kinda weird. I opted for salad in the eggs benny and my friend got the potatoes. The salad is literally spring mix, some canned corn and tomatoes cut in half, drizzled with the tartest vinaigrette I've ever had (literally you can make this salad at home). On the other hand my friend got huge portions for potatoes... half the plate was covered in it. As for the eggs benedict, there was some spinach, the lox/salmon was really salty (packaged ones probably), the eggs were cooked fine, but the muffin at the bottom was hard to cut into... I think the dish would meld better if they adjust their salad to something more unique, especially change the dressing.",0.9902
24-Nov-19,"I was disappointed with the pulled pork eggs benedict. They eggs were very runny. I asked for eggs that were more well done. Instead of the male server taking the entire plate and making a fresh plate, he brought me two more runny eggs. Honesty, everything in the restaurant looked delicious. The pulled pork was yummy. I'm not one to ask a server to fix my dish once, let alone twice. I left the restaurant hungry and jaded. The dish and coffee (which was tasty) cost over $20.00. The service was good and the food came quickly, maybe that was the problem?",0.8297
22-Nov-19,"Update Nov 2019: gave them another chance and still greatly disappointed. Food was meh, service was meh, ambiance was bad (super crowded)... for the price they charge, this is not worth it at all. Don't waste your time and money here. Go get brunch in pasadena.",-0.7029
21-Nov-19,"Disappointed.Food:Tried the kimchi spam omelette. Sounded like an amazing Asian fusion idea but sadly did not deliver. I am not one to not finish my food because I'm cheap as fuck, but this omelette did not meet and actually sank below expectations. Overtly salty and was drowning in kimchi fluids. (Picture attached) I physically did not feel good after eating it and sorely regret having ordered it. I do know however that this was a new dish item so perhaps they are just tweaking it to perfection but man, it was hard to consume. My friend got the California Omelette and he thought it was too salty as well. Restaurant Architecture:The structure of this place is a tad funky. Right when you walk in the door is the cashier, in which you would order from before you could be seated. Brunch is not heavily prevalent in 626 so you can imagine how long the line would grow instantly seeing that Popping Yolk is the only American style brunch in the area (not counting Pasadena.) With lines growing and people having to scrunch up in the small waiting area, or having to wait outside in the rain or blazing sun is definitely not ideal. Would suggest having the cashier somewhere else to allow more room for people to wait. Tables are also super close together and there is barely any walking room for not only the customers but the servers as well. Would suggest to get rid of some. Service: It was good! Cashier was really friendly and gave me water as I waited. Servers seem pretty chill too but they do wear their stress on their face. As the place got more and more packed, their smiles dissipated and I got the feeling that they gradually became annoyed at our requests. But they do do their best! It's a strong effort and I would be annoyed too with so many people demanding in such a cramped spaced.Overall I probably, maybe, 30% miiiiight come back after the hype dies down or when they figured out all the kinks of this place.",0.9684
18-Nov-19,Came here on Sunday around 12 and it was quite packed. This place is an order and find a seat type of restaurant. My friend and I had the house french toast and it was quite delicious! The half comes with 3 pieces and full comes in 6 which is very generous for the price. Super cute aesthetic with all the greenery!,0.96
18-Nov-19,"Brunch foods with an Asian flare. Nothing super special, but pretty tasty food. I had the ham, avocado, and egg croissant. The croissant was definitely not one of the honeycomb airy viennoiseries from France, kinda floppy and not crisp. But the eggs were perfectly done in my book which made up for it! Also, I tried the kimichi spam omelet which was too spicy for my taste. But, the kimchi was delicious and would love to try making something similar at home.The place was busy early Sunday morning as expected, but we were seated quickly after ordering in the front. They ran out of a few menu things (truffle burger, some drink options), but probably won't go back to Alhambra just to try them. Overall, it was ok for a quick brunch bite a pricey for what it is though.",0.9767
26-Oct-19,"Delicious food and got there early enough for lunch to see how busy it got about about 30-45 minutes after I got there at 10:45am, on a Sunday. It's a little pricey, but I was satisfied. I'll definitely come back but not during the ""prime time hours"".",0.8625

22-Oct-19,"Overall a not bad experience, and actually really glad they opened this up in Alhambra because there are rarely any boujee egg Benedict's restaurant in the 626 lol my friend and I luckily went at a good time Saturday morning because once we sat down the place started to crowd up. How they decided to run their business by having customers pay before sitting is quite efficient! The previous restaurant was just as good, hopefully everything runs smoothly for y'all, good luck!",0.985
19-Oct-19,Great place for brunch with the family. I loved the atmosphere it is so modern in there,0.8402
18-Oct-19,"The egg sausage sandwiches were pretty basic.  The taste was so-so.  Prices are not very competitive.  So I was a little unhappy with the value for money.   However the restaurant messed up my wive's order not 1 time, not 2 times, but 3 times.   How difficult is it to make an scramble egg sandwich.  We gave up on her order and walked out.  The restaurant took 4 days to refund the money.",-0.5272
17-Oct-19,I was here for brunch and stumbled upon this restaurant. This use to be a restaurant called Next Republic but same owner. This place is good for friends and a quick breakfast. I really enjoyed their French toast. It was like no other I've had and very crispy. I would get a half order next time. I like the fresh OJ and the eggs benedict was enough to satisfying my hunger. It comes with salad or potato bites and you order yourself in the front all self order.,0.9721
17-Oct-19,"Tried this place about a month after its grand opening. At first, I was excited to try out an egg-themed restaurant. However, there is nothing really special about the establishment. The food is good, but nothing extremely good that would make someone go out of their way to eat. I feel like the food is a little overpriced. On the other hand, the food does have pretty good flavors and fills you up pretty well.The real reason this place gets a 3 star is due to the fact that the staff is very unenthusiastic. When I was taking my order, there was no friendly attitude. The hostess was very dull and had sounded like she did not want to be there. In addition, the servers would place our food down quite aggressively. Furthermore, it was very hard to get a hold of a waiter when wanting something. For example, my family and I were in a slight rush and needed the check, but all the waiters did not look in our direction or hear us calling to them from our table. We had to go up to the ordering counter and ask for the check there, which was difficult with the line of people in the way ordering.Overall, the food was not that bad, but the service was not very good, which is why this review is 3 stars.",0.982
17-Oct-19,"I was excited to see a breakfast place in Alhambra that had good reviews. Popping Yolk definitely didn't live up to expectations. I ordered the Popping Yolk Breakfast - 1 star. It's like they didn't even try The bacon was undercooked and soggy, the scrambled eggs were ok, the hash browns really shouldn't be called hash browns . They were more like home fries. The potatoes probably would've been ok except it taste like they fried it in oil that has gone rancid because they haven't replaced it in so long. I still have that gross taste in my mouth.  I tried to eat as much as I could because I had just spent $20 on breakfast. I also ordered the French toast. The texture was good. It was probably a tad to sweet for me. The French toast also had that same rancid oil taste. You can't taste it at first because of all the sugar but the oil leaves an after taste in your mouth. The service was quick but that could've been because it was a weekday.",0.7469
14-Oct-19,"Came here earlier today and ordered the Norwegian Benedict as well as the mango green tea. I loved how the green tea was refillable and the servers were really attentive in refilling it  Really liked the Benedict as well! I got it with the side salad and everything was really fresh. Would definitely go back because it's a great place to chill, read and do some work as well.",0.9692
13-Oct-19,"I'm a fan of this newer brunch spot on Main St! It's cute, charming, and relaxing with their softer vibes, bright atmosphere, and fast casual service with a slight full service twist if you were to factor how often someone came to our table to fill our waters.I came here on a spontaneous brunch date with my boyfriend on a Sunday late morning. The place was pretty packed with many pairs and smaller groups. At a glance, with their communal tables and space, this is an ideal spot to bring your friends and family together.While it's challenging to impress someone with an egg dish, I do believe the chefs at Popping Yolk Cafe have done a great job elevating a common breakfast staple that someone can easily make at home on their own. For example, their juicy scrambled eggs in their ""Popping Yolk Breakfast"" was quite heavenly considering how fluffy the eggs were. I opted for their smoked salmon omelette and was pleasantly surprised with how my meal looked. Both dishes came with scrumptious hash browns that were crispy on the outside and soft in the inside with light seasoning. The only thing I did not like was their toast- it just didn't meet up to the quality this spot was going for.Price is decent in my opinion for the portion you're getting. The next time I come back, I want to try their smoked salmon croissant sandwich because I couldn't take my semi-creepy eyes off of my neighbor's meal...",0.993
12-Oct-19,"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Casual brunchin.  Ordered at the front counter. Get your number and they'll bring your order to your table. I ordered the avocado Benedict with hash brown. The Benedict was good. I love hollandaise sauce. The poached egg was just right. The hash brown were really like country potato type. Orange juice was fresh. But pricey imo.  Overall, Decent place. I would come back.",0.8378
12-Oct-19,"09/25/2019Brunch starts at 8am to 3pm. when you come in, you order at the front counter and then find a seat. Sort of different from a typical restaurant. What is that called, fast casual? What really looked good are the choices for eggs Benedict. Just for coming to try it out, we could order anything we would like to try. My Yelp friend and I both wanted the salmon Benedict. I loved how the yolk comes running down the front and the sides covering every part. I like how the potatoes were cooked. Nice and crunchy but it was definitely a lot of potatoes. I didn't get to finish the potatoes but the salmon and spinach with the Benedict were certainly gone. The coffee is so good so I drank it black.",0.9655
12-Oct-19,"If i could rate this place 0 stars i would. My boyfriend and i each ordered eggs benedict with hash brown. We waited over 30 minutes for our food, and when the food finally came, it was room temp. Nowhere close to being hot or tasting like it's freshly made. How can you take so long to serve room temperature food? What made it worse is that we had to pay and tip first before being seated. Instantly regretted paying $30 for terrible food and nonexistent service. Pretty disappointed from all the rave reviews about this place. Wouldn't be coming back. Hope this place gets replaced by a more worthy business. Bad food is bad mood.",-0.8303
12-Oct-19,"Food did not disappoint and if you get here before 10:45am the wait isn't too bad. After 11, the wait is very long. It is a order first, then find a table to sit at restaurant. The food was very good and filling for the pricing. The hash browns (cut potatos) were okay, they need seasoning as they were a bit bland but other than that the food was delicious and the atmosphere was fun.",0.9393
9-Oct-19,"-came on weekday. order at counter and find a seat. May be harder on weekends so plan ahead or give yourself time? Heard it can get busy on weekends-Friendly staff, portions are great for price (i feel like similar places would give you half the amount for the same price).  -Loved the french toast! We shared the half order-The dressing on the popping yolk breakfast was to acidic for my personal taste. I can understand why since its bacon and sausage and hash(actually its just chopped french fries, not complaining tho. FRENCH FRIES! *kirby inhale* ). Other then that, i really enjoyed the popping yolk breakfast plate.   What place gives you bacon and sausage for only $12 or $13 and all that food?!",0.9602
9-Oct-19,This place makes me happy whenever I want a little treat for myself. Their crunchy waffles are my all time favorite and it's hard not to over eat. Their breakfast and eggs are cooked to perfection especially the poach style eggs. The hash potatoes are nice and crunchy but it's more like French fries just cut short but none the less still tasty. Will definitely come back again.,0.916
9-Oct-19,"First we went the restaurant was closed for an event, was a bit disappointed about this. Gave it another chance. Went on a Saturday around noon. Restaurant was a bit busy, all tables were taken, not a long wait. Our drinks took longer than expected to get to us. The food took a long time.  No one checked on us. Once the restaurant got emptier that's when we were getting checked on. I had to flag someone down for more ice. They leave room temperature water on the table. Food is not that good the crepes have this yogurt filling inside. My sandwich was really greasy. You have to sit yourself. You order, you get a number and you start hunting for a table.",-0.7629
6-Oct-19,"I heard a lot about this place all over the social media, they have 2 locations now, Alhambra and hacienda hrs. Since I was visiting my friend in Pasadena, we chose the Alhambra location. We walked in on a busy sun morning, line was long out of the door but it moved quickly. We got French toast, smoke salmon Benedict, California omelette bottle mimosa. food took about 15 mins. But food were excellent. Ingredients tasted fresh, fresh oh r huge plus Staff were very friendly, I might go to hacienda location next time since it closer for me",0.9672
6-Oct-19,"I was really excited to try this place and then... I was very underwhelmed. You enter and pay first before you order. The food came out pretty quickly which was plus. I ordered Norwegian Bededict for 13.50 which is kind of okay price for a Benedict. But when I got my food the flavor was meh. Egg wasn't seasoned, hollandaise sauce did not have any taste what so ever and I was hoping/expecting some kind of acidic toppings (lemon juice or capers) to counter fishy salmon but there wasn't anything. The waiters/waitresses were nice but not sure if I will be to going back.",0.5936
5-Oct-19,"First heard of this place through a family friend and wanted to try it out because there aren't many breakfast places like this near my house! This restaurant is located right on Main street and its hard to miss because the outside of the restaurant is bright yellow!! I came here on a Saturday morning around 8:45 AM and I was lucky enough to find parking right in front of the restaurant (but don't worry there's a parking garage around the corner if you can't find one)When you first walk in, you order at the cashier before given a number to sit down. I would recommend looking at their paper menu because it's the most updated while they don't sell some of the items on the menu on the screen. I tried to order their open faced toast and was told that they no longer sell it.The food itself was delicious and came out pretty quickly. My favorite part of the meal was probably the hash browns because it was seasoned perfectly. I though the sandwich could have had more avocados but that is also a personal preference. As for the interior, it's quite dark on the inside which contradicts the exterior of the location. I understand that there isn't a lot of window space available because it is located between two shops, but I think that adding some brighter color furniture could help a lot. Overall, I think that this cafe will become more popular as more and more people discover this location. And with it being located on a a very popular street, I predict that many people will start to come here soon.",0.9804
5-Oct-19,"Extraordinarily slow service and meals come out one at a time not by table. One meal came out 20 minutes after we sat and the second meal came out 30 minutes later! The same was happening to all the other tables around us. Seems they make one type of dish at a time in bulk in the kitchen. What's worse, you pay and tip before you even sit down. Food was only average too. Not recommended.",-0.658
4-Oct-19,"Before arriving I had high expectations when viewing the photos of the food. I thought the presentation was adorable with the flowers on the food. When I arrived the atmosphere was cute. They had industrial and geometric lighting and cute potted flowers hanging from the ceiling. They also had cute lush designed wall paper. Looking at the menu, pricing was affordable for the amount of food I received. The hash browns were more of what I would call country potatoes. They were amazing! They had rosemary or some sort of herb seasoned on them and they were cooked perfectly. Not too crispy but not under cooked; just right. I had the arugula sandwich, which was good. Overall, I don't know if I would come here again only because it wasn't something that I couldn't cook at home and the presentation wasn't done as shown in the images. My meal nor my friends came with the flower presentation. If you're just looking for a quick breakfast or brunch spot though, you should try it.",0.8981
3-Oct-19,"COST:$14.50 (Smoked Salmon Omelette)$13.50 (Norwegian Egg Benedict)$14.50 (Truffle Burger)$9.50 (House French Toast)$8 (Mimosa)Ya boy's always down for brunch so I went to this place early in the morning to chow. It was a cloudy Thursday morning so of course I had to order a mimosa. This one's pretty good and definitely has more champagne than OJ which I liked.Started with the omelette which had a very generous portion (all of the dishes did actually). The eggs were light and fluffy and came with breakfast potatoes. These potatoes were actually really good too and came with the egg benedict and burger as well. My favorite dish was the bennys. I'm a big benny fan so go figure. The poached eggs were cooked just right and their muffin tasted baked fresh. I wish I'd gone with a side salad since I definitely had a potato overload after this meal. Had a taste of the truffle burger. It was good but it was probably my least favorite of the dishes I had that day. It was missing something in addition to the patty, egg and the truffle. Maybe onions or some other garnish. The French Toast was the perfect way to cap off the meal with something sweet. Overall I'd go back again though the meal presentation could use a little work. Their space is too pretty I'd wish they rework some of their food presentation as well.",0.9894
3-Oct-19,"Breakfast for 2Food: We ordered the eggs Benedict with avocado with a side of hash browns and the popping yolk breakfast. Both items were omg so delicious! Normally when a place looks nice sometimes the food is lacking in flavor, but this place has both good decor and great taste!! Portion of food was perfect. I love the crispy hash browns too!

2-Oct-19,"Brunch is my favorite kind of thing on weekends but would love to do it whenever I can on weekdays. It just happened one day when a couple of my friends wanted brunch so I joined them without knowing where we're headed to.I had no idea they'll be taking me to this new place in Alhambra that's popping in social media. Coincidentally, the place was literally popping when we came in. It's quite busy but luckily, we found a table and seated ourselves.We decided to order the following:*Smoked salmon omelette Smoked salmon, spinach, mushroom, toast*Norwegian omelette Poached egg, smoked salmon, spinach, english muffin, hollandaised sauce*Truffle burgerAngus beef, egg, truffle sauce, cheddar *House French toastDeep-fried toast, mixed berries, maple syrup, condensed milkFirst of all, the portions were generous so we were able to share liberally amongst each other. The omelette was pretty good. I liked that the smoked salmon wasn't salty which is a very common trait in other places. It's delicious! I loved it! I was hesitant to order the Norwegian because just like the omelette above, this one also has smoked salmon. My friends won me over this but to my surprise, it's one outstanding choice. Eggs were perfectly cooked but nope, I didn't do the popping of yolk aka #yolkporn in social media. The burger might not be a great choice for brunch but to feed our curiosity, we went ahead and ordered it. Ha! We were even surprised how good it was, sane with the side salad. That egg on top of the patty sure did stick with the egg theme but added so much flavor, too to the patty. For dessert, we can't be happier with the house French toast. Fruits were very fresh and although syrup and milk were added, it wasn't over saturated. It had the perfect level of sweetness I set for my desserts. For our drinks, one had regular coffee (refillable), one had mimosa while I had the white peach oolong hot tea. The tea was really good. It was fruity but not sweet which makes it perfect with the entrees mentioned above and much more, with the French toast.",0.9985
30-Sep-19,"My first visit here on 9/29/19 and unfortunately, I am not convinced on coming back.When we first entered the establishment, a young woman just stared at us so I approached her first and asked for a table for 3. She then told us that we have to order first then take a seat. I hope they understand that as of a somewhat new establishment, it would help if their customer service was better. She could have been more welcoming and asked if it was our first time dining there and walk us through the process instead of sounding condensing. We ordered the Popping Yolk Breakfast and the Classic Benedict. The meal includes hash brown, but umm.. I don't think they know what hash brown means. Instead, they served us country potatoes. They were not bad, but I felt a little deceived and I would have went for their ""Garden Spring"" salad instead.My eggs on the benedict was undercooked. A poached egg should have a runny yolk, but I was also getting the runny whites of the egg too. Their breakfast platter was pretty basic so no complaints there. Their coffee was probably not fresh when it got to us because it tasted sour.Overall, I thought the price was a bit high; however, the portion was filling.  Side note: I thought it was weird they had a wine bottle of cold water on every table before customers even arrived and they brought out coffee refill in a Sapporo-labeled pitcher...",-0.3649
30-Sep-19,Wow this place is amazing. The French toast is so yummy and crispy. The smoked salmon omelette was cooked perfectly just the way I like it. The cashier and servers were friendly. The servers came by often to refill our drinks. Will be back soon,0.9715
30-Sep-19,"Came here for breakfast on an early Sunday morning. This is casual spot where you order your food at the counter, but the decor here is cute and trendy.My husband and I tried the avocado benedict (w/ bacon instead of ham), open-faced smoked salmon sandwich, and crunchy toffee banana french toast. The eggs for both savory dishes were nicely cooked, but the bacon wasn't crispy enough. I would've preferred a more buttery, flaky croissant and the salmon could've used more of a smoky flavor, but overall the croissant sandwich was quite tasty. The home fries were simple yet delicious and were the perfect sides. The french toast was my favorite dish! It had the perfect crunch on the outside along with a nice crumb.Service was good. The entire staff was very friendly and made sure to refill our coffees. I did feel a bit rushed towards the end, but the place got pretty busy halfway through our meal so I think they were trying to make room for other diners.Parking was easy, since there was an open public lot around the corner (2-hour limit during the day).This is a great spot for breakfast/brunch if you're in the area. I want to go back for more french toast and to try out other dishes!",0.9962
30-Sep-19,"While I would've otherwise given this place a higher score, they get a 3 out of 5 from me because of time. We came on a Monday morning and the Popping Yolk Cafe wasn't even busy. We literally waited 25 minutes for the Popping Yolk Burger order. I was carefully watching who else they would've serve first. The hash browns are really actually chopped potatoes. Seasoned well. Classic eggs Benedict does look good. Too bad because we waited so long, it tastes not as good cold. Mango green tea was good. Little crushed ice cubes are a nice touch.Main concern: time of food prep.Not sure I would recommend or come back.",0.8977

I also had their truffle fries, yum! And hashbrowns, which are more like potatoes (I know, hash browns are potatoes, but these weren't your typical looking hashy's. Still great though! You order when you walk in then have a seat. Seems like several restaurants are doing this nowadays. I like it. It saves time and when you sit you're basically just waiting for your food.

26-Sep-19,"I wanted to like this place due to the yelp reviews and limited brunch options around the area, but it did not quite meet my expectations. I decided to get one of their recommended dishes which was the California omelette. I would have to say I was not at impressed with it since I felt there was too much pesto. It was just okay and I probably would never order it again. My friend got the Popping Yolk Breakfast and was disappointed with the non-crispy bacon. The potatoes were not bad though. Cashier was okay. She could probably put on a smile and be a little more welcoming. It was open table seating, so just order at the cashier and you will be given a number, and then find a table. Ambiance is nice and fitting for a brunch place. A good place to have brunch with friends or family.There is street parking or a parking structure on 1st Street. Overall, it was okay and food was mediocre. Maybe I'll give it a second chance later. I do want to try their eggs Benedict since they look delicious in pictures.",0.9894

24-Sep-19,"My friend and I were heading towards a convention in Pasadena and needed to fuel-up for a long day. I was recommended by another friend to hit up Popping Yolk Cafe and since it was in Alhambra it was totally on the way. Upon entering you'll order at the counter then pick a table to enjoy the offerings. I pondered on what to get and while I don't typically order sweets the Toffee Banana French Toast sounded really bomb, and it didn't not disappoint.  The Toffee Banana French Toast was crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. It had a Captain Crunch type of sweetness to it and paired with the maple syrup and cream was heavenly. I gobbled it all up and basically licked the plate clean.  My friend ordered the ham and cheese omelette which came with a side of hash-brown, though I think it's actually house fries. Regardless the potatoes were perfectly fried and had a similar consistency as the French Toast in terms of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect execution. The omelette was solid.We both also ordered Orange Juice which was freshly squeeze and complemented our breakfast perfectly. For me I would DEFINITELY come back for the French Toast and considering that it's getting cooler, it's a perfect mid-day snack to indulge in something warm and sweet. Enjoy!",0.9923
13-Sep-19,"Honestly wanted to love this place from the pictures of other yelpers but the taste of the dishes were subpar. I ordered the Norwegian Eggs Benedict and my bf ordered the popping yolk breakfast. Firstly, the hash browns weren't really the normal shredded hash browns, they were more like cut fries. Secondly, the smoked salmon in the Benedict was too salty and the Eggs Benedict sauce I felt was a bit too oily. Overall everything here tasted really mediocre. More like the type food you could put together and make yourself for breakfast so I probably wouldn't come again.On the positive end, the service here is really great, waiters are nice, interior decor of the restaurant is cute, and food came out pretty quickly.",0.9871

12-Sep-19,"I grew up near the Main St. Alhambra scene, and have seen restaurants and stores come and go on these blocks. I hope this one sticks around for a bit. I drove from Burbank to meet with a childhood friend to catch up over breakfast. Weekdays around 10am are pretty empty, but filled up quickly as it was getting closer to lunch time.Order first, then grab a spot, not vice versa. Once you're seated, the wait staff will bring you things like water, extra napkins, etc. I hope no one expects spectacular bus staff, they seem to be mainly college or pt folks.Down to the goods:Classic Benedict with crispy potatoes: The sauce is legit and tastes yummy, in my opinion. I'm sure others are snobs with Hollandaise sauce, but it works here. Bacon isn't greasy. The potatoes...are so delicious here! Not greasy, but crispy. My friend reached over and grabbed a few before I devoured each piece.House French Toast: Honestly, the texture/consistency of the French Toast here can actually rival the infamous ones at Blu Jam Cafes (whaaa?!). There's more than enough to share, but if you have no shame, eat the whole plate. You can claim the berries on it make it ""healthy"".Overall, mellow spot if you're lucky enough to eat during a weekday. From what I've read from yelpers, be prepare to wait on the weekends, but with what we had here, it can be a legit reason to wait.",0.9844
12-Sep-19,Awesome new brunch spot! I love a good eggs Benedict and this place hit those cravings and then some.Came here over the weekend and couldn't decide between sweet or savory so got the Norwegian Benedict and their house French toast to share. The Benedict was perfect! Perfectly poached eggs and lots of flavor. One of my biggest pet peeves is eggs Benedict when the yolks are terrible. So A+ for them on that one.The house French toast was also yummy! It's deep fried so it's crunchy. I've had crunchy French toast before but it was from being cornflake-encrusted. The deep fried French toast was something new but I think I'm a changed woman.Parking is easy--street parking or a giant lot nearby. Definitely give this place a shot!!!,0.9411

10-Sep-19,"Great brunch spot in downtown Alhambra!We came here on a Sunday afternoon around 1:30pm and the place was really busy. We waited a couple minutes and were seated at the bar counter. Since this is the only brunch spot I know of in Alhambra I can see how busy they can get. The menu consists of your typical brunch type foods like eggs benedict, omelettes, french toast, and some lunch items such as sandwiches and burgers. We ended up ordering the smoked salmon omelette with a side of garden spring salad, the Popping Yolk Club sandwich with a side of potatoes, a half order of the house french toast to share, and fresh squeezed orange juice and mango green tea. The stand out items were definitely the house french toast. I loved how it was deep fried so it almost tasted like a crunchy funnel cake topped with whipped cream and berries. I also really enjoyed the smoked salmon omelette, my eggs were cooked perfectly and the smoked salmon and mushrooms really elevated the dish. The other items we ordered were pretty standard and we felt like the Popping Yolk Club was quite underwhelming. The toast to ingredient ratio was a bit off and sadly the egg inside this sandwich was hard boiled so we joked that it was strange they called it Popping Yolk Club when the yolk wasn't even popping. Overall, a new brunch spot is definitely welcomed in Alhambra and I'm hoping to come back again to try their eggs benedict that everyone is raving about.",0.9895
9-Sep-19,"Really cute little cafe in the heart of Alhambra! We ordered the California omelette and the smoked salmon omelette with hashbrowns. Both omelettes were tasty but I wouldn't say they were spectacular. The hashbrowns were technically fried potato cubes but they stole the show. They were really good ""hashbrowns""!

8-Sep-19,"So my sister told me about this new breakfast spot open on main street. So I thought we try it out.  So this place is where Next Republic used to be. My sister ordered Norwegian Benedict and I ordered Avacado Benedict. It does take some time for the kitchen to made this. Even the cashier had said it will be about a 20 minutes wait for the entree to come out. My dish came out first and it plating looks great. Avacado Benedict tasted delicious! It got the hollandaise sauce and perfect poach eggs. It also came with a choice of a side, either garden salad or hash brown. I picked the garden salad and I got to say the salad dressing was on point. When my sister's dish came, I tried here's and it wasn't bad either. It was perfect combination of the poach egg and smoked salmon. Little decors made the ambience of this place is cute and hip. I would definitely come back again. Maybe take my mom and my boyfriend to try breakfast food.",0.9751
8-Sep-19,"Exciting time for a brunch spot to be open in Alhambra! Came in on a Sunday afternoon and there was no wait. You order your food at the counter, get a number, & pick your seating. The interior and aesthetics of the place is very trendy and great for your instagram needs.My friend and I ordered the salmon Benedict as well as the salmon breakfast croissant. As much as I really wanted to like the food, it was kinda basic. There was just a lack underwhelming flavor. The croissant was a little stale/dry and it just felt like they tried to mask it with the spinach and white sauce. The potato's were good though!",0.9564

Serving traditional breakfast dishes, the dishes here are filling and the setting is spacious, with tables, bar tables, and a communal table to house big groups or sharing. We ordered the Norwegian Benedict and the Toffee French Toast: the benedict was great with the smoked salmon but their hashbrown is technically just tiny cubed potatoes pieces and fried (was anticipating the shredded hashbrown) yet still good. The Toffee French toast however was AMAZING! They deep fried the toasts after making the French toasts and the toffee sauce they serve... it was definitely a great spin on the typical French toast. I would highly recommend getting the Toffee French Toast if you're a sweet tooth. Wait time was a bit moderate as it was morning peak hours so expect a decent wait for the dish to arrive. Service was good and had no hiccups during our visit.If you're craving a breakfast spot that's outside the Asian norm of the downtown Alhambra area, you can't go wrong with Popping Yolk Cafe. I would definitely come back to try some more and would I recommend this place to others? A definite yes.",0.9945

8-Sep-19,"Simply put, the food was terrible. We ordered the avocado eggs Benedict, house French toast, and berries crepe. The Benedict was cold and tasteless. The French toast tastes like soggy friend chicken. The berries on both are canned and full of syrup. The crepe was blah. Nutella and ice cream were the highlights of the meal. Service was inattentive and had to ask for water multiple times. The waiter seemed bothered by the request. This is an order and sit place. Overall, not good and could not be paid to eat here again.",-0.3624
8-Sep-19,"American brunch served in Alhambra! You can't miss these bright yellow walls on Main St. The menu is limited but has your essential brunch items such as eggs Benedict, breakfast plates, omelette s, and mimosas. The interior is really cute, with self seating and a bar at the end of the room. There was no AC while I was there, hopefully that changes soon. Food was decent. I will say that the burger I got was better than the brunch items.- popping yolk burger: tasty! The brioche bun was well toasted and the egg was runny enough without causing a huge mess when I cut into my burger. Patty was juicy as well. This comes with a side of either salad or hash browns. The salad was great with a lemony dressing drizzled on top. -popping yolk breakfast: standard breakfast, nothing really special. You get a sample of bacon, sausage, salad, hash browns, eggs, and toast. I'm pretty disappointed by their hash browns. Not the traditional shredded potatoes, but not flavorful enough to be country potatoes either...I might come back to try their eggs Benedict. Perhaps when people come to visit and I'm too lazy to drive to Pasadena.",0.9337
7-Sep-19,"Wanted to try a brunch place in the area. Front entrance is painted a bright yellow and they have a tarp as their sign; the place just opened so I understand. The interior is super cute, and the restroom is small, but clean. You order and pay upon entering; prices are fair! I ordered the avocado Benedict with hashed browns, but i got sliced potatoes instead (?). It was good but not the best I've ever had. The egg muffin could have been warmer and the ham should have been cooked a tad longer. My best friend's mimosa was delicious but the excess pulp distracted from the flavor. Lastly, it is crazy hot in there! It was 94¬∞ degrees outside and inside the restaurant didn't feel much better. Other than that, the restaurant has a chill vibe and the customer service is good. Will probably be returning if ever in the area a",0.841
7-Sep-19,"Do not eat here!!  I came here for brunch on Saturday.  The food was terrible!  The food was cold and what they call hash browns is basically fries cut up into little pieces.  The service was ok but there's a reason the place has changed names serveral times within the last year.  I assume that it's the same owner and same cook (can't even call them chefs cus the food is soo bad) trying to find something that will workout.  Here's a tip to the owner,  try hiring real chefs!!!",-0.4885
5-Sep-19,"The atmosphere of this cafe is really nice. I came with my boyfriend, he had the French toast and I had the Norwegian Benedict with a garden salad. The French toast was amazing! So crispy outside and soft inside, definitely the best French toast I've had. All it needed was a little extra syrup on the side. The Norwegian Benedict was just ok, the salmon was a little too salty and the hollandaise sauce wasn't very flavorful. The garden salad however was extremely delicious! They have a kind of Asian citrus dressing that I absolutely love! We also got the 6$ Cajun fries which were also good but I wish there was a bit more fries included then what we got.

I absolutely love the atmosphere here with the amazing wallpaper and hanging plants above. We ordered the French toast half order, California omelette, and the ham & cheese omelette which came out to be $35. The French toast was so delicious! It was nice and crispy on the outside yet very soft on the inside. The omelettes come with a choice of salad or hash browns. Both omelettes were yummy! Service was quick and they were really nice.

2-Sep-19,"Came here the first time when it was the Next Republic and was definitely not impressed at all. This is actually a great concept for a restaurant. Since we don't really have a popping yolk restaurant around here. It's definitely a trendy concept since people love popping yolks. As we arrived it was definitely busy. Our cashier was definitely not too happy at all. Idk what it was but geez can you crack a smile. Some positivity cause it really made me second guess about this place. Anyways we ordered the yolk club sandwich and the Norwegian eggs Benedict and the toffee banana French toast. As we finally got a seat my food came out pretty fast. As for my girlfriends her food took so long to make. Also we didn't get any water at all, the customer service is definitely lacking in this place. I'm not too sure they know how to handle a busy day. My sandwich was very mediocre. Nothing at all stood out. I actually really can make this sandwich at home. As for my GFs dish it wasn't nothing spectacular either. And the French toast was definitely lack lustering in flavor . Really pictures does it more justice then it is",0.9805

I strongly recommend go for their Benedict their avocado Benedict was amazing there yet you may try different Benedict such as Norwegian Benedict which my friend tried and looked really great ..They have really amazing choice of hot and cold drinks .. I recommend go for their variety of teas since you can find coffee everywhere also don't forget to order their fresh squeezed orange juice..Very comfortable seats and clean tables all the time..Restroom was clean and smelled good..There is parking lot next door which is free . Its on next street just 1 minute walkingPrices are fair to the portion and quality of dishes and most important it was fresh and healthy ingredients with right amount of seasoning and flavor.. nothing was over seasoned . I ordered white peach oolong tea and they served it in tea pot+ cup it was really refreshing .

The omelette was bland, ham is sliced lunch meat ham. Also, the omelette comes with potatoes or salad which is cool. The  thing that was weird is that they give a half a slice to toast. So they take one slice of bread and give only the half of the bread with your meal. I felt ripped off. Hahha, I won't be back. Also, hot as a sauna. The air was not on and it was boiling in there.",0.6358

On top of that, restroom appearance is everything and unfortunately, the restrooms here are disgusting. Toilet paper all over the floor and dirty soap covers. Also, the owner (Jason) shouldn't be complimenting his own restaurant as if he were a customer.

When I walked in around 10am on a Saturday, it was a full house with people waiting in line. I barely found bar seating. I love the aesthetic interior design. Now for the food...! I had the Norwegian Benedict and the House French Toast. I'm very picky when it comes to the Norwegian Benedict because each restaurant seasons its smoked salmon differently but this place has one of the best ones!! The salmon didn't get too fishy or salty and I enjoyed the benedict all the way til my plate was empty. On top of that, the poached egg on top had such perfect, runny yolk. This entree comes with either side salad or side hash brown (potatoes). The House French Toast was the perfect ending to my brunch. I had to eat it after I was done with the benedict, but each bite was still so crispy and perfectly flavorful. It wasn't too sweet but so yummy! I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu items and their freshly squeezed orange juice. Thanks Popping Yolk for an awesome brunch experience! :)",0.9957
25-Aug-19,"Meh. So disappointed. As an Alhambra resident, I was so excited that a brunch place was opening in downtown Alhambra. Unfortunately, this place is mediocre at best and I wouldn't return again.Service: 2/5. Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess at the counter just stared at us, no greeting and looked back at her screen. After staring at her awkwardly for 2 minutes, I then realized we have to order first then get seated. When I asked her ""Ohhh do we order here first?"", she just stared at us like we're idiots and nodded. The worst part --  restaurant DOES NOT have air conditioning. We came on a 90¬∞ day and it was even hotter inside than outside because there's no airflow inside. Within 5 min of sitting down, my boyfriend & I both started to sweat like crazy and it was hard to stomach hot food in that condition. Food: 3/5.We got the Classic Benedict, the Norwegian Benedict and mozzarella sticks. Took about 20 min for everything to come out. The taste for the benedicts were fine, nothing special and definitely doesn't compare to other brunch establishments. One of the poached eggs was overcooked. The mozzarella sticks were pretty good! Overall, I was less than impressed and personally wouldn't return. The initial service really ruined the mood and I wouldn't recommend this place to others.",-0.5213

Once you walk in, you order the food and pay first, the cashier will give you a table number you can just sit whenever you want. Food will be served by the waitress however it's not like ordinarily breakfast place where you sit down then order. I kind of like it that way since it's gonna save my time for waiting for checks, especially when I go with my kiddos by the time they finished eating they would be wanted to leave right away. It is a nice place for friends to hang out as well. It's very spacious inside. Highly recommended!",0.9829
24-Aug-19,"My sister and I decided to try this new brunch place  on Main. I walked in and really liked the decor and the vibe. Really aesthetic. What I didn't like was the lack of AC. It was 90 degrees outside and inside the cafe was also really hot. We asked a worker if he could turn on the AC, and he said it is on, but there are a lot of people inside the cafe so ""the AC isnt as effective."" I was confused at that response because it didn't make any sense at all, but I just left it at that.I ordered a smoked salmon omelette with a side of garden spring salad. I like how they gave us an option to get either hashbrowns or salad. When the food came out, I was pleased. The presentation looked really nice; however, the taste is another story. My smoked salmon didn't taste like smoked salmon. Half of the salmon was cooked and the other half was smoked. So, the combination was confusing and not that good. The inside of the omelette was too wet and the egg was bland. The salad was refreshing. They put corn on the salad, which I liked, but the dressing was not good at all. It was sweet and had a weird taste. Service was alright. Overall, I didn't really enjoy my experience here. It was hot, food wasn't that good, and service was okay.",-0.4504

24-Aug-19,My husband and I was really looking forward to this place so we decided to go last Sunday. Really cute place - nice and open. As soon as we walked in we were trying to find a place in line without blocking the entry/exit. There was one way in one way out. We waited 15 minutes in line to order our food while scoping for a seat from the line. Then the young lady taking order came from behind the counter and let us and a few others waiting know that the kitchen was very busy it would be at least 45 minutes for us to even get our order and she suggested that we go elsewhere if we're really hungry LOL. My husband and I left without hesitation and had some other delicious food a few doors down. This place is really cute and we were happy to see a brunch place near us but the their system needs a little work. I don't think it's a good idea to have a line build up right as people enter. I'm hoping they'll change it and hire servers and seat people and take orders at the table cause that makes more sense. Hoping to return when it's less inconvenient.,0.938

22-Aug-19,"The food was good.  The two stars are for the service we received.First off this is not a full service restaurant.  When you enter the restaurant you have to order and pay then find a seat. There were 2 people in front of us trying to figure out what they wanted, the line kept building up behind us.  The girl taking orders was not knowledgeable about the menu as the customers In front of us inquired about some of their dishes.  She was the only cashier there with a long line of people.  We finally ordered and found a table.  There was only one waitress serving the full dining room maybe 25+ people. We ordered the Avocado Benedict with the garden spring salad, 1/2 order of the House French toast, the popping yolk breakfast and the so-called refillable coffee ($5 per cup).  My friend had the garden spring with the popping yolk breakfast, the salad had a very tasty dressing on it.  My salad was dry as they had forgotten the dressing.. I figured since she all by herself I'd wait for her to come by with the water and coffee I'd requested.Before our food came out we asked the waitress for a coffee refill, she said she was brewing a new batch. After the coffee was done brewing she brought everyone else coffee except us.  We asked her again she said she was brewing another batch.  We were done eating and we were still waiting for our coffee.  She came back and asked us if we still wanted coffee.  I said yes.  She brought out coffee for other people and forgot us again.  At this point we were so disappointed and left.  The food is good but the service sucks. And because of that it ruined our whole dining experience.  For now I wouldn't recommend or ever go back to this place.",-0.8106

21-Aug-19,New brunch place in Downtown Alhambra. There is a parking structure nearby so parking is not a problem and it's free parking.The restaurant inside is clean and good for both big party and small party. We ordered smoked salmon Omelette $14.5 which also has salad on the side and Thai Spicy chicken wings $9.5. We have to share the omelette plate as it's pretty big. Chicken wings are bomb and they are not too spicy. They also offer fresh squeezed orange juice $4.5 which my daughter loves. I plan to return to try the egg Benedict and French Toast next time.I am happy that there is another good place for brunch in 626 area.,0.9824
20-Aug-19,"Hidden Gem in Alhambra, the experience begins with a huge free parking structure nearby.  Modern style w/ a touch of factory design, I was able to have enough personal space while enjoying my meal, unlike another brunch place which people need to seat shoulder by shoulder.  The downside for that would be the wait during my weekend visit, but it is totally worthed.  Stuff was busy while care enough to explain and apologize for the wait.Food, there were a ton of option.  Portions are reasonable to huge.  I was fill by my sandwich but I still saved some space for their French Toast.  Overall I had some great time for my Sunday brunch and definitely will revisit to explore other items on the menu.   side note:My kid loves their fresh-squeezed orange juice, Potato tots came with the order are in tiny pieces, my kid had no problem having fun and eat by themselves.  it would be a kid-friendly restaurant in case people care to know.",0.9879

Thankfully, DT Alhambra comes through with a brunch spot with a great menu that is great for everyone! I tried their Popping Yolk breakfast and their Norwegian eggs Benedict. Their winner here is the hash brown potatoes. I love small potatoes and this place makes it crispy and easy to eat! When I came here on Saturday at noon, this place was packed. I was so happy to try their dishes, and the best part of the meal is indeed their house French toast. It was really crispy with a nice maple syrup drizzle.

At this point 2 other parties had already left because of the wait. The server's explanation was that the kitchen was congested. She said that after the last party's order we would have to wait about 10 minutes before she could take our order and an additional 40 mins before our food could reach our table. She then said that if this was our first time visiting, she didn't recommend that we try their food today. Honestly, neither do I. Terrible service.

My family and I ordered an open faced smoke salmon sandwich, classic benedict, seasoned fries, and a crunchy honeycomb crepe.The service was not good, my husband didn't get his water filled when they were walking around to fill up water glasses. Everything he needed a refill, we had to wait till we see someone to glad them down.The silverware on the table weren't all clean, some had food stuck to them, the OJ we got our daughter has some crusted food stuck to the, thankfully, outside of the cup.My husband got his sandwich first, which I found to be decent, but pricey.Than the fries came out, which was way over priced. Wish I took a photo, today not work it. Then the crepes came out. The ice cream that was in the plates tasted like the lid tub of ice cream had been left open and there was a freezer taste to it. The crepe was a little thicker than expect but nothing to complain about. Though we had a hard time cutting into the crepe with the knives provided.Everything came out before the benedict. I was hoping to like this place as I love benedicts. My meal came out last and too about over 30 mins to come out. Needless to say, I was not happy. I asked that is the food is not done or even started to please cancel and the guys when to the back and checked. He then came back and said 2 minutes. When I got my food it was room temperature. How is it that the meal took so long and is room temperature? I understand the Benedict it's not a hot meal but yet it took forever to come out and was room temperature. The meal was mediocre at best. I would say not worth coming back. And would advise my friends and family of the experience we had.Also note that we saw a lot of unhappy looking patrons as their meal took a long time as well.",0.9771
15-Aug-19,I went the other day with my friend and I really liked it! I got the egg Benedict and the French toast. The muffin in the egg Benedict was fluffy and the sauce was full of flavor. My favorite was the French toast which wasn't too sweet and the texture was perfect!,0.9021
15-Aug-19,"Love the wallpaper here. The decor is very appealing to the eye. I heard about this place opening up and I wanted to check it out. I came here with a friend and we got the House Crunchy French Toast (half size comes with 3 pieces), Florentine Benedict, and Open-Faced Smoked Salmon Sandwich.Presentation of all 3 items were pretty stellar and food came out at a pretty decent pace...although not all of it came out together. The french toast tasted great! it's deep fried and soaked in condensed-milk so it's sweet without having any syrup (although syrup is provided). The benedict was okay and comes with your choice of either a garden salad or hash browns. The salmon sandwich was pretty big.Staff, although friendly, could have been a bit more attentive with refilling our water glasses. The glasses themselves are very small and narrow, so I think it would have been nice to have either pitcher/or bottle left at the table.Note: Free 4 hour parking in structure right off 1st/Main. Also, you pay before you eat and can choose wherever you want to sit.",0.988
13-Aug-19,"This place was yummy n on point.  The Truffle burger was excellent n sauce very tasty.  Also had the Berries Farm Crepe and it was exquisite.  For my beverage, the Orange Juice was rich n great n did not taste acidic.",0.9413
13-Aug-19,"It's hard to find a brunch place in 626 area, I am so happy to see Popping York Cafe opens in Alhambra. I am glad that I tried their brunch last Sunday! I love their yellow store front, so bright and easy to find. Haha! It's really like a popping York! Here are what I ordered:1. Norwegian Benedict     My favorite dish here! They did cook the eggs to perfection! The smoked salmon is super fresh, I like the fresh spinach and on a English muffin. The price is very reasonable compared to so many brunch spots. And it's so healthy if you choose a garden spring salad on the side. 2. California omelette    Super tasty! The best combination of Cherry potato, avocado, mushroom, spinach and pesto. I ordered hash browns on the side, it's very yummy! Not too oily and not over cooked, just the right texture. 3. Strawberry cheesecake crepes     Made with fresh strawberry, corn flakes, creamy cheese spread and strawberry sauce. It's not over sweet and I really enjoyed it. 4. House French toast     I love how crunchy of this dish! Remind me of the one from Blu Jam Cafe. They offer half order, it came with 3 slices. Such a great deal. 5. Sweet potato fries     Just as good as usual.For drinks I got red sangria and white sangria, because it's hard to decide, that's why I got both to. White one is sweeter and red one can taste more wine flavor. They also serve fresh squeezed orange juice, which is so healthy and balanced. All the servers were super nice and friendly, always checked with me how the tastes and what I needed. Will definitely come back to try more!",0.9983
12-Aug-19,"Don't pop the yolk! Oh wait, you can't resist popping the yolk at Popping Yolk Cafe!  I am a lover of brunch and finally the best brunch has arrived. 1. Norwegian BenedictYou can chose from either a side of potatoes or salad. I chose the salad because I was craving greens! The dish had just the right creaminess of Hollandinese sauce and the poached egg was cooked just right for my egg yolk video! 2. French Toast This French toast is not like the normal French toast!! It is very crunchy and is served with a generous amount of berries on top. If you haven't tried crunchy French toast before, let Popping Yolk be your first!! I like the different seating styles at Popping Yolk from bar stools and regular table seatings. The staff is very friendly and always checks up on your table. Also, the menu is clear and easy to read with many different breakfast selections from omelettes, benedicts,french toast, burgers, crepes and salads. If you need a place to do brunch right, Popping Yolk is the place to be!",0.964

12-Aug-19,"I went there with friends today. We have a big party so we have tried a lot of food. The benedicts are all great, and I love avocado best. We also had the yolk and truffle burgers and they can make protein style if you request. and there is a most to try is fresh-made orange juice. It's so delicious!!! For starters, we had wings and calamari, they both are really tasty. Finally, even though we are so full, we tried Barries Farm and Cheesecake Crepes. They both are delicious. The manager is very nice to serve us for small share plates and keep filling up our water. We have a great experience there and will definitely come back",0.9916
12-Aug-19,"My first time to be here. Orange juice is awesome, very fresh and tasty. I loved to have ham and cheese omelette. It is also fresh and light which I really like! Berry Crepe is great too!",0.9668
9-Aug-19,Popping yolk is a brand new brunch restaurant in Alhambra.Foods are fresh. I ordered California omelette and my friend got popping yolk burger and French toast to share. Fresh orange juice is a big plus cause we saw the machine. We also love the decor. 10/10,0.9217
8-Aug-19,"This place is located in the heart of Main St Alhambra. You can park in the structures on 1st St or on the street. My boyfriend and I came here on a Saturday morning for brunch. It was not very busy and we were confused when we first got in because nobody was in the front until a few minutes later. The waitress told us to pay before we get seated, which is fine. We ordered smoked salmon omelette with hash browns, smoked salmon sandwich with salad, and sweet potato fries. After we paid, we get to sit wherever we wanted. Unlike most places, this place actually served our appetizer before our main dishes, which was amazing. However, after we were done with our sweet potato fries, we waited for a really long time until our dishes finally came to our table. I'd say that was at least 20 minutes after we got seated. We were expecting a quick brunch but turned out longer than we expected. Food came and it looked very simple, like what I would make at home for breakfast. Both dishes came out with salads on the side instead of 1 with hash brown and the other with salad (what I ordered). I even double checked my receipt to make sure I ordered hash brown with omelette and that's what it says on the receipt, but I let it go since I already waited long enough for my food to come. Service was mediocre. They didn't give a number to put on our tables so I wondered how they memorized what we ordered. Anyways, it was an okay experience here mainly because the food took too long to serve, food was overpriced, and our order was messed up a little. Don't expect a quick brunch here.",0.8585
7-Aug-19,My boss and I tried this place today for lunch and it was so good. I had their California omelette which is delicious but their Toffee Banana Half french toast was even better! Will definitely come back.,0.9084
7-Aug-19,Came here this past Sunday for breakfast. I had their signature dish which was decent but the greens were dry. My boyfriend's salmon Benedict had good flavor but came out cold. There were no condiments on the table so we had to repeatedly call for our waitress. AND they charged us $5 for a cup of coffee that still had grounds in it. Not to mention creamer containers that looked like it was picked up off the floor (see photo). I can't blame the angry mother who stormed out of the restaurant with plates untouched and her children looking mortified. The potatoes were the one saving grace. The restaurant has a gorgeous industrial chic exterior but lacks any real substance overall - like the human equivalent of a boy toy. Don't bother popping your yolk here until they work out the kinks.,0.9796
7-Aug-19,"Omg. A brand new brunch spot open in downtown Alhambra. What a great news for local here. I came here on a Wed morning with a friend. Amphitheatre is nice, casual. Self service made me feel really comfortable. We got a California omelette, bacon n egg sandwich n French toast. Everything was awesome. Scramble egg is juicy and fluffy. Flavors of California omelette are definitely worth it. Both with handmade harsh browns. French toast we can get half which is nice. I think this place will be packed soon.",0.9722
7-Aug-19,"Very delicate interior design. I love how the owner put their mind into not just the food but also the environment of the restaurant. The smoked salmon Benedict is the first thing I would recommend, very fine cooking skill on the egg! Would like to come again with my friends :)",0.9658
5-Aug-19,"Popping yolk cafe is a new brunch place on main St. I saw it when I drove by. The building is yellow which is very obvious.It's kinda packed on sun for just open 2 days according to the cashier. I got Benedict, omelette and French toast with friends, everything was on point. Only downside is I wait around 15 mins. But I totally understand for them, staff r very nice and attentive.Popping yolk is on my morning breakfast daily list now",0.6897
5-Aug-19,"Popping yolk burger was really, really, really good. Thick juicy patty with a great seared crust, flavorful mushrooms, drippy yolk and honey mustard sauce and brioche bun that doesn't fall apart on first bite. I got the spring mix as a side and it was dressed well too, not too much dressing, not too little. We also had the Florentine Benedict and everything element was well prepared. Hollandaise sauce was creamy, poached egg well made, fresh smoked salmon.However, the hash brown side was bad. Way over browned - many pictures posted can attest to that. Guys, when you cut potatoes this tiny, it's easy to overcook them. When they are this brown, borderline burnt, the potatoes become bitter. Hope they fix this bad part of the breakfast because everything else was nice.",0.9191
5-Aug-19,"I mean this place is obviously still fairly new. I ordered the banana Nutella crepes and there were no Nutella inside the crepes. I mean How could they even forget, and the crepes was a little dried rather than suppose to be moist.  The crepes also came with two scoops of ice cream and the ice cream tasted it's been a while in the freezer , you could taste the frozen taste . And I also ordered the french toast , it was alright compared with bluJam. And we also ordered the Fries  which came after the meal and we had to remind them obviously they forgot about it too.  I would love to give it a try again if they have the improvements.",0.6597
5-Aug-19,"This place may look cute and aesthetically pleasing, but everything about the food, THE MAIN REASON TO COME TO A RESTAURANT, is by FAR not pleasing. I waited 20 minutes for my meal to come after they served guests who arrived AFTER i did and i was definitely not impressed. My friend ordered the opened faced avocado and ham sandwich which every ingredient looked and tasted like it came from a cheap grocery store that could've been made way better at home. I ordered the smoked salmon omelet which was undercooked and runny, the filling of the omelet was BARELY there, and the mushrooms were definitely undercooked if cooked at all. The organization of this place left me confused on how I was supposed to get a drink or how the food would get to me. This place is extremely overpriced for the cheap and poorly cooked meals that were served. In total the 2 of us spent almost $30, which we couldve BY FAR made better at home for cheaper. Definitely. DEFINITELY. NOTHING i would ever try again!",0.979
4-Aug-19,After seen hot and new on yelp . I know I have to check this place out . Most brunch places in Alhambra are traditional American diner like ihop and Denny's . I highly recommended their egg Benedict and French toast .,0.5563
4-Aug-19,Okay. This place is amazing. I like how the room is really bright and cool atmosphere. I ordered Apple Cinnamon Crepe and I was afraid it might be too sweet. It wasn't as sweet as I thought. Just the right amount of everything. I really like the ice cream too. I recommend you guys to give it a try. I love it there!! Definitely coming back.,0.9841
4-Aug-19,"Lovely ambience casual vibes. My friends and I had Florentine eggs  benedict, house French toasts and ham and cheese omelet. I was told everything made in house and from scratch. Impressive! I been living in Alhambra for a long time, this area definitely lack of good brunch place like this. Staffs were helpful and friendly. I do recommend their Eggs benedict and French toasts. And my friend loves the omelet too. Eggs were cooked to perfect, hash browns were so crunchy and I could taste the freshness out of the fryer. French toasts were my favor, outer layer was so crispy yet inner layer was so soft and chewy. Pairing with right amount of condensed milk and maple syrup. Soooo yummmmm! The multi textures gave me a perfect experience. Plus! Fresh squeezed orange juice!Definitely will come back with bunch friends.",0.9935
3-Aug-19,"Best Brunch in 626 Area. I came with my friends because I saw they just doing soft opening. As a brunch lover, I have to check it out. Popping yolk definitely serve great quality foods. We had 3 fresh orange juice. Norwegian Benedict. Truffle burger ham n cheese omelette. They are all 10/10.Great service great food and nice ambiance",0.9801
3-Aug-19,"The food was good, however 3 stars for the extra long wait to get our food. Ordered at 11:09 at the front desk, my personal order came out at 11:35, and my partners food didn't come out until 11:50am. By the time he got his food, I had already finished eating my eggs Benedict. Idk what was happening, but it's unacceptable to have to wait this long for scrambled eggs, bacon and hash browns.",-0.5023
