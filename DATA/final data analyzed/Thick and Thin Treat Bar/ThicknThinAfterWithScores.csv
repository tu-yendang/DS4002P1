16-Sep-24,the watermelon juice refresher is sensational and my favorite protein shake is the cookies and cream. all must trys!,0.3802
16-Sep-24,"I've been on a smoothie kick and the Watermelon Mint smoothie was the perfect pick for the end of summer. The large was $13 and popped up with a discount for my first purchase. The smoothie itself was tasty and I like that it was well-blended so there weren't chunks of ice. I also like their clear cups, fun marketing extra. Service was okay - I went in pretty early, there was only one person working, and they were in the back before and after making my order. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here specifically, but it's a nice asset to the area and convenient to the gym next door. Bonus points for having outdoor seating!",0.9696
23-Aug-24,I decided to stop on my way out & it was9. She wasn't ready till 10 mins after opening  and she seemed annoyed someone was here at 9 am. Then her regulars come In & her attitude changes with huge smiles .,-0.1306
9-Aug-24,"I just enjoyed a workout next door at IVI Performance and walked into Thick & Thin for a protein shake. The ambiance was aesthetically pleasing and clean! The woman that helped me recommended the Banana & Butter and it did not disappoint. Aside from the protein shakes, all the other treats looked amazing and I cant wait to go back and try more menu items. 10/10!",0.9446
5-Aug-24,"After two years of being a regular, I think it's time that I look for another dessert spot. Aesthetic, the cool merch, and the unique layout were the plus of this place but what you mainly came here was obviously for the dessert. I've noticed that they took out the machines they were using the first year that they opened. I've also noticed that some employees/chefs would be using the kitchen area from Pine Bistro next door (maybe same ownership?) which looked a little weird. However, the quality of the food was very subpar, it used to be so creamy and rich, but it felt like the PB N King I always get, tasted like something I can make at home with my Ninja Blender. I'm a huge fan of supporting small business', especially in our area around Southern Highlands, but please bring back the consistency of your product. Lastly, I just wanted to add about the service. I hate nitpicking service, but it wasn't busy, there was no other customer in sight to be flustered with orders and the usual questions of ""would you like toppings on top?"" ""Is it your first time with us?"" Etc. were something that I loved about this place. Maybe some basic customer service training needs to be reimplemented.",0.9759
4-Aug-24,"What happened Thick & Thin? Whenever I come here, I'll usually get the pink n bow ice cream. I'm attaching 2 photos with my review of apparently the same item. One is from last year and another for current photo from today. As you can plainly see, there's a huge difference. What I got today was basically vanilla ice cream blended with strawberry syrup and a couple chunks of cheesecake bites. No KitKat or sprinkles to be found. I basically paid for an overpriced strawberry sundae. If that's what I wanted, I really could have gotten it anywhere else for much cheaper. I was so disappointed with what I got today, I tossed it in the trash after investigating it and a couple bites. My husband pointed out that their machines that used to make the ice cream weren't there anymore. We noticed that they were using a regular blender instead. I'm pretty sure that's the main reason why it turned out the way it did today, but I'm also certain that they missed putting any KitKats or sprinkles in the blender. Sadly, the service had also taken a hit. They never asked if I wanted toppings like they always have before, and I had to ask for a spoon since there weren't any available with the rest of the utensils at the pick up area.I really don't see myself coming back here unless they got their ice cream blending machines back. It was a big let down since this was the only place I knew nearby that blended their ice cream with toppings and other ingredients for the texture-loving peeps. It was nice knowing the old Thick & Thin.",0.5274
25-Jul-24,"I've been here a few times! I love it here so glad it's in the neighborhood, the girl with the red hair isn't too friendly so it throws off the friendly aesthetic here but will be back bc I love it here nonetheless kudos to the owner design & location choice!",0.9353
17-Jul-24,"I recently visited Thick and Thin and had a 10/10 experience.I decided on the MatchaMama and it was absolutely delicious! The blend was perfectly balanced, refreshing, and packed with flavor. It's the best Matcha smoothie I've had. It was evident that the ingredients were fresh and of high quality.The employee Veronica also ensured that my order was prepared exactly as I wanted, checked in to see if I was enjoying my smoothie, and made sure the entire experience was pleasant and memorable. Her friendly and attentive demeanor truly added to the overall positive experience.Thick and Thin is now my go-to spot for smoothies, thanks to the outstanding service and the fantastic quality of their drinks. I highly recommend!!",0.9937

7-Jul-24,"This chill little shop is beside an apartment complex (nearby SouthPoint casino) with the a few designated parking spots available for Thick&Thin customers. There are a lot of variety in quick and portable snacks, baked goods, merch, and a decent menu selection of drinks and bowls available. My group stopped by for a post-workout smoothie and it hit the spot. We got two mintchip and two PB&jelly protein shakes, which we had no complaints about!",-0.7263
5-Jul-24,I gave this place three tries. The employees are nice but the protein shakes just don't taste great. Tried vegan and regular. I think if they try a different protein brand it maybe better. The after taste from a sip is just not a yummy taste to me.,-0.5195
3-Jul-24,"Came at about 6:30pm on a Wednesday. After ordering (3 shakes) we were told they were out of whole milk and asked for us to pick an alternative. It was out first time here, so I had no idea of the other choices, so the lady making our drinks and I awkwardly stared at each other for a minute, before I asked what the other options were. We settled on almond milk and waited for our shakes. When the first was done, we were then told they ran out of shake cups and bumped us to large cups - that's fine, but another thing out? Weird.. maybe just a fluke first visit, maybe we'll try again another day..",-0.3268
21-Jun-24,"Love the feeling inside this awesome hipster dessert place. Soft serve wasnt too sweet, just right. Be coming back to try other items",0.8085
7-Jun-24,"Ordered on Uber eats and this was advertised as ""Acai Aura"". The açaí bowl was a good size and base had a good flavor. Fruit was ok not very fresh like other açaí places. Had I known this was mainly an ice cream place I wouldn't have ordered an Acai bowl. Uber had an option when customizing to add cocoa nibs and instead I got chocolate chips. With the size of the bowl it was a very small amount of fruit. Probably 5 blueberries, 1-2 strawberries cut up, and MAYBE half a banana. Not worth the prize paid ($23 before Uber tip and fees)",-0.2413
22-May-24,"Had the chance to check out Thick & Thin in June of 2023 thanks to a Yelp Elite event and I've been back quite a few times since. I will say, the service is not great. One time I went when the owner (I think) happened to be there taking inventory, so the two employees were overly enthusiastic in front of him. Other than that 1 time, the employees are never friendly and honestly seem just miserable. Prices are also a bit high. I'm addicted to their Mint Chip protein shake which is $12 for a regular or $16 for a large. Their bottles of fresh juice range from $9-$12. This is 15 mins from my house and the only thing that keeps me as a customer is the fact that everything is extremely fresh and made with quality ingredients. If they could get their staff to be more hospitable, I'd turn a blind eye to the prices and I'd come in more frequently for the friendly staff & great drinks. As it stands though, this is a once every 4-6 week treat for me.",-0.7596
18-May-24,I come frequently to Thick and Thin after my workout at their facility IVI next door. The service is outstanding and the choices are great. The juices are fresh squeezed on the spot and the flavors are excellent. I make it a routine stop almost always.,0.9169
15-May-24,Very friendly staffs and a clean venue with an awesome ambience. Always love getting my favorite sweet treats from here! Highly recommended,0.9715
24-Apr-24,"We came into this establishment in hopes to get a healthy drink. We expected a long wait as there was only one worker and a couple people ahead of us. We however didn't expect to wait 30 minutes for a drink. I want to stress that it isn't the workers fault that the drinks/treats aren't getting out to the customers, but it is a lack of help from higher ups or even ownership. The worker is clearly drowning in a bunch of orders from people that came before and after us. There was no support. Managers came into the establishment two different times and delegated rather than lead by example and get their hands dirty. Ownership should higher more staff or adequate managers to help out. Side note, if someone cancels their order don't just leave it at that. Offer something in return for messing up on your end. We canceled our order and you just let us go, have some kind of managerial adequacy and make it right by the consumer. @stephanie.",0.8337
24-Apr-24,"This is my first time coming and the LAST TIME. I went in at 8:17 pm for a fresh juice. I figured it would take a minute because there's only one guy working. 26 minutes later, still nothing and he is jammed with orders. One guy comes out of no where and helps him wash blenders. Then leaves and says he's going to get his manager, which her name is Stephanie. They take like 5 minutes to come back. The guy brought the manager and goes back to washing dishes and Stephanie comes in and doesn't even help. She's saying hi to people in the store even though there's multiple people waiting for their orders for OVER 30 MINUTES. She probably would've still kept talking to the people in the store if the barista didn't ask her how to refund my debit card.I asked for a refund because I don't want a $14 juice after waiting 30 minutes. Stephanie looks at me while she's refunding me and goes ""So did you never get your drink"" or something along those lines. Like, no DUH I'm standing in front of you with no drink. Left the store at 8:53 with no drink and feeling sorry that their cashier/barista is struggling and has useless support. Hope he doesn't go through that everyday.",-0.0464
7-Mar-24,"Ok, so when my boyfriend and I first started dating, he lived in the apartment complex across the street, where back then Thick & Thin Treats and all these other businesses surrounding them did not exist. He has since moved out of that complex and I recently came back around this area for the first time in almost four years to visit this business. I wanted to go this past Saturday night, but due to the high wind warning that night, I decided to delay my visit to Wednesday night.Thick & Thin Treats is located right on the property of Cactus Hills on Dean Martin. It was a little hard to find them at first because their signage was obstructed by numerous trees from the street and it wasn't very well lit. Here, they have a mix of healthy desserts and sweet desserts. I'm trying to lose weight and stick towards healthier food items, especially with more protein added in, so my eye was on their freshly pressed juices, smoothies, and protein shakes.I walked in and studied the menu, and oh boy, lots and lots of options to choose from! I ended up getting their pink starburst smoothie in a large cup. I was the lone customer there, so my order came out super quickly. The guy working behind the counter was in a great mood - he was pumped and was jamming along to the music playing inside while he was making my smoothie. Man, while this smoothie was thick, it was still super delicious! It tasted like a real strawberry/watermelon starburst candy with little red seeds inside. I had to wait it out a bit so it could be easier for me to drink out of it with a straw (spoons are necessary in this case).They have little swings inside by the entrance that you can sit on while you wait for your order to come out. I thought this was cute. They also have lots of outdoor seating as well for those nice sunny days. Will definitely have to sit outside next time once the weather becomes warmer very soon!If you're looking for a great place with healthy items and sweet items, Thick & Thin Treats is your place. Go check them out!",0.9958
4-Mar-24,"The place has plenty of potential but it's hidden a little off cactus, the ice cream is good but a little of the pricy side but it's really nice and clean inside.  The service wasn't the best but I guess that's the new norm with gen z kids, I hope the owner all the best.",0.7705
27-Feb-24,"Not a good ice cream . Service is poor. I don't recommend. Ice cream was very icy , it didn't taste good",-0.8411
12-Jan-24,"Overall our items tasted great. The açaí bowl was not icy and had a good consistency. The jungle jam smoothie my sister ordered was also very delicious and not too sweet either. My fresh squeezed orange had lots of pulp which I loved and this is not on menu but you can order it, however it was pricy for a small squeezed OJ.The cashier was not too friendly and very short. I did see she was by herself but it was early in the morning so maybe she was tired. The place was decorated nice but I think they should have music playing because the silence felt awkward, and not a lot of seating inside.",0.6205
20-Oct-23,Fabulous options. Great service. An interesting take on treat options. With a wide spectrum of assortments.,0.9169
17-Oct-23,This icecream was very rich snd creamy! Definitely a sharing size. The inside was very cute and clean. A little on the pricier end though,0.9427
9-Aug-23,"Ambiance - 5 stars! This place is located in a quiet and clean complex next to new apartment buildings. There were designated areas for customers to park which was convenient and close to the shop. Inside, you are greeted with colorful wallpaper, cute merchandise, and a variety of protein-packed snacks to purchase.Service - 5 stars! I was welcomed in immediately and loved that recommendations were made since this was my first time visiting. There was only one employee working, but she took my order and was able to get me my drink quickly.Food - 3 stars. I ordered the 12 oz cookies and cream protein shake. The flavor of the drink was not bad, but I think the flavor could have been stronger. I paid about $14-$15 total for my order. This was a little more than what I'm used to paying for this type of item, but I understand that whey protein is expensive these days, and that this needs to be accounted for. Overall, very cute place and worth a visit if you're in the area.",0.9618
5-Aug-23,"I visited here two months ago for a Yelp Elite Event. I got the green goddess fresh pressed juice, because I am currently gf, dairy, egg, nut, and soy free . It was delicious! Fast forward to today my friends and I went to go see a movie at South Point. Thick & Thin was less than 5 mins away so we decided it would be the perfect treat on a hot night before the movie. I ordered ahead (which I recommend doing) so when we arrived so we didn't have to wait for each of our items to be made. I of course got the green goddess again & my husband got the mint & thin.Super cute business & I love that they have designated parking for their customers so you never have to stress about finding parking. The prices are a little high for what you get in my opinion, but for a treat once in awhile it is worth it! Especially since I am on this diet and there are not many places I can get something at.",0.9678
26-Jul-23,Aesthetically pleasing. Having healthy and not so healthy choices is always a plus. :),0.8957
19-Jul-23,"Eh, not really impressed with the shake and smoothie flavors we tried. My daughter tried the Pink Starburst (and I snagged a sip) - she said there was ""no burst in flavor"" and I'd agree.  I ordered the protein shake Banana and Butter (it was overall bland with a weird aftertaste of whey/protein powder). The ingredients sounded pretty good and names were creative, but outcome didn't deliver the much anticipated result. It's a clean place and tucked away - a good, quick spot for those living nearby.",0.863
16-Jul-23,"** the owner replied and said more employees came at 3pm. Another employee while I was there came in to get some ice said a few words to his coworker and walked out. I do not buy the owners reply.  If that's the case the owner should have came in!**so a trainer can go behind the counter and get ice ask the employee if they need help and say ""call me if you need anything ""?  My second review is based solely on the fact that they had one person working today and the cashier took my order at 11:39am and I finally got it at 1:20pm. Unacceptable !  The people prior to me said they waited one hour. The lady after me and a couple ordered their stuff, the couple cancelled and the lady who just ordered a milkshake is still waiting. I ordered the Detox Juice pack. $67.87 with tip.  Do better Thick &Thin. It wasn't the cashiers fault they just scheduled him for today",0.5334
9-Jul-23,Awesome milkshakes and awesome service! The 2 young men working were helpful and attentive.  Will definitely be back!,0.9358
5-Jul-23,As in my previous review the food and drink were delicious. This time the wait was a lot better. Very happy with this spot excellent all the way around no complaints,0.8858
5-Jul-23,"Did I visit Thick & Thin Treats three times in one week cuz now I'm hooked and I can't get enough? Yup. This spot has become my newest obsession.Was introduced to this business from an Elite Experience and have visited twice now since! I ordered the mint chocolate protein shake the first time, and now I legit have gotten it every single time I have gone. Again... three times in one week.... I don't think I've ever done that for a single business before. It's seriously the tastiest protein shake I've ever had.This location is in a cool spot. I envy the apartment complex in the same parking lot. I would be walking here every day if I was right there. The nice thing is is that this spot isn't suuuuper far from my house (just about a 15 minute drive), which is another reason why I've been a frequent visitor. They also have a rewards point system... SCORE!The inside is beautiful and they have some other treats that they sell. The entire premise of this place is that you can get ice cream or something healthy if you want. Love that! I haven't had the ice cream yet, but I think I'll try it the next time I go. The one gripe I had is the pricing. It's a been pricey, but I honestly don't mind too much because the protein shake in my opinion replaced a meal for me, so I was good to go with it! The employees are also so nice, too! Again, so delish, and if I can get myself to order something other than the mint chocolate protein shake, I will. Don't sleep on this place!",0.9589
2-Jul-23,"Me and boyfriend visited thick and thin treats on a Tuesday afternoon. It's located off of Cactus and 15 in the same parking lot as a gym and apartment complex. They have both healthy and extra yummy options. You can do ice cream, smoothies, açai bowls, or coffee. The service was good and the workers were very nice. The place is very cute and clean and good places to take pictures. I had a build your own with a vanilla base, captain crunch, Reese's, and chocolate syrup. They didn't have dairy free options for the base so I took a lactose pill and opted out for whip cream on top. My boyfriend had an Affogato, espresso with ice cream. Both out treats were tasty and we enjoyed our little dessert date!",0.9717
30-Jun-23,"They offer an assortment of beverages and ice cream. They have protein shakes, pressed  juice smoothies and other treats. The place is cute, trendy, and clean. The service was good. It's more of a grab and go place, not a lot of sitting  options available unless you sit outside",0.8225
27-Jun-23,"Had the chance to attend my very first Yelp Elite experience. Loved the fresh pressed juice smell from the moment I walked in. The menu has an excellent variety of sweet treats and juices. Only got the chance to try the Berry Blaster Protein Shake today, but looking forward to trying one of their other items in the future.",0.7964
27-Jun-23,"Well this little gem is well hidden and seems like in the middle of nowhere. It's nestled on Dean Martin just south of Cactus in a small little complex next to some new apartments. I'm secretly glad I don't live there or else Thick n Thin Treats may take all of my money!I brought my son with promises of ice cream and it was perfect because it was nearly 97 when we showed up after 4pm on 6/26. It was empty so we were able to ask questions and inquire favorites, flavor profiles and such. They were super friendly and helpful!My son decided on the Orange N Dream ice cream and since he was craving Dole Whip, they said they could add some pineapple into it. I had narrowed it down between Pink Starburst and Gummy Bear smoothie and was gently coerced into getting the Gummy Bear.We sat on the fun set of swings for a bit and then walked over to watch them make our items. They have a drill machine similar to Drill It Creamery and they threw in vanilla ice cream, orange sherbet, some pineapple, and some cornflakes. It was a nice tall tower that was then topped with whipped cream, which made my son super happy.The Gummy Bear was blended and looking good. As my son said, he was jealous I got a souvenir cup lol. The Orange N Dream was definitely like a creamsicle with tiny bits of ice cream cone (imagine texture). We both really liked it but on the way home my son did state that next time he would definitely ask for it without. We couldn't truly taste much of the pineapple but we appreciated the efforts to try and make it a custom flavor. The Gummy Bear smoothie was thick and flavorful: mango lemon, raspberry, and orange sherbet, peach juice, apple juice, and milk. Overall we were happy with this new little local shoppe. There are definitely many items we would like to try in the future. Just be aware that unless you like a little crunch in your ice cream, you may want to read the fine print or ask for it without.",0.9946
25-Jun-23,"Friendly staff. Staff the knowledgeable of the menu. Tried the build your own milkshake (vanilla ice cream, Oreo cookies, walnuts, and cheesecake bites. It comes with a whipped cream topping. The cup it was served in felt like it could be reused for other fun beverages.",0.8402
25-Jun-23,"The location is located in a apartment complex parking area in a small discreet suite. Thick and Thin Treats has a nice selection of healthy and indulgent treats. Walking in, the decor was vibrant and welcoming. The individual who helped us was very kind and helpful, very good service. I opted for the Green Goddess for the Elite event for my wife and I purchased the Hazelnut Freeze for myself. The green Goddess juice was fresh. We watched as the fresh fruits were freshly juiced and are done so per order so you won't be receiving juice that has been sitting. The hazelnut Freeze was just right for me! Most other chain coffee places saturate their drinks full of sugar and syrups that you can't even taste your coffee. This was very delightful, perfect amount of sweetness! I also found it helpful that they offered ice cream of you're feeling a little indulgent.",0.9913

24-Jun-23,"I was so excited to try this place out once I saw their menu go by! It was nice to finally have a place where my boyfriend could get a healthy protein shake and I could get the complete opposite in a not as healthy milkshake. Most importantly, they are DOG FRIENDLY!Location wise, it's right off the 15&Cactus so you can't be that. It's in a new little area but there is plenty of parking. They have seating inside but there is also some outdoor as well. The inside is decorated simply and the menu is so easy to understand their options. It is a quiet area which made it nice as well since we had our dog with us. Since this was our first time, we did have a few questions and our cashier (Remington I believe) was awesome. He helped guide us through all of the different things we ordered by explaining alternatives and substitutions along the way. My boyfriend had the cookies and cream protein shake and I even had a sip and you wouldn't have known it was healthy because it was so good. I have the TNT Açaí bowl and it was refreshing on a Vegas day. I also had to have a milkshake and went for the one that included the most chocolate and it too was delicious. They do offer pup cups as well!Overall, such a great spot and so glad we went to try it out!",0.9952
21-Jun-23,"My family went and we all loved it! We got Brownn' Bomb Icecream, Paradise Passion Smoothie and a PN' B King Icecream. Everything was fresh and tasty.

There are so many options to choose from and we will for sure be trying it again.",0.9906
21-Jun-23,"Came here for the 1st time! It's right off freeway, so it's super convenient to get to! There aren't that many parking spots, as this is right next to an apartment building. But they do have 15 min spots right in front It's VERY cute inside ! Lots of great naturally lighting. Great for pics ! The menu is large but there's something for everyone here. I got a juice because I need the immune boost! Next time will definitely do a smoothie or ice cream. So many items looks delicious! Staff was sweet and offered insight!",0.9921
11-Jun-23,"This place hit the mark! I've been CRAVING fruity pebbles for months ... I happened to be in Vegas and came across this place thanks to Yelp and they offered fruity pebbles. So we took the drive over and the place was empty, the staff was quick to take our orders, and while it may have taken a little bit because we place 1 ice cream and 3 juice orders it was worth the wait. As we waited so many people came in! I ordered the vanilla with fruit pebbles, mini marshmallows, and sprinkles. The size felt so large and I ate almost every ounce of it! Take a chance and check this place out, cool concept to make your own or use their menu!",0.816

4-Jun-23,The service was terrible. There was a girl walking back and forth just changing her gloves and not helping at all. We waited over half an hour for our small order and then found out there was a lady that ordered before us and hadn't gotten her drink. I ordered a mocha and got vanilla which I specifically told them I didn't want. The employees had no communication skills. Too bad. It was a cute place but very frustrating.,-0.8292
4-Jun-23,"I don't like giving out bad reviews, but I'm pretty annoyed I waited 30 minutes for my single order of ice cream and the family that ordered after me received their order first. I won't be back which is unfortunate because I really do like their smoothies.",-0.8437

They're unique blends for sure, but not what I was hoping for. Next time, I think I'll try an acai bowl. Side note: They have really cute merch!",0.9409
23-May-23,"This shop is SO cute! It is located right by the kactus (sp?) apartments, so a little tricky to find the first time. They have ice cream, shakes, smoothies, wellness shots, coffee and cereal bowls. We got a gummy bear smoothie (YUM) and cookies n cream ice cream. My daughter said it's the best cookies and cream she's ever had! I agree. The interior is decorated simplistically, but with an awesome artsy vibe. They also have super cute merch and snacks that are sold up front. We will 100% return and I hope this place gets more exposure because they deserve to be in business!",0.9846

9-Apr-23,"This cute little hidden gem has a lot to offer when it comes to flavor. My husband picked up a cookies and cream protein shake and it melted in your mouth and tasted like ice cream. It was absolutely delicious! I went with a beet juice, it was very earthy just like beets should taste, the juice consistency was perfection with no chunks but not overly runny. The person helping us was very friendly and knowledgeable, this little shop was on the pricey side but for us, we'll definitely be back!",0.9588
