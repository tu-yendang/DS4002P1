17-Sep-24,"Of any food one could try in Manhattan, a slice of New York pizza is always at the top of everyone's list. And with a large variety of places scattered throughout the entirety of Manhattan, choosing a place to try has always been a challenge for most people. As a visitor to the area, I wasn't sure myself on what place would represent the pizza in New York the best. So when a friend recommended me to try Joe's Pizza a few blocks away from Times Square, I figured I'd take their suggestion and see what the big commotion is about.Arriving at Joe's Pizza for the first time, I was not aware that this spot was popular for its cameo in Spiderman and for the amount of famous individuals that have stopped by to try their pizza. So when I saw the line stretching around the block on a Wednesday night around 8:00PM, I was astonished for sure! Even though the line was long, I knew I had to get my hands on a few slices. And boy I am sure glad I did. The line did seem to be very long at first, yes. But after getting into the madness, I was in the restaurant in the a matter of 10 minutes. Taking a look inside, the restaurant was quite small with a few tables and chairs to stand at. But for the most part, people were taking their pizzas to go. For this experience, I was able to try slices of their Pepperoni Pizza (Slice is $5.50, Pie is $31.00) as well as their Supreme Pizza (Slice is $6.50, Pie is $35.00).First things first, do not underestimate the size a slice truly is. I ordered two slices of Supreme Pizza in addition to a whole pie to split. And with what I would consider a larger appetite than most people, I was full after three slices. For most, a slice or two will be more than filling. Now looking at a slice of each, the pepperoni pizza had plenty of pepperoni pieces on the top which was more than worth it for $5.50 price tag. And as for the Supreme Pizza, each slice came with a balanced helping of pepperoni, Italian sausage, crisp red onions, and mushrooms; this was also definitely worth it for a dollar more. For a minimum of $4.50 a slice, the price to portion ratio is more than great: It's a steal!The taste of the pizza was one of the best I've ever had....anywhere. Other than the greasiness of the slices, each component was delicious and I never felt that Joe's was overrated in any way. Beginning with the bread, the dough was soft and easily chewable while the crust was perfectly salted and perfectly crisp. The cheese pulled very easily as the pizza was fresh out of the oven and was very cheesy, so much so that the layer of cheese on the pizza came off the slice when pulled hard enough. The marinara sauce on the pizza was more muted compared to other slices I've had in the past. But to that end, the marinara was still present and contributed a light sweetness to the food. Every topping put on after that allowed the flavor of the pizza a new personality. And with that, there wasn't a single bad topping. Starting with the pepperoni, I enjoyed the balance of spice and zest each slice had. Mixed with the marinara sauce, a sweetness was brought to the surface. The red onions were baked to their caramelization point which made them taste like the skin of a red apple. In other words: very delicious! For next, the mushrooms were pretty standard and exactly how you would imagine them tasting on a pizza. But in addition, their texture blended in with the pizza to add some chew onto the cheesiness. For last, the sausage was very mild in spice which made it taste closer to the meat of a hot dog. But because of this muted flavor, each of the foundational components were highlighted.Joe's Pizza has mastered their basics and have crafted what I would say is one of the best pizzas in the country, no question. But even with this, Joe's has a variety of other toppings that showcase their mastery of the New York Pie and add personality for the city's diverse cravings. The price for a slice or an entire pie is well worth it for any budget which makes Joe's very accessible to all. If you are comfortable waiting in line for a bite to eat, Joe's is definitely a solid choice and earns a solid 5/5 stars in my book. If in doubt, look at the amount of people lining up to give their slices a try. There is a reason everybody comes by and keeps coming back for more! Great pizza, Joe's!",0.9992
17-Sep-24,"I visited this iconic pizza spot before heading to a Broadway show and it did not disappoint! We arrived around 6 pm, and even then, a line was already starting to form. It wasn't too long at first, but by the time we got near the door, it had really stretched, a testament to just how beloved this pizza joint is.The establishment itself is quite small, and inside, people were packed like sardines, eagerly enjoying their pizza. Some were even standing just to experience eating in such an iconic space. Thankfully, there's some seating outside, and we managed to snag a spot. However, don't expect to linger after finishing your meal... it's a quick in-and-out type of place.I opted for the Supreme Pizza, while others in my group got pepperoni, cheese, and Caprese pizzas. I only had one slice, but it was more than enough to fill me up for a few hours. The Supreme was delicious, and I'm glad I tried something different, but in all honesty, I still prefer the pepperoni, which is their signature. There's something about its simplicity that just hits the spot every time.This was my second time visiting, and I can confidently say it's a must-visit for anyone wanting a classic New York pizza experience. Just make sure you have some extra time on hand because the line tends to get long (we were here for about 45 mins). The service was solid, the prices are definitely for the people, and the pizza? Absolutely one of the best pizzas I've had!",0.9971
16-Sep-24,"I love this Joe's pizza location. It's located on the way to my office. So I can just grab a pizza and take back to home. A lot of customers can be expected during weekend. But the waiting line normally moves pretty fast. My recommendation is whole pie cause it's at better value than slice. But if you can't finish, get a slice of meat lover and you will fell full immediately. There are a lot of other attractions nearby so it's also a good place to spent some time during weekend.",0.9818
16-Sep-24,"I ordered a box of pepperoni pizza to go, so I can't comment on the service, ambiance, or wait times. Maybe because I ordered it for delivery my experience was different, but I thought the pizza was mediocre. The pepperoni slices were way too salty for my standard.Next time, I'll go to the store to try the margarita pizza fresh out of the oven-- maybe that will make me understand the big hype around this place!",0.501
15-Sep-24,"Supposedly Joe's pizza is a mecca of time square new york! This is definitely a bucket list to do. Iconic pizzeria to just try out. Spiderman the movie was filmed here.Stood in line for 30 mins just to get in. The line went all the way to the end of the block. Finally got inside and ordered a Large Pizza. This is a NO NO! If you are ordering an entire pizza, you will be waiting a long time!! You have to buy it by the slice. We waited another 30 mins because they would just put you to the side and practically forget about you. This establishment makes bank! $$ it's always full.   I would do it once. Pizza tasted like Valentinos pizza in California Manhattan Beach lol. Don't get me wrong, it's good but only good to stay in line once.  :) Seating is vary hard to get! Make sure you use a buddy system to wait for seating.   Cool place.",0.9452
14-Sep-24,I needed to find the best pizza in New York so after doing some research I came across Joe's pizza. I was only in New York for the weekend but I definitely came back for another slice it was that good.  line was about a 5-10 min wait both times I went but it was worth the wait.,0.9072
13-Sep-24,"Joes is a classic place to get a slice, great atmosphere, great people, quick and easy, finally it's reasonably priced for the quality. The cheese is a classic cheese slice, nothing to complain about. The pepperoni was amazing, Flavorful pepperonis, stretchy cheese, amazing sauce. Joes does it very well.",0.9726
11-Sep-24,"It didn't click at first why Joe's Pizza looked so familiar, but then I realized this is where Peter Parker worked as a delivery driver in Spider-Man! Don't let the long line scare you off--this spot is a local favorite for good reason. Trust me, the line moves quickly, and when it's your turn, you might as well grab a whole pie. The supreme was easily our favorite!""",0.9649
8-Sep-24,Great NYC style pizza.  Worth the wait.  There was a huge line when I went but I glad I waited.,0.8248
7-Sep-24,"NYC pizza staple... we had pie at Times Square and East Village locations.  Both were very good.  I got Supreme (Sausage/Roni) and Cheese.  Cheese is really good.  Tables have shakers to spice, season and cheese it up.  If the line is long, you can order pie at register directly which is about 15min wait. Line can be 30 minutes at Times Square location.",0.8898
7-Sep-24,"mid pizza. recommended by a few of my friends and i had really high hopes, especially since the line was out the door and around the corner! it was a thin crust, baked slightly too long, felt like eating chips. we got a cheese (half the pizza was cheese and the rest was a crispy crust....), pepperoni, and the caprese. nothing special in my opinion and didn't satisfy my pizza craving. even though they have lots of celebrity photos on their wall, i think it's just a tourist trap. just visit, and see for yourself.",0.5765
4-Sep-24,"35 minute line on a Wednesday evening, but it is Times Square, what can ya doWorth the wait though, got a caprese pizza and they stick it back in the oven to heat up before handing it to you. They do take card (there's another Joe's location in West Village that is cash only)Pizza is crispy and the tomato sauce is amazing (I strongly dislike floppy pizza)",0.6652
2-Sep-24,Update: 45 minutes late and this is how the pizza looked upon arrival. I regret this entire order and leaving a tip My pizza never arrived. I called the restaurant. They said they can't reach the driver. I asked for a refund and they said there's nothing they could do.,-0.4356
2-Sep-24,It is always busy here. There is always a line outside of this place. But the line moves fast. I tried their cheese pizza (highly recommended by friends). It tastes good but not amazing. It is just pizza.,0.2363
2-Sep-24,"It didn't hit me right away why Joe's Pizza look familiar but then I remember this is where Peter Parker worked as a delivery driver in Spider-Man! Don't let the extremely long line turn you off. This is a local favorite for a reason. Trust me, the line will move and when you're up there, you might as well just get a whole pie. The supreme was by fair our favorite.",0.9757
1-Sep-24,"Before visiting NYC, I was always told to visit Joe's Pizza and luckily there was plenty of them around the city. This particular spot was 10 minutes from the hotel so we had to stop by for dinner! Line was expectedly long and midway, we realized that ordering it online was faster than standing in line so we ordered it through the website and it was done within 10 minutes. I'm usually not a fan of thin crusted pizzas but it was pretty good. My husband absolutely loved it and basically ate the whole box - mind you, my brother, husband and I were sharing one box! The shop itself is small, very limited seating/tables but people are usually in and out that you'll be able to catch one! Food and service is great, pizza is made right in front of you so you know everything is fresh. It's a long wait but definitely worth it!",0.9868
1-Sep-24,Tried this famous pizza place and there was a long line at around 6pm. The line was going around the corner. We waited for at least 30 mins!Keep in mind that store is very small so limited space to eat there. We ordered the cheese and pepperoni pizza slice to try. Honestly nothing special at all. It's good to try them out but I definitely don't think it worth the hype and wait.,0.5029
1-Sep-24,I never miss visiting Joe's anytime I am in NY. Best pizza ever!! A must do when in NYC.,0.7374
31-Aug-24,"On my trip to NYC, I definitely wanted to try Joe's Pizza and that's what I did. I waited in a very long line that formed in front of the restaurant because apparently there were many people like me who wanted to try the famous pizza. It was worth the wait because it was very, very good",0.8615
31-Aug-24,"Joe's Pizza is a New York staple, and it's one of my favorites! The crust is truly exceptional--perfectly crispy with just the right amount of chew. The pizza is on the thinner side, which I really enjoy. It's a classic New York-style slice done right. While there are a few tables if you prefer to dine in, the service is so quick that you're usually in and out within 5-10 minutes. I personally prefer to take mine to go.",0.8585
28-Aug-24,"First of all - when your New York native Uber driver gives you a recommendation - take it! He recommended Joe's because I was looking for authentic New York pizza. I ordered the two topping pie - it was incredible! It arrived piping hot, and I must say IT IS HUGE! Perfect topping to crust ratio. Wasn't greasy but just perfect in every way! Even my husband who isn't big on pizza ate it! Definitely big enough for 3-4 people at a price that isn't known to NYC.",0.9386
28-Aug-24,"I had the supreme pizza. The wait was way too long, and the pizza was pretty underwhelming. Other Joe's locations have been better.",0.8658
27-Aug-24,"This is 2 Bros pizza in quality.  If you want a real NYC slice, this isn't it.  This is a tourist pizza.  The pizza lacked acidity, the sauce was sweet and not tangy at all.  The dough has no flavor at all and the bite was really lacking.  The cheese they use is too dry and lack any cheese flavor.  The dough was like a dry cracker that cracked and no seasoning at all.  Really poor quality NY pizza.",-0.5095
27-Aug-24,Long line waits for no reason. They have a bunch of pictures on the walls of celebrities that come by but it's not worth the wait. Plenty of other good spots you can visit for pizza.,0.3074
26-Aug-24,Overrated finally gave joes a Try because the l line was short. Don't understand the hype the pizzas sauce was plain and didn't taste like it had any seasoning. the only good thing was the crunch of the crust but overall why over priced and way over hyped.,0.1015
26-Aug-24,We ordered a cheese pizza for pickup on DoorDash since both nights we walked by there was always a massive line. Our order was ready almost immediately after placing the order. It was clear that the pie was premade and sitting above the oven to stay warm. By the time we got back to our hotel to eat the pizza was completely cold. The crust was also very hard and not edible. No plates/napkins were included even though I believe I asked for those when I ordered on DoorDash. Definitely feels like a tourist trap and not worth the hype. Maybe it would've been better fresh ‍.,0.9123
26-Aug-24,"I'm a Chicago native and not a huge fan of NY style pizza but I was in full tourist mode and wanted to check out all the top spots. The line was long as expected, and it took me about 25 minutes to go through it. They have a good system going and it moves quickly. I just went simple and got a slice of cheese pizza. I ordered my slice and then had to wait a couple of minutes because they throw it back in the oven to heat heat it up. You pay while you're waiting. I paid cash and it was $4.50.Since it was just me, I was able to snag a barstool and eat my pizza at the front window while people watching. It's very busy inside and it's a very small space with limited seating so I ate and left quickly so someone else could have my seat. The pizza was cool. Hot and crispy. Not a huge fan, but it was more about the experience for me. I'm glad I get to check it off the list.",0.6372
25-Aug-24,This shit slaps and I've got it in my mouth right fuckin now. Plain pie. Chewy crispy crust. Fuckin flavorful ass sauce. And don't even get me started on the fuckin cheese,-0.7964
25-Aug-24,"You know when the line is long and predominantly locals that Joe's is the go to place for a true NY Slice or pie!  From the hotel concierge to along line that moved rather well, everyone said ""new York isfMous for pizza and Joe's is where New York goes for pizza!""You will not be disappointed!  Not like at Carmine's -see my separate review.",0.7367
24-Aug-24,It's alright. Gets a lot of traffic and praise due to its legacy and name but it's not the best pizza you can get in NY.,-0.4122
23-Aug-24,"Our go-to New York style pizza while in NYC for 3 weeks. We tried a couple other well-reviewed pizza joints while there but this was the winner with the kids-- they'd literally cheer when we would get Joe's lol. Their ingredients seem a nitch above their competition too. I don't know whst kinds of gourmands I'm raising but the kids Joe's uses better cheese. I guess maybe most kids might be pizza aficionados! The location we patronized was always busy, always a line out the door. At first I was skeptical that it was a tourist trap, but now I'm a full convert and its reputation seems warranted. The cashier is efficient and keeps the line moving. If you plan to not eat there, save yourself gobs of time and preorder online or via app! I couldn't figure out how to place an order online (prolly cuz I'm old lol) but ordered a couple times via the Yelp app (!) and it saved time and I was able to bypass the horrifying line, waltz in there, and pick up and go. They have a decent amount of seating inside and spillover outdoors but not really great atmosphere-- there's nothing wrong with it but not really inviting as a nice sit-down vibe. Very touristy but highly recommend for great NYC pizza using good ingredients.",0.9408
20-Aug-24,"Not bad. Overdone for my taste, which made the crust require herculean strength just to separate slices. If it were a bit less well done it might've made a huge difference, but as it is it's probably a one and done for me.",0.6222
16-Aug-24,"This pizza is obscene.  The crust is crispy and oh so good.  I just tried their spinach pizza and it was the best I've ever had.  I walked over before opening, and there was already 10 people ahead of me.   I would highly recommend this place.",0.7866
15-Aug-24,"Great NY style classic pizza!Food is simple easy and fastreally loved the pepperoni, not so much the cheese but.",0.7385
15-Aug-24,i liked the fast service and the fact that this place is open late (amazing for a late night out!) but the pizza itself didn't amaze me - tasted like an average ny pizza. wish that the cheese was more melted,0.639
14-Aug-24,"Absolutely not worth the wait around the block and the hype. The pizza was underwhelming and really nothing special. I would say that the crust is thin and crispy, which was nice but other than that, disappointing. Extremely oily and pretty salty with the pepperoni slice. The lack of tomato sauce and excessive oil did not mesh well. Seems like a marketing and tourist trap. I probably wouldn't come here again even if there wasn't a wait.",-0.6971
14-Aug-24,"I recently tried Joy's Pizza, and I must say, it's easily the best pizza I've had in a long time! The crust is perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, striking that ideal balance that can be so hard to find. The sauce has just the right amount of tanginess, complementing the fresh, high-quality toppings.",0.9425
14-Aug-24,"I got there during lunch so the line was a little long but moved, I waited 20-30 minutes to finally order. The line was mostly tourists but some locals from Nearby office buildings, and it was a pleasant experience as everyone waiting in line was very friendly. A lot of families also made up the line. The pizza was ok It was flavorful much better than the $1.50 or $.99 slice pizzerias that are popping up all over the place. Still a little pricey for a slice here at Joe's but worth the wait compared to what's around that Times Square area. There were seating areas inside and outside if you wanted to eat your slice there, they had boxes if you were taking the pizzas to go. If you're in Times Square stop in and have a slice, you never know "" Hey Mikey he likes it.""",0.9642
12-Aug-24,"This will always be my favorite place to grab a slice of za' whenever I'm in NYC. It been consistent and delicious-o-so! I even convert my husband a hardcore Italian who grew up in CT to say it's his favorite too! The sauce is tangy and fresh and flavorful. The crust is what every pizza crust dream of being; immaculate: the gold standard! If your not a crust guy, joes will make you a crust believer! The pizza not overly greasy either and has just the right ratio of toppings and foldablity! Chefffff kisssss yalll! Worth the hype and wait!!!!",0.9075
10-Aug-24,This place was very good. I was going to give it 4 and a half  stars but it would not let me. Pepperoni was excellent.,0.799
10-Aug-24,One of my favorite pizza places.  Worth the wait.  Pizza was piping hot and the red sauce and cheese are legit.,0.5994
9-Aug-24,"The pizza here is exceptional. The crust strikes a perfect balance between crispy and chewy, with a satisfying crunch that holds up well against the generous toppings. The tomato sauce is tangy and rich, harmoniously blending with the gooey mozzarella cheese. The slices are generously topped, but not overloaded, allowing each ingredient to shine.The pepperoni slice is a standout - the pepperoni is perfectly crisped, and its savory spice adds an extra layer of flavor to the pizza. For those who prefer a classic cheese slice, Joe's delivers a traditional New York-style experience with a simple, yet delicious, combination of cheese and sauce.Service is quick and friendly, making it a great spot for a casual bite. Prices are reasonable, especially given the quality of the food. Whether you're a local or just passing through, Joe's Pizza is a must-visit for anyone craving an authentic New York slice.",0.9877
6-Aug-24,"Long lines mean good food. Yes this is one of the most popular pizza places in the city. My thoughts? The crust was excellent with the right amount of chewy to crunchy ratio, the sauce is some of the best I have had on any pizza. The cheese was good, but was a little thin, could have used a bit more. Overall a great NYC slice.",0.9502
5-Aug-24,"Ofc one of our stops in ny had to be joes pizza, the line was down the block but it moved really quickly we probably waited like 15/20 min and were inside the building already. Inside they had pictures of all the celebrities they had come try joe's. They are super packed inside so you have to scream at the person taking your order lol, we got the capresse pizza, white, and plain cheese. The crust on these pizzas were amazing and so crunchy, my favorite was the caprese because of the fresh tomatoes and the mozzarella. Overall would recommend 9/10. Definitely a must try when i. NY",0.9815
1-Aug-24,This pizza place is famous for their pizzas. My 2nd time around and it's always packed. A huge line every time I walk by the area. Rain or shine. The pizza are tasteful. Prices are $4.50 for plain and $5 and up for the difference kinda of meets veg and cheeses. It's worth it. I've been lucky enough to wait on line no more than 5 minutes. But yes the line forms around the corner no matter what. I just been lucky. No parking,0.6369
1-Aug-24,The line to get in and order was pretty insane but I knew that was a good sign - it was well worth the wait! The line moved quite fast. The staff were friendly and efficient but didn't make you feel rushed. Seating was hard to come by inside but they had covered seating off the sidewalk outside as well. I only ordered a cheese slice - which was delicious - but their other options looked (and smelled) amazing as well. Maybe next time I'll try something new - I'll definitely be back!,0.9892
1-Aug-24,"Joe's Pizza is hands down the best pizza in New York! My family and I loved this place! This place is always busy, but omg is the wait worth it! If you ever go to NY, don't forget to stop by Joe's. We're glad we have some locations here in Los Angeles, but it's nothing compared to NY.",0.9393
31-Jul-24,"My first thought while approaching the iconic Joe's Pizza was ""I sure hope it's worth the hype and wait."" The line wrapped around the block and I waited about 40 minutes to get through it. But once I took a bite of the pizza, I quickly understood the wait! The pizza is excellent, with the perfect balance of cheese and crust. The slices are huge, they extend beyond the barriers of an entire plate, so the price feels justified. Some Yelpers complain about the cost, which leaves me eager to explore more of what NYC's pizza scene has to offer--because Joe's really delivered excellence at a good portion and fair price!Although there weren't many places to sit inside, they had a nice little area in front of the building to enjoy your pizza.Overall, a great addition to the NYC experience!",0.9943
30-Jul-24,"This is supposed to be the""go to"" spot and we came by here last time and the lines are out the door, it's in Times square with LOTS of sketchy people and LOTS of pot smoking, so be aware of your surroundings if you venture here. Good thin crust NY style pizza very plain and traditional. I'm my honest opinion I think it's more hype than quality but that's me I'm pretty critical on pizza, not saying it's bad, but for me it's just not outstanding.",0.5987
30-Jul-24,The pizza was everything I hoped a slice of New York pizza would be. The inside is super tiny but there's a window facing bar that I had the pleasure to sit at and it was great for people watching. Service was quick and to the point.,0.9428
28-Jul-24,Nothing like crispy hot huge pepperoni slices and a cold coke.  Cool ambience and really quick service.,0.3591
26-Jul-24,7/10 pizza because it's not as good as the west village location. It was very thin and floppy.,-0.3412

24-Jul-24,I had one of the best pizzas of my life. I am vegetarian so I ordered cheese pizza. It was tasty and I miss this place whenever I have pizza after visiting here! One of the gems! Highly recommend!,0.8057
21-Jul-24,Favorite pizza spots if you enjoy flat crust and crispy bottoms. Could use more dense toppings but I love a crispy crust!,0.8805
19-Jul-24,"The hype is real! This place is famous for its NY pizza by the slice or the whole! It's been featured in movies and is a tiny joint with a casual fast food atmosphere in busy Times Square area, and the lines are out the door, but worth waiting for because it was sooo good! I had the caprese with perfectly gooey mozzarella and fresh basil leaves on a thin crust, while my man went for the plain cheese and wanted to eat it like a local - folded!",0.9673
18-Jul-24,we waited for about half an hour to try joe's pizza but the line moved really fast. we ordered a classic cheese slice and a supreme slice (aka meat lovers). i absolutely love the slightly smoky thin crust here but the flavors here are pretty typical. the slices are on the more expensive side but that's typical touristy new york for you hahaha. i think other places downtown would be a better bang for your buck but this is pretty great regardless!,0.9902
18-Jul-24,"We had Joe's pizza about 2 years ago and we love it. came back to NY again 7/17/24 couldn't wait to have Joe's pizza again but we were so disappointed the pizza was very dry and burnt and the delivery driver didn't have napkins,cheese or peppers and most of all he was very rude. He was begging or asking for a tip before he even  pulled the pizza out and handed it to me. I almost felt like if I didn't give him a tip I wasn't going to get my pizza. Very disappointed",-0.9183
16-Jul-24,"I love this place. Always had a thing for Chicago pizza but it's something about thin crust as I get older that makes a lot of sense for me healthwise. Also, the fact that you can taste the oils and the seasonings and spices make this place unforgettable.",0.3818
13-Jul-24,"The best pizza I've ever had, without a doubt.Sure there's long lines and the pizza isn't cheap, but it's absolutely worth it. The line moves quick and the pizza is seasoned, topped, and cooked to perfection. There's plenty of outdoor seating as well. So many people say this is a tourist trap. It would be if it wasn't so damn good. I've been here 5 times and will go back every time.",0.8882
12-Jul-24,I need joes pizza to come to my state. They know how to make a pretty good pizza. Yes the line is long but service is quick. They have a decent amount of seating inside and outside. I try to come here every time I'm in NY because it's just so good.,0.8294
11-Jul-24,"The pizza is good, very tasty, is it the best , no , I think there are better pizzas but this one is very good nonetheless. The line moves fast, the workers got it down to a science considering how insanely busy this place is , not many places to sit but eating a slice of good pizza on the streets of New York is a great experience overall and one I enjoyed  .",0.9741
11-Jul-24,great pizza and lives up to the hype! the crust was thin and delectable. tried 3 different flavors and each had their own unique profiles. would recommend if you're ok with waiting.,0.9184
10-Jul-24,I had joes pizza! It's edible but it's nothing to go crazy over. I stood in a like for like 30 minutes for a cheese and pepperoni slice! The pepperoni was good but the cheese was average at best. It's not worth the 30 minute wait when there's other pizza spots that's just as good like VITO ICES ABD SLICES ON 36 and 9th! It's busy still just not 30 minutes busy. TikTok them,0.9792
8-Jul-24,"Joe's has become the iconic midtown Manhattan pizza slice stand. While I love their signature thin, crispy crust slices with or without toppings I draw the line at a max 30 minutes wait.  The service is capable and efficient. The old school Greenwich Village feel is easy to upkeep and draws in the tourists.  Joe's is as reliable as they come.",0.91
8-Jul-24,"Surprised this place has a line out the door! Came here at the recommendation of several friends and was sadly disappointed. The SO and I came here at the tail end of our 10-hr day in NY, excited to try (another) New York slice. Joe's, for some reason, is famous? or just a tourist trap. Once you've endured the line outside, you then fight through the crowd inside to place your order and pay.We ordered: - Plain cheese - it is what it is. The sad thing was the crust was tough, burnt, and dry. It felt like a chore to chew through. - Supreme - the SO said this was just OK and compared it to an earlier pizza place that we went to. It's pricier for a lower quality slice of 'za. As non-locals, we did not know you're not able to customize slices. So when we tried to ask, the person helping us had a lot of trouble understanding and kept trying to add another slice to our order. After a little back-and-forth, we just scrapped it and went with our original order. In the end, glad we tried (I guess?), but will be checking out other spots next time we're in the city.",0.4531
7-Jul-24,"Definitely worth the wait and hype. 10/10If you want real Pizza in NYC, this is the spot.",0.5994
7-Jul-24,"Hands down the best pizza ever! The line was sooo long but it moved very fast. The employees were very quick to take your order as well. There's limited seating inside and outside of the restaurant, but there's plenty of tables and chairs across the street. The pizza was so fresh and came out hot. The amount of sauce to cheese ratio was perfect. I highly recommend this place even if the line is long!",0.9532
6-Jul-24,The pizza was awesome!! 100% fresh since they're turning pizza over like crazy! The service was professional and friendly. The ambiance gave NY as expected! We are going back again today.,0.8972
5-Jul-24,"Pretty good NY slice. I got the pepperoni slice and liked how crispy the bottom was, despite how thin the slice was. I'd avoid the Times Square location, as the wait time to order was 30+ minutes for us around dinner time.",0.7717
5-Jul-24,"For me, Joe's didn't live up to the hype.  It was a very long line, which was expected.  When we got our pizza, the ingredients didn't seem to be anything special, meaning not better tasting or fresher.  The crust was a little tough for my liking too.  We actually ordered pepperoni and veggie slices, but I forgot to get a picture of the veggie.  The pepperoni pizza was a little better because the oil from the pepperoni softened the crust a little bit.If in NYC, you need to try Joe's Pizza because it is iconic.  However, after having it once, I would not recommend it right away while there are so many other options to try first.",-0.5968

30-Jun-24,"We ordered supreme and the tomato cheese pizza. I thought that it was like Margarita pizza, but doesn't taste anything like it. We enjoyed the supreme pizza so we ordered a whole pizza Togo to take home to North Carolina.This place is busy, always a long line. I recommend it so try it out .",0.9633
26-Jun-24,"I recently tried New York-style pizza for the first time at Joe's Pizza. We waited in line for over 30 minutes and ordered a Classic Cheese Slice and a Fresh Mozzarella Slice. The sauce on the Classic Cheese Slice was juicy and well-balanced, and the dough was thin and crispy, which we really liked. However, the Fresh Mozzarella Slice was dry and not as enjoyable. The service was fast and efficient; they simply take a slice of pizza and heat it for you. Despite the good service, I don't think I'll return because it's too crowded and seems popular mainly because it's a famous tourist spot.",0.8167

21-Jun-24,Honestly it's good but you'll still catch me going to dollar slices... but def worth everyone giving it a try,0.8126
20-Jun-24,"4 As other reviewers recommended, I ordered online which ended up being a godsend! The line was out the door and we bypassed the entire line - when we got to the register, the cashier knew who we were (based on the 'ready by' time of our order), handed us our pizza and we were on our way. We ate in our hotel room as it is a cramped spot for a family of 4 hence the lower 'stars'. Also felt like the onions on our combo pizza made it taste too sweet. Overall, would recommend this pizza joint and go there again. Would definitely order ahead of time as we did!",0.9449
20-Jun-24,"About time I join the queue for Joe's Pizza (1435 Broadway) and now I know why the queue is so long! Authentic NY street pizza and is truly the best in town!

Wonderful establishment, bustling hungry people from locals to visitors to take in the best pizza in NY!",0.9754

Another perks of this place is that they're open till 4am; perfect place for late night cravings. You can either order pizza slices or a full pizza pie. You can choose from Plain Cheese, Supreme, Meat Lover, Veggie and White Mozzarella. There are a few tables with high chairs available inside the restaurant that you can have your pizza or you can use the benches in the (all seasons) patio.I strongly recommend ""White Mozzarella Pizza"".",0.9794

I would give this a 3.5 if Yelp had half star ratings. I've had much better slices elsewhere which is too bad cause I really wanted to enjoy a great NY slice.

6-Jun-24,"We came here after a 3pm Broadway show for a slice of pizza. It was around 7:30pm and the line was LONG! Luckily, it was moving quickly. We got from the end of the street into the door in around 30 minutes. We probably wouldn't have waited except...Spiderman. (For those that don't know, the other location was in the Spiderman movie.)The service was quick. They have a covered area with tables outside you can stand at you eat your pizza. The slices are NY sized for sure, so come hungry!It was a fine experience overall, but the pizza wasn't that great. I got the Margherita slice and he for the pepperoni slice. I was surprised at how bland it was. Mine didn't even taste salted. Even the basil was a mild flavor. Also, the bottom on one of his slices was pretty burnt. Next time, I will probably try somewhere further away from Times Square.",0.7178

We ordered 4 slices: Supreme (2), Fresh Mozzarella (1), Pepperoni (1), and a pizza with fresh tomato slices (1) I don't remember the name unfortunately but THAT was our favourite pizza, with thick cut slices of firm fresh tomatoes!! Supreme, not so much. It had a lot of topping so the flavour was less distinct. The good news they warmed up the slices and packed it in a pizza box.PS these are thin crust. You will be disappointed if you want thick crust or deep dish.",0.8747
5-Jun-24,Joe's pizza was great! It was quick tasty and traditional nyc pizza with lots of flavors and options to choose from. I highly recommend the spinach garlic as this was my favorite of the ones we tried!,0.8879
5-Jun-24,The food was amazing along with the service. Such helpful and friendly staff. I loved the pictures on the wall of everyone they've met throughout the years of serving pizza. It's very nice to look at as you're eating. Loved this place and would come back anytime im in nyc.,0.967
2-Jun-24,Famous Pizza in Time Square! The pizza is just ok but the experience to taste it is worth it. There's always a long line here meaning the pizza are good or its just worth it to try. Many celebrities went here.  Picture of them are all over the wall.,0.857
2-Jun-24,I don't get ny style pizza if this is considered it. Just not that good or that much flavor. Guess nyc pizza just not my thing.  I like the soft crust and folding it but that's about it. Need to try some majors. Had baked by Luigi too and thought same thing.,-0.3089

Orderly lines, orders taken, payment, hot slices or pies delivered in seemingly seconds.  The dining room is somewhere between small and non existent so to go is your best option or be prepared to make new friends with closely packed strangers.

23-May-24,"Mainly came here to try Joe's pizza because of Toby Mcguire and his influence on me through his Spiderman films.For the price, iconic aspect, location, variety of pizzas to choose from, and the late hours of operation it's worth to stop by and try at least once.Expect long lines that move rather quickly and be sure you know what to order so you're not holding up the lines because believe me you do not want to be THAT person especially in a busy city like manhattan. Pizza's in my opinion are ok not great. They're typical new york style thin crust. Sauce needed more flavor.More of a pizza spot based off the hype.",0.2924

20-May-24,"Went on vacation to New York and the first stop had to be joes pizza! I got a recommendation from friends/family for this trip and I wanted to give as many things as I can a try. Overall thoughts about Joe's pizza, I thought it was okay, it was a cool experience to get to try a traditional slice in New York. The line was crazy long, because like us the tourists all wanted to try it out, and probably also because it definitely is on the cheaper side compared to all the other things in New York. It was pretty cool though seeing the ""as seen on Spider-Man"" sign inside the shop though. I also realized after we got our pizza that the white forgot the spinach on it :/. I will be visiting again when in New York because it's a good price for a classic slice of pizza",0.9098
20-May-24,"I don't know if it's the best, but it's pretty damn good. I got the cheese slice. The crust was both crunchy and chewy, nice and thin.

I stood in line for at least 20 min and ordered their Supreme Slice (~$6.50), which is basically their meat slice. They reheat your slice for you, which is nice, but mine ended up being so soggy, with the cheese and toppings falling off, even when I ate it right after I paid! Very disappointing.While there's seating, you'll really only get to sit if someone happens to leave their spot at the right time. Overall, I've had better pizza for a more affordable price.",0.8213

The one on Lytle Santa Monica Boulevard is my go to when I go between my two stores in West Hollywood in pico. Near New York pizza is the closest thing. You will find to a good slice of New York pie. Parking is not fun but it's worth fighting for to get this pizza. And if you don't want to fight, then have it delivered. It's a great pie.",0.807

The line was out the door but short and moved fast. The place is cramp with minimal seating but we made do and finished our food quickly. The slices were huge so you can be full off of one. I got the supreme slice ($6.50) which was pretty mid. The flavors were nothing special but I do like their thin and crispy crust. When we left, the line was super long. I would not wait in line if it's more than 30 mins and would just come back during off hours or go to a different location.",0.9657

23-Apr-24,"Okay so I don't get the hype. I'm from San Diego and Detroit and we have better pizza there. I came here five years ago and it was better then. The quality of the cheese and dough must not be the same quality. I'm sure it's hard as a business owner and your name is so popular, so it doesn't really matter about the quality. I don't know why there was a huge line but it was gross. It was hard chew also I woke up with a stomach ache. The staff are really nice",0.3823
23-Apr-24,"I went here for a quick slice after getting out of work... or so i thought. The line was pretty long on Tuesday afternoon maybe 15minutes just to order. Slices were heated and did not taste the freshest. This was good pizza, but not great... especially for the price of 5.50 a slice. Theres plenty of other spots that are better and equally priced. Very average slice thats more famous for its reference in movies. There were plenty of pictures and decor that were nice to look at! But not too much seating, they did however have standing room to stand and eat which was good. Again its good and the better spots on broadway if youre in the area and not willing to travel farther to the lower east side or Jersey.",0.9668
22-Apr-24,"Joe's is such a classic. The older I get, the more I appreciate the simplicity of a solid slice of cheese pizza. And Joe's does it well. I recently came to this location around noon on a Saturday. The line was pretty long, but we didn't wait more than 15-20minutes I would say. I ordered a cheese as well as the caprese slice, both of which were solid. It's no gourmet pizza, but it's a good for what it is--fast casual pizza slice. The sauce and cheese ratio was good, it wasn't too greasy, and the sauce wasn't too tart(which I like less tart). They were thin and held well. The cheese was a little flimsier and less crisp than the Caprese though. The caprese pizza tasted really fresh and healthy. But overall I enjoyed classic cheese slice better. The crust was crispy but didn't have much flavor, but I don't eat my crusts anyways so not a problem for me!The one downside is that it's just impossible to find proper seating inside, so keep that in mind!",0.9868
22-Apr-24,"Joe's is very good pizza.  It has become too much of a tourist spot, I am not going to wait in line for an hour to get a slice.  There are many other very good pizza places.  I usually go for an early lunch 11:30a you can typically get in and out easily during this time.",0.831

My 20-something daughter and I shared 4 pieces. We thought we'd have to take some back to the hotel, but because the dough is so thin, we ate them all! Our faves were the fresh mozzarella, supreme, caprese, and pepperoni in that order. We coulda eaten a whole pie of the mozzarella one. We were hungry, but also it was so simple, but good! Perfect midnight snack.",0.9482

You could tell the workers loved what they do as they worked quick to make and serve their customers. The pizza was hot and fresh. We got the mozzarella tomato and basil. I've never eaten so much pizza in one sitting but I could not put it down. 10/10 if you are ever in New York!",0.981
12-Apr-24,"The story: We are avid NYC lovers and during our last visit we decided to make it a pizza tour of all the highest rated pizza shops in the city. I have to admit, I'm a harsh pizza critic as my dad is a small business owner to a pizza restaurant in Camdenton, Mo. I personally believe he makes the best pizza in the world - so it's hard to receive a five star anywhere else. The service: Everything moved really quickly once you're in line. They are expected to serve quickly so there isn't a lot of time to waste while making your decision. It can feel chaotic, but I really just chalked it up to being the NYC way of doing business. The man behind the cash register made nicknames for each of the customers which I actually found to be endearing. He called my husband ""Mr. Germany"" (assuming because of the blue eyes and blonde hair)? HahaOn the menu: We selected theee slices we wanted to try and just shared each. One supreme, pepperoni, and mozzarella single slices!Overall impression: Joe's Pizza is iconic. There's no doubt about that. From the several cameos in Hollywood movies, to celebrity sittings, venturing here while in the big city is a MUST. You're guaranteed to get the full NY pizza slice experience and it is always busy. We were a short walk away from our hotel so decided to go here for a late night snack after arriving. It was busy, loud, and filled with the aroma of fresh pizza. You could watch the hard workers making fresh dough and pizza behind the counter. The walls are plastered with iconic images of guests they've served over the years. Don't get me wrong, the pizza was good too - but in my opinion you're visiting Joe's Pizza for the overall VIBES!",0.951
12-Apr-24,"While in New York I knew that I had to have a slice of authentic New York pie! We decided to visit the Times Square location, as it was on the way to our final destination. We arrived shortly before noon, and while there was a line, it wasn't crazy long, and it moved pretty quickly.When you enter, you can view the pizza selections from the glass case. You select the slice you want, they throw it in the oven, you pay, and shortly thereafter, they call your name to pick it up. There are a few tables inside, but there is also a set up outside just off the sidewalkI got a slice of fresh mozzarella, and my husband got the supreme. We both enjoyed our selections, and I think it just depends what you're in the mood for. What I liked about the pizza is that it has a flavorful thin crust somehow maintains its integrity and crispy texture.   I'm from San Diego, and while we have some decent pizza places out here, our so-called New York style pizzas are not like this. My slice was more simple, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. It had the right amount of cheese and sauce, and plenty of flavor. I tried to bite of my husband's supreme and the numerous toppings definitely give you a satisfying bite. If I had time to return, I might've ordered that one.I would say that Joe's lives up to the hype and is worth a stop!",0.9901

We ordered online, for a faster pick up and it was about 35 minutes wait to get our pizza. We ordered half cheese and half pepperoni, mushrooms, and artichokes. Pizza slices are really large, this means you get 8 slices per pie (large). Flavor: decent, definitely not the best in town and had we not ordered online, it's not worth the wait.

4-Apr-24,"I'll just add to the million other reviews that the  pizza is solid! I bookmarked them before I flew in and we ordered them via delivery to my hotel. The delivery service was very quick! Like 20mins quick. And my pie was as requested! My only thing is that they don't have different sizes for a whole pizza. It was only 2 of us so we wasted a few slices, which I don't like, lbs! But we enjoyed it. I ordered it twice and I'd order it again. I'd also like to walk in and order and eat right there out of the oven.",0.5184
4-Apr-24,"Iconic NY pizza in the heart of Times SquareFood: huge pizza slices, one slice is definitely good for one person. Or two if you want! My partner and I shared two different slices after a Broadway showing. We wanted to try their most popular slices. The pizza was just okay. Definitely not bad, but not the greatest NY has to offer.Service: service was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary. Expect long lines but each and every person behind the counter is working quickly and efficiently.Definitely worth trying just to say you had classic NY pizza.",0.8406
3-Apr-24,"It was my first time trying NY pizza and it was great! Once we saw the long line outside, we knew we were at the right place. The line moved fairly quickly so it wasn't too bad. Love how most of the places out in the city open late. Overall, pizza was delicious especially the sausage and onions. Would recommend trying them out!",0.8851
3-Apr-24,"Visited this place late night and I was satisfied with everything. The food and vibes were just right in NY. Even though the line can be long, it moves fast. Many people just knows this pizza spot just like in Spider Man. Food: thin slice perfectly",0.8591
2-Apr-24,"Very good NY pizza, great crust.  Tried caprese, white, and supreme.  All good especially the supreme but have had better white before.  Line is way too long though, so it's a try it once place.  Plenty of good pizza in NYC to just spend that much time waiting any time you feel like a pizza.  It's the more expensive of the pizzas we've tried in NYC.",0.9671
2-Apr-24,"I had the white pizza (cannot remember the name), it was fine. There is a slightly longer line but moves a little faster so it's not too bad. The only advantage is the cost and it's less than a 5 minute walk to Bryant Park (this place has no sit downs and no stand ins as well).",0.2675
1-Apr-24,"We waited for about 45 minutes at the Times Square location to try this pizza that has become synonymous with NYC Pizza. They moved people through really quickly, but it was a huge line. I tried the Caprese, Mozzerella, and Supreme Pizzas. They were all tasty, but the thinner crust isn't my favorite. The people were friendly ad the restaurant was packed both inside and in the outside area set aside for patrons to eat. If you want quintessential NYC pizza, this is the place.",0.8855
31-Mar-24,"We had the pizza delivered to our hotel in Manhattan to try the famous NY pizza. Joes was rated #1. We were extremely disappointed. Probably not their fault but it wasn't very warm. But even cold pizza, if it's good pizza is still pretty delicious.  This was not. The toppings were sparse. Very little meat, cheese, or sauce. Sadness.",0.8156
31-Mar-24,"People say it's a tourist trap but honestly the pizza was good. The line was long and it was busy, but it was great service and a cool vibe. You can get equally as good pizza without the line in different parts of the city.",0.9668
30-Mar-24,LOVED IT! Best NY pizza you could find! (I am a California native) but damn I wish they would open on the west coast!!,0.7639
29-Mar-24,"Joe's has always been solid.  They serve a consistently great slice of NY style pizza.  Their sauce is slightly sweet, the crust is perfectly crisp with a little charring underneath and the cheese is the best.  I love grabbing a plain slice and a pepperoni.  But no matter what you order, you cannot go wrong.  If there's a line, don't worry about it, they move quick.  There always seems to be a space to squeeze in to eat your slice.  But it is small inside, so if there isn't room, grab that paper plate and walk down the street.  There is something about eating a folded slice while walking around the city.",0.9359
28-Mar-24,"Joe's pizza was a joy. A true joy. Many know how I stan a pepperoni slice, margherita might be a close second. It's the limited work for my taste buds to get to the zesty pizza sauce. So honestly, this mozzarella slice is literally-- genius. Some bites you want the maximum sauce action!Don't let the long line fool you, it's pizza-- it's gonna move quick. Ate my slice right outside the joint before heading to the train. In short: Joe's is famous for a reason. Did not disappoint!",0.9191
28-Mar-24,"Joe's Pizza was on our itinerary and there was no turning back no matter how long the line was!  This was the Times Square location and even on a weekday at 9pm, the line was out the door.  Most of us in line were NOT locals crazy enough to stand in that line.  Why?  Good marketing has advertised Joe's Pizza to be the best pizza in New York.  Plus it was also featured in the movie Spiderman. We stood in line 35 minutes to order.  Then we waited another 20 minutes for our two pies.  After that it was about a 10 min walk back to our hotel.  It would've been a better experience if we ate the pizza fresh out of the oven but there was absolutely no place to do that at Joe's.  The ordering process is organized chaos as it was shoulder to shoulder inside as people waiting for their pizza was packed with those trying to place their orders. By the time we got back to our hotel, our pies were lukewarm.  Too bad we didn't have a toaster oven in our room.  The thin crusts were good.  The ingredients fresh.  The supreme was tasty and better than any thin slice pizza I've ever had at home.  The large fresh mozzarella cheese portions and thinly sliced tomatoes on our other pie were also very good. The pizza was good, but honestly I wouldn't get pizza from that location if I saw a line.  But we did the tourist thing and not knowing when I'll even return, we had to stand in line.  One wall was filled with photos of the many celebrities who have enjoyed Joe's Pizza.  I offered but they didn't want my picture on the wall.",0.9809

25-Mar-24,"Joe's Pizza has become one of my go-to places in NYC. I first heard about it through word-of-mouth / social media, and knew that I had to try it when I saw that it had a line out the door.Joe's is consistent, I mean CONSISTENT. Each time that I've visited, regardless of restaurant location, the slice of pizza offers the same deliciousness that it did the previous time that I had it. Additionally, despite there oftentimes being a line out the door, service is QUICK as they've definitely gotten a routine down. Don't let the line deter you from getting Joe's! There's not much seating indoors relative to the amount of people that are there, but there is an outdoor area at this location where you can eat!",0.5162
24-Mar-24,"I was amazed at how fast the online ordering process works. We ordered from our hotel. It took us 10 minutes to walk there. There was a huge line out the door, but we walked right up and picked up our online order. It was great! And the pizza was amazing too!",0.9449
24-Mar-24,"Highest quality slices. Long lines and limited seating, but a must visit just South of Times Square.",-0.1154
23-Mar-24,"Whether you think this is a tourist trap or not, you can ignore the fact that they do make delicious pizza. You know the line is out the door for a reason. Yes social media might play a role but many of us heard about Joe's through word of mouth for many many years. So if you want to bypass the long line I suggest coming here past midnight because they do open until 4:00am. It works out perfectly if you're a jet lagged tourist like myself. I stumbled in here on multiple occasions and never regret any one of those visits. The cheese, dough and sauce ratio here is perfect. Joe's definitely got it dialed in. The pizza is consistently good. There are no flappy slices here. The dough holds up with a nice crisp. In my opinion the best slice here is the cheese pizza. There's something enticing about the simplicity of it. It's just so good that you don't dare to try anything else. Even at 2:30am you can find this establishment packed with locals and tourist. Everyone standing by the booth enjoying their own slice while looking up at the wall full of photos of celebrities that have visited in the past. The prices aren't terrible either. It ranges between $4-$5 per slice depending on how fancy you want to get. These guys are hustling and bustling behind the counter so the line does move quick. I'd say don't get discouraged by the line and try it at least one time. You be the judge.",0.9947
23-Mar-24,Amazing!  Well worth the wait which was actually not too long. The line goes by fast!  Must go to for nyc pizza!,0.826
22-Mar-24,"Went here twice during my recent trip to NYC. Great tasting pizza and great service!! There was a line out the door both times I visited, but it moves fast. Individual slices are pretty fresh and tasty. If you want a freshly made pie, then order a whole pie, they will make it fresh for you, it's worth the wait!! I waited about 10min extra for a fresh pie.  Believe the hype!!!",0.9691

21-Mar-24,"The pizza here is very good (4 out 5 stars), but not the best pizza by the slice I've ever had or even close to it.  Thus, baffled why I just walked by it and saw a line that was about a block long (not the first time I've seen such a long line).  Absolutely, not worth a long wait. Atmosphere is equivalent to any ""dive' mom & pop style pizza place.  They could clean the tables and take out the garbage more often!  The experience is 2-3 stars. The pizza is 3.5 to 4.0 stars.",-0.7553
18-Mar-24,"It was our first time in New York and we had to go here for our first meal. We ordered 4 different pizza slices to try. The line was quick and there are not much seats inside.

There is a reason why they are famous: their pizza is delicious!",0.7901

We got a few slices and enjoyed them back at our hotel. (There are just a few tables inside, so be prepared to take your pizza to go.) The pizza was really great. We tried a few different slices, and they were all great. Hope to stop by soon for another slice after a show.",0.9741

11-Mar-24,"Acceptable but I don't think it's worth the wait if you're a New Yorker.   Service is quick enough.  Maybe too quick. Ambience is minimal but they have tables inside and outside.  On to the important stuff.  Sauce is bright and flavorful.  Crust is nice, crispy even in the middle and is sturdy enough to withstand a fold.  That said, it's only about par for a slice.  My supreme slices weren't reheated in the ovens long enough and they didn't ask if I was staying or taking it to go.  I immediately dug into one slice and it was still lukewarm.  Came early with colleagues to beat the crowds but honestly it's a middling slice.  I'd be upset if I had to wait 30 minutes of more which seems possible during prime times where the lines are 20 deep out the door.",0.9423

9-Mar-24,"New Yorkers...juuuuust, wait a second. I am by no means trying to ruin the New York experience but...I'll admit upfront, I have a bias toward Chicago pizza. Maybe, just maybe, I rated this by comparing it to the sauce, decadent square cuts of Chicago THIN pizza....yummy! Yup, I'll admit it. So, I say all of that to say this, if you have a taste for New York pizza and you want a good representation of that while being in NYC, sure..wait in a fast moving line, get served a slice by a wonderful staff ( seriously great service), in a very clean atmosphere despite the pizza box trees outside LOL, then do yourself a favor an get yourself a slice her. That crust edge was like that...very good. But, if you are like me and used to Chicago THIN crust, know this..overall, your taste buds will only be satisfied in the Windy City. Sorry/ Not Sorry.",0.9519
5-Mar-24,Waited in a quick moving line for a slice when I was walking through Times Square. Crispy crust and delicious pepperoni. Definitely going to go there again before we leave!,0.7574
3-Mar-24,This was pretty good but not worth the hype. Waited in line almost 45 minutes to get a few cheese slices. Sauce was bland and the pizza needed more salt. The crust's flavor was decent but didn't have any complexity. Parmesan helped but it just didn't meet my expectations. Prices were pretty good and the cashier was super nice. I definitely wouldn't wait in line again. Overall 7/10,0.9744
2-Mar-24,"I'm not from NYC but I was told this is a great, if not the BEST representation of nyc pizza. And I hope it is because it was incredible. Small space but seating inside and outside, they have super kind staff and some clear regulars. Cannot wait to go back!",0.9627
2-Mar-24,"What amazes me about Joe's is how consistent they are. Every single time I've had it it's been the exact same high-quality slice. It truly is an NYC institution. No matter the time of day, there's almost always a line, but they're a well oiled machine and they move fast. They have several locations, which are all more or less the same high quality slice. You can't go wrong. After all, it is ""the quintessential New York slice.""For all the tourists looking for a slice of pizza, you cannot go wrong here. This is the best, most well-rounded example of New York pizza.",0.9559

28-Feb-24,"I didn't find Joe's Pizza to be all that people hype it up to be. Honestly, I didn't really like it at all. The cheese pizza was plain and basic, not very good. The Margherita/caprese was pretty bad. There were slices of raw tomato and mozzarella that weren't even cooked, really weird and not good.",-0.7064
22-Feb-24,"Another late night craving in New York satisfied by Joe's Pizza. I mean, it's New York, and Pizza. Iconic. Classic. Epic. Never goes out of style. We ordered this on our Uber ride home from the Taylor Swift concert in Jersey. They showed up at the same time we did and it couldn't have been a better way to end a really long, exhausting, awesome, life-altering day. Comfort food. Huge pizza slices. Check. Check. When in New York with late night cravings, count on joes to get you fed",0.8215
21-Feb-24,"Sorry New Yorkers. Joe's is very very overrated. The only thing going for it is they get the crust to a pretty decent crispness. Otherwise the food is flavorless. The sauce is plain, the dough is plain, the cheese is plain... If Joe's is  considered, the best, it frightens me to think about what the other pizzas in the City taste like. Oh yeah, don't forget to count how many slices you buy so you can tell the cashier otherwise he's going to roll his eyes and have a snide comment.",0.8679
21-Feb-24,"I went here a few weeks ago for an authentic slice of New York style pizza, and it did not disappoint! Although the place was packed since it was lunch time, the wait time was less than 5 minutes to order and receive the food. Staff was very efficient, the slices of pizza were quite large and thin, so I ate 2 slices and felt satisfied! The sauce and cheese flavor was great, and the extra seasonings provided around the room made the pizza perfect. There were no COVID restrictions, and seasonings were passed around the room, but there were people constantly taking trash out so it never piled up. Some people did leave their trash on the table which was inconvenient, but most everyone cleaned up after themselves. Loved the ambiance of eating on one of the busiest streets, so overall, would come back again!",0.8934
20-Feb-24,"This might be in the top two pepperoni pizzas for me in NY. The slice had great structural integrity, great ratio of sauce, cheese, and mildly spicy pepperoni. I think pepperoni is the slice to get here, the other two slices (cheese and fresh mozz) were not as good. Still tasty, but I fear it needed the extra meatiness the pepperoni provided. There was about a 10-15 minute wait at 10 PM on Wednesday night, and once were were inside, we were in and out within 5 minutes. They're really fast here and service was friendly. It's cozy once you're inside, no bathroom though. Your best bet is to eat it at the tables outside once you've received your pizza or to stand and eat!",0.8895
20-Feb-24,The pizza was great! We got a cheese and pepperoni. The pizza are huge. A perfect New York slice!,0.893
18-Feb-24,"I am sad to say this is definitely a tourist trap. I wanted to like the pizza. But it lacked flavor. I always order plain cheese. Because you shouldn't be able to screw that up. The bottom of my pizza was also burnt, to the point where I didn't finish because I didn't want the burnt taste left in my mouth.",-0.2577
17-Feb-24,"I am always in search of good pizza, the kind that almost tastes better the next day cold, and Joe's pizza fits that bill. The pizza is thin crust, well seasoned, and has the right ratio of cheese to sauce. The supreme slice was my fave of the four, caprese, pepperoni and mushroom. Soooo good... worth the wait!",0.9566
17-Feb-24,"I was told this was a must try so after flying cross country, this was the first thing on my list! Located by Times Square, it was an easy walk. The line was daunting at first, but it went by pretty fast. Service was great; the cashier was able to maintain a fun banter all while moving the line along swiftly so kudos to him!My dad and I ordered the pepperoni, supreme, fresh mozzarella, and white slices. All came out piping hot since they rebake the slices in the an oven before they hand it to you. All were absolutely delicious but my personal favorite was the fresh mozzarella; the cheese pull was insane!Pro is that they are opened late which was great since we were really craving a late night snack. Con is that there is limited seating. There was some outdoor tables (no seats) but since it was pretty chilly outside, my dad and I were lucky to have snagged a table indoors. Definitely recommend this place for its late hours, awesome service, and for the New York Pizza Experience. I personally did not think it was anything super extraordinary (maybe it was too hyped up?) but I would probably go here again or take someone here when visiting.",0.998
16-Feb-24,"My recent experience at Joe's Pizza in New York was marred by exceptionally bad customer service. The staff exhibited rudeness and impatience, particularly when customers needed assistance in deciding what to order. This unwelcoming behavior significantly detracted from the dining experience, and I left feeling disappointed and frustrated after 2 hours long wait. It's crucial for the establishment to address these issues promptly to improve overall customer satisfaction.",-0.8516
15-Feb-24,"I have to admit, my experience at this place was a bit of a mixed bag. Despite the long line down the block, the staff worked with lightning speed, getting us in and out in record time. While I appreciated their efficiency and friendly demeanor, I couldn't help but feel underwhelmed by the pizza itself. Despite the hype, it tasted ordinary, lacking any standout flavors or memorable elements. Nevertheless, the seamless service and pleasant atmosphere made our visit enjoyable, even if the food didn't quite live up to the hype.",0.9026
13-Feb-24,"I like Joe's and think it's a reliable place to get a decent slice of pizza (esp late at night), but I don't think it's worth allll of the hype. If you go, there will likely be a long line; however, the line moves pretty quickly. It's cash only (at least since the last time I've been) and a more expensive slice, compared to other pizzerias, so be prepared with cash.The only real critique about the pizza is that the sauce is a little sweeter than I'd like; however, the thickness and cook is great!  If you've never been, I think Joe's Pizza is an establishment that you should try at least one time in New York. It's definitely not a bad place to get pizza, and I would get it if I happened to be in the area, but I don't think it is the best pizza in New York like some people claim.",0.9876
11-Feb-24,Very good pizza!!! The wait is VERY long. The line can stretch down the block at certain hours and it's standing tables only. Your best bet is to order online for pick up so you can skip the line. The last pie I got was too much sauce not enough cheese and way too much crust space - but still a very good pie!,0.8675
11-Feb-24,"To preface, Joe's has always been my favorite pizza place. I love the sauce to cheese ratio, the crust. It's the perfect NY slice imo. However last night we had a pie delivered ( half plain, half mushroom + pepperoni) that came to +$50 with tax and tip that was not the Joe's that we know and love. The crust was rubbery, not as thin or crispy as usual and half burnt. Was super disappointed and expect more from Joe's. The upside was that delivery was fast and pie arrived hot.",0.9509
10-Feb-24,"After repeatedly passing by this place during my stay in New York, I couldn't comprehend why there was always a line around the corner. Finally decided to join the queue today to sample their white pizza and pepperoni pizza, and I must confess, it was perhaps the finest pizza I've ever tasted. Now, I fully comprehend the lengthy queues.",0.296
8-Feb-24,Pizza was good and you can't beat the price at $1 for a slice.  Was a little sketchy as it's a really small space and there were some sketchy people jammed in there all trying to buy a cheap dinner.,0.4404

2-Feb-24,"joe's is classic. for me it's a must get when in NYC. this 5 star review is for the service, workflow, and how tasty the pepperoni pizza is. i have indeed also tried other flavors like caprese, cheese, and others but i must say i only like pepperoni from joe's. what's yummy about this pepperoni slice is that even when it's cold, it tastes good. it's always gonna be special for me and i'll always get it when in NYC!",0.9538
31-Jan-24,"I hate to say it, but mine was burnt. I showed it to the guy he had to replace it. I think they leave it in the oven too long and it's a very thin crust.",-0.3919
31-Jan-24,"Braving the line at Joe's Pizza is a rewarding experience. Though it may wind between a dozen or so people or extend around the corner, the pace is surprisingly swift, so don't be disheartened by the sight of a lengthy queue. During my visit, I indulged in the delightful variety of flavors offered, ordering four distinct toppings, each proving to be excellent.What sets Joe's Pizza apart is not just the efficiency of the line but also the impeccable quality of their creations. The crust, thin and crunchy with every bite, achieves a good balance with the generous layers of sauce and cheese. Having frequented both this location and others scattered throughout the city, I can attest to the consistent and delicious experience on every occasion.This pizzeria is more than a mere eatery; it's a destination worthy of sharing with friends, coworkers, or family visiting from out of town. New York pizza, exemplified by Joe's, reigns supreme in my culinary preferences. Each slice feels like a little piece of heaven, and the service adds to the charm - swift, kind, and attentive, always accompanied by a friendly smile. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Thank you, Joe's Pizza, for consistently delivering a slice of perfection! Yum!",0.9975
29-Jan-24,"Got there Friday at around 6:45 pm and waited a little over 30 minutes to order. It is very efficient and no-nonsense, which makes sense given the lines. Know what to order when you get to the front.We got 4 different slices total for 2 adults: caprese, regular cheese, cheese with mushroom, and cheese with spinach. We thought the mushroom and spinach would just be $5 since we selected one topping from what they had available, but they put the spinach on a white pizza so it turned out to be $6. The topping selection isn't that clear but I think it is anything that is on an existing pizza on their menu (spinach, mushroom, mozzarella, Italian sausage, olives, etc). Once you order at the counter, they place your slices in the oven to warm it up or melt the toppings on if you added any.The crust had a satisfying crunch to it. The best pizza slices are the ones with few toppings on it -- otherwise the crust can't support the weight and you can't fold it like a true New Yorker! Next time I would skip the caprese, since the tomato and mozzarella felt cold and out of place. The cheese slice was perfect though -- warm and gooey cheese on a crispy crust. They added a LOT of toppings for the custom cheese ones, so it made it a bit soggy, but maybe you could request a smaller amount.Eat your pizza right away! The crust does feel drier and more stale after a few minutes. Enjoy :)",0.9815
28-Jan-24,"Great place for a slice. Large slices and a great variety of pizzas. The line does look intimidating. It moves super fast. Don't let it prevent you from a great tasting slice. They don't sell beer but have many flavors of soda & water. I was so slathering to eat my slice of pepperoni, sausage, and red onion slice. I didn't take any pics. I know, what a loser.",0.3639
28-Jan-24,"This location of Joe's is not far from Times Square and it always seems pretty crowded. I've seen the line go around the corner but it was only probably 20-30 people deep on a chilly Saturday afternoon so we jump in line.  The line moves pretty quickly...10 minutes and we are ordering. You gotta go with the standard cheese slice so we order 4 and we also get the pepperoni/mushroom/sausage/onion slice.  We score a few seats inside even though seating is sparse. Sprinkle on the mandatory garlic powder and take a bite...yeah, very good slice and worth the wait. The crust is crunchy and thin and the cheese with the slightly sweet sauce is spot on with my memories of a NY slice. Very good....Now I'll also give you the Yelp Elite insight folks expect...the one complaint I have is the crust is on the thin side and gets a bit dry because there isn't enough sauce and oil there. I know some folks will agree that one of the best bites on a tasty NYC slice is right at the intersection of the crust and the pizza with the dripping oil, sauce and maybe some cheese if you are lucky.  The crust tastes almost cracker like which is a bit disappointing.  I usually gobble down anybody's left over pizza crust but had to pass this time as it was too dry.  Maybe it was the slices we got?  Not sure but I'm willing to go back and verify myself in the future.",0.9753
27-Jan-24,Every time I go to NY I make a pit stop at Joes! Hands down my favorite slice I've tried in nyc. The lines are usually pretty long and I think we waited maybe 30-40 mins this last time I visited! Seating is limited inside but they do have a tent out front for more standing space to eat. Highly recommend!!,0.785
21-Jan-24,"My friend from Utah  who went to school in NJ (even he agrees NJ is superior for pizza haha) asked me, ""hey do you know where joes pizza is?""Me: ""which one?"" (Lol)But we were meeting near the theater district, so I said this one would be ok for his purposes.So I'm always amused with how many non-touristy trappy places there is to go in this area, the lines for this pizza is down the block.  I guess if you're afraid of falling off the face of the earth, this is the place.And I've had better. But again, I've got serious pizza trust issues. Maybe I'm not the best source? And as the sayeth goes, even if pizza is bad, it's still pretty ""good.""",0.6692

14-Jan-24,"Had some Joe's after not trying it my whole life for no good reason. Tried some pepperoni, cheese Scillian, and supreme - it's ok. Not sure how things have evolved over the years but these days the taste is fine but not worth waiting in a 30 minute line in freezing weather to get a New York slice - any nearby joint to your present NYC location will provide a comparable pie. Joes is classic, super thin, super floppy, super greasy, super cheap NYC pizza with OK taste.",0.9844
14-Jan-24,"Service: quick! The line is usually long every time I come to joes but it moves fast. I usually don't wait more than 15min. The staff are pretty efficient and approachable, even to newbies. No need to be scurred ordering. Food: the best New York slice pizza I've tried so far imo, it's well done and fresh!! I love the crispy cracker bottom with well proportioned toppings and the cheese is amazing. Ambiance: very authentic Italian vibe, the walls are full of all the celebrity, well known names pictures and autographs who come to eat there. I try to go every time I go to nyc because it's pizza just how I like it  definitely recommend any location.",0.9931
13-Jan-24,"I get it, Joe's is close to Times Square, so it's convenient for the tourists and Broadway crowd but really?  That line.  They make an okay slice but there's so much better if you put a little effort in. Get off Broadway and explore a bit - you probably won't have to deal with a long line and you'll be more satisfied with your slice.",0.8947
12-Jan-24,Tourist attraction but not the best pizza in NY. I'd recommend asking locals for other pizza joints in NYC.,-0.0777
12-Jan-24,The service was very fast and organized. We enjoyed the food. The line was long but it went by really fast. If you are in the area then it's definitely worth trying.,0.7935
10-Jan-24,"Soooo good omg. Each slice will run you about $5-6 but it's so thin, crispy, flavorful omg.  All the veggies on the pizza are so aromatic! Would def recommend!! I got super lucky without a wait and was able to go straight to the counter when I ordered at 4pm on a Wednesday.  Super fast and so delicious!",0.9858
9-Jan-24,I don't know but New York think crust pizza just hits different.  So good.  Long line out the door but it moves quickly.  A few tables inside and standing booth outside to eat your delicious pizza.  Ordered one slice of cheese and one margarita pizza.  Both were absolutely amazing something about the crunchy crust and sauce.  Cheese is so good you don't need any toppings.,0.9693
9-Jan-24,Line is always long. Worth the wait if you have never tried it. We ordered a full pie or classic pepperoni pizza and it did not disappoint. There are many options all along the streets of New York but this place stood out with from the crowd. Waited about 40 mins in line and took about 15 minutes for the fresh pie to come out. Snag a seat when you can!!!,0.71
8-Jan-24,"Joe's Pizza offers a solid experience with enjoyable, authentic NY-style pizza. While not a life changer, it's a good choice for a tasty meal. The wait in line might not be worth it, but ordering for delivery is a convenient option. My favorite slice of all was the Mozzarella slice, followed by the pepperoni being second.",0.7825
7-Jan-24,Best pizza slice ever. It lives up to the hype and the popularity. It should certainly be a must when you visit New York,0.8658
6-Jan-24,There was a line around the building but it went by pretty quick. The pizza was good but I think it's more the nostalgia of the place. I've had better pizza in NYC. The service was great though.,0.962
4-Jan-24,"Super long line out the door, but was sadly disappointed with my first New York pizza experience. They ended up getting our order wrong and also was missing a slice of pizza, which they were able to remedy when I went back in, but the pizza was very dry - was hoping for a juicy cheesy pizza but was left a bit disappointed.",-0.9247
3-Jan-24,"Terrible service, especially for online pickup.   Received email pizza was ready and showed the cashier the order number.  Ended up  waiting 20 minutes  . It was packed up and on top of the oven sitting there.The cashier blamed me that I told him I ordered a ""pizza supreme"". He never asked me what I ordered.Service is terrible and he told me I should complain to the online payment platform when it was obviously his fault. So I am complaining here!!",-0.9111
2-Jan-24,"Margarita pizza was solid w a crunchy crust, good flavor in Sauce. I wasn't blown away, but it was a decent pie.",0.3071
2-Jan-24,"Very long lines but it goes quickly. Various options available. Price was expensive ($5-6) per slice. The pizza was thin like a true NY pizza should be but you're gonna need 2-3 slices to fill you up. At that point, there are better options around town.",0.8957
1-Jan-24,"PIZZA "" FULL OF FLAVOR"" SERVICE - AMAZING The place is small but perfect they have a lot of seating . The good thing about this place is that it was down the street so it made it very convenient for me . trust me the pizza is really good here you must try this place !!",0.9704
1-Jan-24,"After arriving into NYC late Christmas Eve due to flight issues and running into issues with Uber and having to take multiple cars, the wife made it to our hotel first with half of the kids, and was given the heads up from the hotel staff that joes was right around the corner and if we ordered ahead of times it would be ready and we could skip the line! Game on!! We checked in, ordered, dropped our bags in the rooms and took a stroll around the block to walk in and grab the pizzas zero wait! Let's go, in NYC less than an hr and a half and I got NY slice in hand now that makes up for the travel chaos we had to start our holiday week. The pizza hot fresh with perfectly made dough that had the right balance of chew and crisp. Add on the garlic powder, oregano and chili flake to take it above the top!! It was so good we ordered some pies 3 out of 6 days after 10pm during the visit! Hands down the best!",0.9596
1-Jan-24,Horrible pizza not cooked enough hella watery food is horrible I wouldn't never come back here,-0.7906
31-Dec-23,Line went around the corner but it moved quickly and the pizza was definitely worth it!,0.7345
30-Dec-23,we got some pizza delivered. the pizza here is a classic new york city slice! the sauce is awesome. the crust was a little hard but thats expected when you get it delivered.,0.4192
29-Dec-23,Had the pepperoni and MargrettaPizza was average.    Not worth the waiting in line.   If line is short get yourself a slice.   My Margretta is why I gave it a 4.   My friend had spinach and garlic and we rate that a little higher.   Pepperoni average.,0.3682
28-Dec-23,"Eh..it's ok, the plain cheese pizza was worth burning the roof of my mouth for and I'd have that one again. The sicilian square was a major letdown, idk if it was a bad batch but the sauce was way too sweet and the cheese was flavorless and came off too easy.",0.8151
28-Dec-23,The best pizza in NYC! So delicious and cheesy! My favorite pizza in New York! There are so many locations too! Easy to deliver to my hotel too!,0.9456
28-Dec-23,"Top pizza I've had in NYC. The pizza is crisp, crunchy, and so flavorful. The pepperoni was more pull-apart cheesy than the cheese pizza, which was surprising. I recommend the pepperoni, but both are a quintessential NYC slice. It gets busy so plan ahead.",0.4019
28-Dec-23,"Best pizza in NY!!! Line was long, we waited 40 mins but it was totally worth it. I inhaled two and a half spiced!",0.762
27-Dec-23,Thin pizza with great taste. Lines are LONG but they do move fast. Seems to be the place where celebrities go,0.3716
26-Dec-23,Line is long but we moved up pretty quickly. It was a lot of fun for the two of us finishing 6 slices of pizza! It's worth every minute waiting.,0.908
25-Dec-23,"Ordered a couple of pies for delivery while in town (so I wouldn't have to stand in the long line on the street). Excellent pizza, both plain cheese and plain pepperoni. Delivery was pretty quick too.",0.7845
24-Dec-23,"Absolutely delicious and authentic NY pizza. You're going to have to wait in line for a while and you probably won't be able to eat inside because it's a small place, but it's so worth it. The fresh mozz and pepperoni are everything we hoped for when planning our first trip to NYC.The slices are huge too. So fresh and tasty! Just go get it. You won't regret it!",0.9664
24-Dec-23,The line was sooooo long. Was it worth the wait? Maybe.  The regular pizzas were good. The pepperoni was DELICIOUS! Stick to the classics and you can't go wrong. The white garlic and spinach pizza was lacking flavor.There was a couple indoor spots that you can stand and eat inside at. They have lots of pictures on the walls of the stars that visited Joe's Pizza in the past.HAPPY PIZZAING!,0.9076
21-Dec-23,"Worth the wait! After walking up and seeing the very long line, I did really question whether of not it was worth it. IT IS, great pizza and salad, friendly staff, fun environment!",0.9085
17-Dec-23,Good pizza! Not much else to say. Must try if you come to NYC. It's always fun to watch them make the pizzas in the back too. Crazy atmosphere but entertaining no doubt!,0.1984
17-Dec-23,Best thing about times square for sure. the line is crazy long but there's a good reason and it goes quicker than you think. order online to cut the line for p/u. the dude that runs the till at night is top rate. much love from the west coast you guys made my 1st trip to nyc and i'll definitely be back.,0.946
16-Dec-23,I don't think this place needs a review since it is always crowded even at 2 am!!!!!  They always serve fresh hot pizza. It is so delicious that I had to get a large one a flew back to LA with it!,0.8485
15-Dec-23,"Good pizza, worth the wait. Wanted to try every pie they had out. Ended up going straight cheese and didnt regret it.",0.7925
14-Dec-23,The quintessential staple for pizza in NYC. I've had Joe's several times and it never disappoints. It's my go to for takeout pizza. Any time I have a team activity this is my default pizza place.,0.2924
14-Dec-23,"In NYC with the family and wanted pizza.  Read reviews about Joe""s and thought let's do it.  Had to wait in line but it was worth it.  Pizza was very good.",0.7677
13-Dec-23,"For all the people trying to decide if standing in a line for half an hour or more for Joe's is worth it...SAVE YOUR TIME. It is vastly overhyped. If you do decide to wait anyway, when you get to the door, make sure someone in your party snags a spot to sit in while you wait to get to the counter to order otherwise there is a tent outside to sit under.As for the pizza, it was thin and slightly burnt and it tasted like...ordinary pizza. There wasn't anything that set it apart from other pizza.If I could've walked in and order a slice without the huge line, I'd think this place was alright. But the hysteria really made this place subpar.",-0.2218
13-Dec-23,"Tried going at night and the line was around the block, go during the day if you can.We went the next day at around noon and there was no line, tried their cheese, pepperoni, caprice, and white pies. The slices were good, but I didn't think they were spectacular like other reviews might say. Its good new york pizza, nothing really stands out.",0.7579
12-Dec-23,Very busy location and will wait in line to get your pizza it is better to order online and pick up.  The sit down and eat areas are limited.  The pizza itself well we are from Texas an we were mot impressed.  Joes is know due to movies and actors hyping it up but it is just ok.  We had pizza in other restaurants that were way better but that our opinion.,0.8674
12-Dec-23,"Don't come hangry although the line goes by quicker than you'd think - we were around the corner and it took about 30 minutes. Quick and friendly service to order and pay. Personally, I think the cheese and pepperoni are the best. Can't go wrong with the classics! Hot, fresh, cheesy, thin and crispy crust... I'm drooling just thinking about it! Limited seating... the restaurant is small, but tables open up quickly! A must-go if you're a tourist in NY and staying in the area.",0.7471
