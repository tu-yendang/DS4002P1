I went on a Friday night, I'll start by saying that I didn't get the Jamaican buzz while eating at Jamaican jerk biz. The flavors of the food smh...I got the jerk chicken, rice & peas, cabbage, and plantins. The food took 20 minutes to come out right under luke warm. The chicken tasted like it was made in a BP gas station...the rice tasted like rice, cabbage was okay. The only thing that made the plate digestible was the jerk sauce that I had to request because it doesn't come served with the food. My girl got the curry goat with the same sides I got she also had the same disappointing results....food very cold and bland. Did I mention the food in the dine in area is served in styrofoam boxes and plastic utensils? Wouldn't be an issue, but there's a 20% gratuity automatically added to the bill which makes no sense because I could've to my cold food back to the crib if that was the case. Ambiance wise the place was just as bland as the food. I forreal could've took my cold bland food home if I knew I'd be sitting in a Caribbean restaurant listening to nba youngboy, lil Jon, & coi larey. I honestly don't think a soul that works at the restaurant is a bit of Caribbean. Oh did I forget to mention that you also get charged a extra dollar to pay for your meal with a card instead of cash...... yes a restaurant charges youmore to pay with a card on top of the mandatory 20% gratuity. 2/10 experience. I'd say 0/10 but the waitress was at least nice.\",\n          \"Great food!  The oxtails were awesome.  My husband had the curry goat and loved them.  We had a great experience.
