Data Science Capstone Project 1 - The Keith Lee Effect

## Section 1: Software and Platform
* The primary software used for this project was Python, specifically using Interactive Python Notebook files (ipynb). These files were created and used with Google Colab. Additionally, data was read in as CSV files.
* The packages used were pandas to read the CSV files as dataframes, nltk to access the VADER Sentiment Analysis tool, and matplotlib's pyplot to create graphs and figures.
* Three laptops were used, where two devices used Mac, while one was conducted on Windows.

The type(s) of software you used for the project.
## Section 2: Documentation Map
Section 2: A Map of your documentation. In this section, you should provide an outline or tree illustrating the hierarchy of folders and subfolders contained in your Project Folder, and listing the files stored in each folder or subfolder.
## Section 3: Reproducing Results Instructions
 Instructions for reproducing your results. In this section, you should give explicit step-by-step instructions to reproduce the Results of your study. These instructions should be written in straightforward plain English, but they must be concise, but detailed and precise enough, to make it possible for an interested user to reproduce your results without much difficulty. N.B. This section will be crucial for the CS1 assignment, where you'll be required to reproduce the results of other groups. Therefore, make sure to explain this section thoroughly.
